        "text": "It acts as some sort of baptismal sacrament. Immigrants take their first timid step toward Americanization when they start honoring this sacred holiday and learn to cook its dishes. And thereby, without being fully aware, they begin to incarnate the national spirit.\n\nFIVE CLASSIC THANKSGIVING MOVIES AND SHOWS THAT CELEBRATE FAMILY\n\nIn personal terms, a disposition to be grateful renders important benefits, reducing anxiety and depression, and making us better companions and better sleepers. This is so self-evident that it hardly requires research to substantiate it, but the evidence does exist.\n\nIn geopolitics, the thankful disposition draws a bright line between the United States and wretched states officially devoted to its opposite, ungratefulness. A commitment to gratitude may have been one of the things — right up there with love of liberty — that made America the historic sworn enemy of Marxism, whose guiding ideology, envy, is the wages of ingratitude.\n\nThanksgiving is unquestionably uniquely American. I have lived at least a year in seven countries, in Asia, Europe, and the Americas, many more if one counts shorter stays, and have never encountered anything like it anywhere else.\n\nYes, in East Asia, I experienced firsthand what the Koreans call the Chuseok festival, held on the 15th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar, so from late September to early October, depending on the year. But it’s not dedicated to giving thanks, but rather to the full moon.\n\nCanada, Liberia, and the Caribbean island nation of Grenada also have official Thanksgiving days, but they are derivatives of America’s.\n\nThanksgiving is not just uniquely tied to this country because it is reflective of the American national character. Its lineage is the thread of the national quilt.\n\nAnyone who has watched A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, and its companion, The Mayflower Voyagers, will know the essentials of how the first Thanksgiving was celebrated by the Pilgrims and their Indian hosts in 1621 in the Plymouth Colony. Right there, Thanksgiving starts as a needed slap in the face to the “land acknowledgement” crowd.\n\n(And yes, it might be better to read a book and learn history right and not from Peanuts, but don’t underestimate the value of popular culture in propagandizing the national spirit. When Charlie Brown exclaims at the Thanksgiving table, “We thank the Lord for a bountiful harvest,” Hollywood was telling generations of young Americans that it wasn’t just ok to be patriotic and faithful, but that it was normal and expected.)\n\nThen, in one of its very first acts, the first Congress in 1789 requested that the newly elected President Washington proclaim a national day of Thanksgiving.\n\nBut it wasn’t until later, in the middle of the Civil War and in response to a persistent, decadeslong letter-writing campaign by editor and writer Sarah Josepha Hale, that Abraham Lincoln in 1863 proclaimed the last Thursday in November as our official day of Thanksgiving. Then, just as America was about to enter another war, Congress officially made it the fourth Thursday in 1941.\n\nThus, Congress and our most important leaders ratified an outlook that is the gift that keeps on giving.\n\nExperiencing gratitude is “associated with greater longevity among older adults,” says a Harvard study from last year. According to the British Psychological Society, “around 18.5 per cent of individual differences in people’s happiness could be predicted by the amount of gratitude they feel.”\n\nSaying thanks to your partner and meaning it also makes the institution of marriage stronger. A team at the University of Illinois found that “higher levels of perceived gratitude buffered against the stresses of both financial strain and ineffective arguing.” (One could ask, in marriage, is there any other type of arguing?)\n\nMeanwhile, at UC Berkeley, a 2009 study found that “Gratitude was uniquely related to total sleep quality, subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, and daytime dysfunction.”\n\nBEDFORD SPRINGS DELIGHTS WITH SMALL-TOWN CHRISTMAS CHARM\n\nOf course, Presidents Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt, and the various congresses in question — to say nothing of the Pilgrim fathers, Samoset, or Squanto — did not have any of these benefits in mind; they just wanted to thank the Lord. Maybe the unintended consequences are payback.\n\nOf course, that is not going to help you deal with your aunt who voted for Kamala Harris and will show up dressed in a Handmaid’s Tale outfit. Just tell her that if President Donald Trump and Zohran Mamdani can bury the hatchet, she can get along with others, too.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving.\n\nMike Gonzalez is the Angeles T.

        "text": "Zohran Mamdani, the incoming Mayor of New York City has had a volatile relationship with President Trump. He's called the president a fascist. Trump, in return, has called him a \"little communist mayor,\" and warned that he may send in the National Guard. The administration also said it will expand ICE operations in the city.\n\nBut when the two leaders finally met face to face recently it was, to many people's surprise, cordial. Some may even say warm.\n\n\"We agree on a lot more than I would have thought. I want him to do a great job, and we'll help him do a great job,\" the president said. Soon the internet was flooded with memes of the president looking admiringly up at Mamdani. The next day's New York Post cover read \"I love you Mam.\"\n\nBut many New Yorkers say they're taking it all with a grain of salt and remaining on guard.\n\n\"The president says one thing one day, and a different thing the next,\" says one street vendor outside the subway station in Queens. \"You don't know what's real anymore.\"\n\nWhat she does know is that she's seen an uptick in immigration enforcement recently, which is why she asked that NPR withhold her name. She's undocumented, and she's worried.\n\nEvery morning at around 4:30 a.m., she posts up here and sells refreshments and breakfast. A few weeks ago, a little after setting up, she says several ICE agents jumped out of an unmarked car in pursuit of two workers who'd just bought something to eat.\n\nShe ran into the building behind her, locked the door and hid in the stairway until it was all over.\n\nThis vendor says she loves Mamdani, but worries the president will punish the city for electing a democratic socialist. She fears New York will turn into Chicago or Los Angeles, two cities that have experienced large-scale immigration raids.\n\nThis is a common sentiment in New York these days. The day after the White House meeting, President Trump said that while he's not planning on sending troops into New York now, he would, if needed. NPR reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment and received no response.\n\nMamdani, for his part, reiterated he will defend immigrants in New York.\n\nHis team did not grant NPR an interview, despite multiple requests. But a source close to his transition team who spoke on condition of anonymity told NPR that Mamdani is exploring legal strategies at the local level to limit Trump's actions in New York City, including muscling up the NYC Law Department by adding 200 attorneys.\n\nCongressman Patrick Ryan of the Hudson Valley, a Democrat whose district includes some of New York City's northern suburbs, told NPR that one of the lessons from Chicago and LA is that states can successfully challenge the administration in court. Ryan cites his own background as an Iraq War veteran.\n\n\"To come home to my state and my country, and see the idea of U.S. troops deployed against U.S. citizens and American cities, it's so fundamentally un-American. It's also, by the way, not what young American men and women sign up to do,\" he says.\n\nHe hopes the meeting between Mamdani and Trump de-escalated tensions. But like the street vendor in Queens, he's taking it with a grain of salt. He's hoping for the best, he says, but preparing for the worst.\n\nWhich is what organizers on the streets are doing.\n\nCarina Kaufman-Gutierrez is the deputy director of the advocacy group Street Vendor Project. She says street vendors are among the most vulnerable immigrants in New York. \"Street Vendors are the eyes on the ground right? They see everything that happens.\"\n\nShe's hopeful that the incoming Mayor will be an ally. She says she's also confident New York street vendors are uniquely prepared to weather an ICE campaign. Many of them, she says, see this as \"the next pandemic.\"\n\nThe organization is, in fact, leaning in on pandemic-era strategies for vendors who are scared to work on the streets during immigration raids. \"We have a catering program for example, where people can reach out to us, and we'll connect them to a vendor for catering their event.\"\n\nShe says, something the new mayor could do is make it easier for street vendors to operate — which Mamdani has said he will prioritize. He has pledged to allow thousands of additional license applications for vendors, and repeal criminal liability rules.\n\nMeanwhile, in the cold shade of her stand, the breakfast street vendor looks out at the busy avenue. She wonders how long this liveliness will last, and how long she will endure.\n\n\"Three more years,\" she says, referring to the Trump administration. \"I hope they go by quickly.\"",

        "text": "Thanksgiving is twice blessed. It blesseth those who give and those who receive.\n\nIts origins trace back to 1621, more than four centuries ago, featuring the Plymouth colony, Pilgrims fleeing religious persecution, and the Wampanoag Native Americans who were present long before Columbus purported to discover America in 1492. It was a three-day gathering to celebrate a bountiful harvest and peace fortified by prayer.\n\nThe first Thanksgiving is a reminder of William Faulkner’s wisdom in “Requiem for a Nun”: “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.”\n\nWe continue to struggle with religious freedom. Antisemitism is rampant, spiked by Hamas’s murderous aggression against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, applauded by many anti-Zionists like New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. President Donald Trump recently deplored Nigeria’s “existential threat” to Christians. Buddhist Myanmar has been found guilty of genocide of the Muslim Rohingya by the International Court of Justice. This is but the tip of the iceberg of religious persecution globally that haunts the species.\n\nLet us pause to reflect on James Madison’s 1785 “Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments” saluting religious liberty as an unalienable natural right:\n\n“(W)e hold it for a fundamental and undeniable truth, ‘that Religion or the duty which we owe to our Creator and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence.’ The Religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man; and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate. This right is in its nature an unalienable right. It is unalienable, because the opinions of men, depending only on the evidence contemplated by their own minds cannot follow the dictates of other men: It is unalienable also, because what is here a right towards men, is a duty towards the Creator. It is the duty of every man to render to the Creator such homage and such only as he believes to be acceptable to him.”\n\nPeace with Native Americans did not long endure. Columbus sailed under the aegis of the doctrine of discovery, a 15th-century theory derived from papal bulls on behalf of European colonial powers that dispossessed indigenous people of ownership of the lands they occupied. The United States inherited the doctrine, which provoked chronic conflict and warfare. Consider one of the grievances against King George III penned in the American Declaration of Independence:\n\n“He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.”\n\nThe Trail of Tears, the Sand Creek Massacre, Wounded Knee and similar oppressions of Native Americans are a blight on American exceptionalism. They should humble us to our own shortcomings, and remind us of Matthew 7:3-5: “Why do you see the speck in your neighbor’s eye, but do not notice the log in your own eye?”\n\nLet us always be grateful that all of us have won lottery tickets. The probability of human existence in the Milky Way galaxy is infinitesimal. Be grateful for small things: food to eat, clothes to wear, a roof to sleep under, and friends to enjoy. Life is commonly a sum of trifles.\n\nUse suffering as a source of strength, not despair. Job’s immense losses were more than amply rewarded. The test of character is how you recover from defeat, not how you rejoice in triumph.\n\nAbraham Lincoln proclaimed Thanksgiving a national holiday on Oct. 3, 1863. He summoned us to make it our finest hour in displaying charity and goodwill toward all in our midst.\n\nI am in Israel this Thanksgiving, awed by a nation as much to be marveled at as imitated for perseverance and justice in housing God’s chosen people.\n\nUnsparing gratitude is our salvation.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving to all.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM",

        "text": "If Israel’s genocide in Gaza has been a site of tension in your family for the last two Thanksgiving holidays, this year should be no different. The so-called ceasefire might seem like a good excuse to bury the hatchet and enjoy a quieter turkey dinner, but when we look at the harrowing status quo for Palestinians in Gaza today, there is no peace to be thankful for — especially not on a day that marks the remembrance of this country’s own genocide against Indigenous Americans.\n\nTo be clear, if two years of livestreamed annihilation have failed to shift your loved ones’ support away from the Israeli ethnostate, I doubt there is anything a dinner table argument could do to persuade them. There can be no reasoning with a worldview that forecloses seeing Palestinians as fully human.\n\nI navigate this with pro-Israel members of my own British Jewish family. It’s painful, and I don’t have any good advice. Whatever your approach with your family, there can be no pretense that the genocide in Gaza is over.\n\nFamilies like mine, divided over Israel, are not the important ones here. For my part, I’ll be thinking instead of another family this Thanksgiving: that of my student from Gaza. He escaped in 2024 after Israel bombed his home, killing two of his immediate family members, including his mother. His surviving family are still there, living in tents. He hasn’t heard from them in over two weeks.\n\nIt is for families like my student’s that we cannot simply take it easy this Thanksgiving because of the so-called ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nUnending Destruction\n\nWhile the October 10 agreement has offered some relief for Palestinians, with a significant drop in daily slaughter, displacement, starvation and killings by Israeli forces continue. Instead of relentless, Israel’s bombings over the last 45 days have been simply ongoing and regular. Israel has killed 345 Palestinians in Gaza, including 120 children, while demolishing over 1,500 structures. \n\nAt the same time, only a fraction of the aid trucks which were supposed to enter Gaza daily under the ceasefire agreement have been permitted entry by Israeli forces. Mass, enforced hunger continues in the Strip, where 50 million tons of rubble sits atop well over 10,000 unrecovered bodies.\n\nIn the face of such totalizing and unending destruction, it’s hard to find much solace in the fact that the support for the Palestinian cause has grown internationally; that nearly all major international human rights organizations have recognized Israel’s actions as genocidal; that a major wave of nation-states, including France, Canada, and Britain, moved this year to recognize the state of Palestine. The dead, displaced, and occupied can do little with declarations that carry no concrete consequences.\n\n“What we need is a justice plan,” Mosab Abu Toha, the Palestinian writer and poet, told a U.N. meeting this week. “It is time to stop accepting the illusion of peace processes that only entrench injustices.”\n\nWith the state of the world as it stands, it feels unlikely that Israeli leaders will be held accountable for their war crimes any time soon. Justice for Palestine is hard to imagine, but we can continue to apply pressure in ways that have already seen paradigms shift. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York City mayoral election was a genuine victory against the perverse weaponization of antisemitism against Israel’s critics. Now New Yorkers must push our next mayor to uphold commitments to Palestinian solidarity and international law.\n\nAnd there is more those of us living in safety can do. We can send funds and share resources, as so many already do. And we can continue heading and supporting Palestinians’ call for boycotts, divestment, and sanctions against Israeli institutions complicit in occupation and apartheid.\n\nActivist sometimes say, “Solidarity begins at home.” Yet not everyone can choose their home. If you have the great fortune of spending the holidays with loved ones who share your commitments to justice and liberation, I hope your time together is full of joy. Most of the time, though, solidarity actually begins anywhere but home. So if you choose to spend time with your family knowing that it will be fraught, I wish you luck. The weekend will pass, and there’s urgent work to be done.",

The pair of Democrat progressives would rather “stand up” to Trump — and appease their left-wing base — than work with him to benefit their larger constituencies, meaning the city and the state.\n\nWu, in fact, arrogantly insists that she has no interest in a “bromance” with Trump.\n\nIn one-party Democratic Massachusetts, politics beats policy every time. And the politics call for Democratic office holders to hurl hate bombs against Trump no matter the consequences.\n\nWhat will they do when Trump is gone?\n\nMamdani, the brash 34-year-old mayor-elect of New York City, and a Democratic Socialist to boot, threw the same hate bombs at Trump in his campaign for mayor.\n\nHe called Trump everything from a fascist to a despot.\n\n“We will put an end to the culture of corruption that has allowed billionaires like Trump to evade taxation and exploit tax breaks,” Mamdani said in his belligerent victory speech.\n\nTrump, not to be outdone in the insult department, called Mamdani, among other things, “a nut job” and a “lunatic” communist. He would have labeled him “Moscow Mamdani” had he thought of it.\n\nBut a funny thing happened that changed everything.\n\nMamdani was elected.\n\nHe then realized that he needed help to run the biggest city in the country and keep people safe.\n\nSo, after brutally attacking the New York police, he first asked Jessica Tisch, the effective law-and-order police commissioner, to stay on the job and promised to keep the number of cops at their present level.\n\nThen Mamdani realized that he needed help to pay for all the free stuff he, like a true socialist, promised, things like free day care, free buses, city-run grocery stores, and so on.\n\nBut, instead of reaching out to other Democratic Socialists, like Sen. Bernie Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for instance, who offer nothing but socialist platitudes, he reached out to Republican President Donald Trump, the capitalist who can do things for him and for New York.\n\nIt was a shrewd maneuver on his part, and for Trump as well. Three months ago, nobody knew who Mamdani was, and here he was in the White House meeting with the most powerful man in the world.\n\nThe socialist had come hat in hand asking the capitalist for help.\n\nThe key to the success of the meeting was that the pair discussed what they could agree on — helping New York on affordability issues — while ignoring what they differed on, like ICE rounding up criminal illegal immigrants, law and order, Israel, protecting Jews in New York, and Mamdani’s refusal to condemn the Intifada.\n\nWhile Mamdani stood by a seated Trump, like pupil and teacher, Trump said, “Some of his ideas are really the same ideas that I have.”\n\n“We’re going to be helping him to make everybody’s dream come true, having a strong and very safe New York,” Trump said.\n\nWhile Mamdani faces criticism from militant Trump-hating socialists for cozying up to Trump, it was a bold move on his part. Mamdani put the policy of helping New York over the politics of hating Trump.\n\nOthers should follow suit.\n\nVeteran political reporter Peter Lucas can be reached at: peter.lucas@bostonherald.com.",

        "text": "New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s smile carried him a long way toward being elected. And he used his affability again on Friday, turning the meeting he had requested with President Donald Trump into an Oval Office lovefest.\n\nNow it’s time for the mayor-elect to employ the power of smiling to make day-to-day life better for New Yorkers when they are compelled to interact with city employees. Mamdani needs to call on the 300,000 city employees to show warmth, respect and courtesy to the public. The spirit of a smile.\n\nWalk into a city agency or court building seeking help, and you’re likely to get barked at and herded like a dumb animal. Ask a Metropolitan Transportation Authority employee why the train isn’t coming, and you’re apt to hear, “Can’t you read the sign?” followed by a muttered “dumb f**k.” It’s a bruising experience.\n\nI went to family court at 111 Centre Street last Thursday to be appointed as a guardian for a 95-year-old woman bed-bound in a nursing home. Arriving at the appointed time of 9:30 a.m., I found 80 people, in a line snaking around the outside of the building, waiting to enter and go through the one available metal scanner.\n\nI inched ahead in the line until I was third from the entrance. A burly man in a guard uniform suddenly came through the door, held his arm horizontally in front of me, and yelled an order for all of us to turn around and proceed to the entrance at the back of the building. Everyone who had made it to the front of the line would now be at the back of the line. I calmly said “no,” and that I had waited once and would like to enter, and I started to walk around him to the door. He held his arm out to stop me and barked his order again, adding, “Do you think you’re someone special?”\n\n“Yes,” I replied, adding below my breath, “We are human beings.” I pushed my way around him and into the building, taking the two women behind me in as well.\n\nThe fact is, everyone in that line deserved dignified treatment — but that’s not the treatment being meted out by employees at 111 Centre Street.\n\nWhen I got upstairs, I took a seat outside Judge Ilana Marcus’ courtroom. Noon arrived, and I still hadn’t been called. I pulled open the courtroom door a crack to see if the elderly patient’s case was still being discussed.\n\nAt that point, a court guard pushed through the door, screamed at me for opening the door, and refused to answer any questions about whether I was even in the right hallway. When I tried to speak, she shut me down.\n\nThat’s how people too often are treated in city agencies and courtrooms. And it’s reflected in the low ratings New Yorkers give city services. Only 27% rate them overall good or excellent, reports the Citizens Budget Commission, though New Yorkers give high ratings to fire protection and garbage collection.\n\nBut if you want to see nastiness, visit the McCarren public pool in Brooklyn. As one swimmer commented, “The attendants in the ladies room are definitely from a prison movie.”\n\nThe quality of public services and their delivery were barely mentioned in the many months of mayoral campaigning, with the candidates battling instead over Trump and the fate of Gaza.\n\nTo the extent Mamdani discussed quality of life in the city, he reduced it to one word: “dignity.” He said, “A life of dignity should not be reserved for the fortunate few.”\n\nBut he talked about only one way of restoring dignity: the government’s role in helping working people afford child care or a decent place to live.\n\n“No New Yorker should ever be priced out of anything they need to survive. … It is government’s job to deliver that dignity.”\n\nChild care and groceries cost money, but on day one, Mamdani can go a long way toward helping New Yorkers feel dignified in this hardscrabble city by asking them to be treated with civility.\n\nMamdani should announce a dignity campaign, calling on public employees to treat all of us with civility instead of herding us like animals and barking instructions at us.\n\nHe should take a page out of the 99th mayor’s playbook. Former Mayor Fiorello La Guardia approached a group of city officials incognito and waited while they ignored him. When one of them finally said something, La Guardia shouted back, “Take off your hat when you speak to a citizen,” as he knocked the hat off the worker’s head.\n\nToday, that would be going too far. Working rules forbid it. But in the 1990s, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani also called for more civility from public employees.\n\nThe New York City Police Department had its “Courtesy, Professionalism, Respect” motto. That should be the code of conduct citywide.\n\nTarget is mandating that its in-store workers smile and make eye contact with shoppers. That’s good business. Customers have options.\n\nNew Yorkers sometimes find themselves with no option but to walk into a courtroom, or into a city agency to apply for a permit. But they should get the same courteous treatment as customers with options.\n\nLaunching a civility campaign and putting some energy behind it could help dispel the skepticism and dread many New Yorkers feel about the incoming Mamdani.\n\nPut that grin to work, Mr. Mayor.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM",

        "text": "Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., praised what he called the \"Avengers\" roster of Democratic leaders but left out his own state's governor, Gavin Newsom. CNN host Kasie Hunt asked the California gubernatorial candidate on Tuesday who he believed the leader of the party was after Democratic strategist James Carville claimed there wouldn't be one until the presidential election. Swalwell was more optimistic, comparing current Democratic lawmakers like Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, and Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., to the Marvel superhero team. CORY BOOKER ADMITS DEMOCRATS 'FAILED IN MY GENERATION' IN SCATHING ASSESSMENT OF HIS OWN PARTY \"It‘s the Avengers right now, right?\" Swalwell said. \"You‘ve got Jasmine Crockett coming to California, helping us elevate the vote to pass Prop 50. Ruben Gallego is going to Iowa and New Hampshire as a Marine, Latino, first in his family to go to college. There‘s a bunch of us who are stepping up, but we all understand, you know, the assignment, and that is to bring down prices, period.\" Hunt pointed out that Swalwell did not mention Gov. Gavin Newsom as a potential leader, despite Newsom being considered a possible 2028 presidential candidate. GAVIN NEWSOM DECLARED AS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S 2028 'FRONTRUNNER' BY POLITICO \"Well, he is a show, don‘t tell leader,\" Swalwell said. \"And that‘s why, you know, you‘re seeing also his leadership style being mimicked by others in a good way because some Democratic leaders send eight-page, strongly-worded letters to the president when they don‘t like something. Gavin Newsom goes to the courts and wins to get the troops out of our streets. And he went to the voters and has won to match what Texas did with their redistricting process. That show, not tell style is what people expect right now.\" Swalwell also confirmed to Hunt that his comments were a direct reference to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE The Democratic Party has been searching for new leadership since the 2024 presidential election. Progressive Democrats have increasingly begun turning against current party leaders like Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., over their handling of the government shutdown and the Trump administration. President Donald Trump has repeatedly labeled Crockett as the future of the Democratic Party, while other Republicans have more broadly suggested progressives like New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.

Those pills can kill when taken at the wrong stage of pregnancy, and at least two deaths in the last couple of years has demonstrated those risks. Unfortunately, Behn's position is no longer extreme in the Democrat Party, which has become unhinged in several different ways. \n\nFox News: Iowa Democrat Christina Bohannan has built her campaign for Congress around the image of a hard-working, middle-class advocate who understands what it's like \"to struggle to put food on the table.\" \n\nHowever, her real estate portfolio and financial disclosures paint a very different picture — one of expensive homes, a Florida waterfront condo and lucrative stock investments that place Bohannan among the wealthy elite she claims to want to fight against in Congress. ...\n\nHowever, Bohannan's own financial disclosures and local real estate records paint a picture that clashes with her alleged working-class image. In June, Bohannan purchased University of Iowa basketball coach Fran McCaffery's $1.55 million mansion in Iowa City, while for years she has also owned a waterfront condo inside a gated community in Sarasota, Florida. The gated community sells homes ranging from as little as $300,000 to over $1 million, plus requires thousands in annual homeowner's fees.\n\nMeanwhile, according to Bohannan's financial disclosures, her Sarasota condo has also helped her net as much as $50,000 in rental income annually.\n\nEd: Democrats really love their hardscrabble narratives, but only when promulgated by the landed elite. \n\nPlease spare us the tough-guy act @senmarkkelly. You’re not defending the Constitution — you tried to inject doubt into the ranks of the very people who uphold it. That puts service members at risk, and every veteran I know sees right through it. https://t.co/8BOCvFzmok— Dakota Meyer (@Dakota_Meyer) November 25, 2025\n\nEd: It's sheer demagoguery, and veterans and active-duty members see that most clearly. \n\nFree Beacon: New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's transition team has a new \"community safety\" adviser: Alex Vitale, an outspoken supporter of defunding or abolishing virtually every facet of law enforcement from the local to the federal level, including police, prisons, Border Patrol, ICE, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the FBI, among others.\n\nAlex Vitale is the author of The End of Policing, described as the \"bestselling bible of the movement to defund the police.\" He has panned police officers as \"violence workers\" and \"the natural enemy of the working class.\" He has also called to \"abolish prisons,\" \"abolish the Border Patrol,\" \"Abolish the FBI,\" \"Abolish the DEA,\" \"Abolish the Texas Rangers,\" and implement \"open borders.\"\n\nEd: Both John and David wrote about this today, but allow me to add a few thoughts. Vitale is exactly the kind of appointment we can expect to see in a Democratic Socialist administration in New York City. People seemed to think that Mamdani would moderate his approach after winning his election, but why would he do that? He won on the DSA platform. New York voters will get exactly what they voted for. It's already started. \n\nThis story is completely made up.In fact, when this Fake News published, I was in the Oval Office, where President Trump was meeting with his law enforcement team, including FBI Director Kash Patel.I read the headline to the President and he laughed. He said: “What? That’s… https://t.co/qbsy0nW2Bg pic.twitter.com/aNL5Qw9MA8— Karoline Leavitt (@PressSec) November 25, 2025\n\nI read the headline to the President and he laughed. He said: “What? That’s totally false. Come on Kash, let’s take a picture to show them you’re doing a great job!”Do not believe the Fake News!\n\nEd: The most surprising part of this story is that people took M-SNOW seriously in the first place. The premise alone is silly. To the extent that 'unflattering headlines' might be bothering Trump, it's the Department of Justice that's been creating them, not the FBI. Bondi should be more worried than Patel. \n\nFox 9: FOX 9 has not been able to confirm whether the operation was related to immigration enforcement or simply a criminal investigation. FOX 9 has reached out to St. Paul police, the City of St. Paul, and the Department of Homeland Security for more information on the incident.\n\nAgents at the scene did tell FOX 9's Corin Hoggard they were in the area looking for two people, one of whom ran away and went into a house.\n\nEd: Federal agents have jurisdiction everywhere in the US. They do not need to coordinate with local law enforcement, although they usually do just to make sure no mistakes are made. If they are not coordinating with the mayor or the governor, that may reflect a lack of cooperative spirit from those officials.\n\nWhy would you receive a heads up? Your policies want local law enforcement separated from Federal law enforcement. Why would they bother telling you anything? RESIGN! https://t.co/rG1II5dW9g— Jon Justice (@JonJustice) November 25, 2025\n\nEd: No, Walz is NOT always willing to work with federal law enforcement, especially on immigration. He's just beginning to realize that coordination is a courtesy, not a pre-requisite for operations. Welcome to the Supremacy Clause, Governor JazzHands McSnitchLine. \n\nBarak Ravid at Axios: The meeting between President Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) last week got heated when they discussed the possibility of Saudi Arabia joining the Abraham Accords and normalizing relations with Israel, two U.S. officials and one source with knowledge of the situation told Axios.\n\nWhy it matters: With the war in Gaza over, Trump hoped his meeting with MBS would lead to a breakthrough toward Saudi-Israeli normalization.\n\nBoth praised each other publicly and didn't show any daylight between them, but parts of their closed meeting were tense. Trump was disappointed to hear the pushback from MBS, officials say.\n\nEd: This talk is premature. MBS wants to be the final player in the pact, but he won't act until the Gaza situation is fully resolved. Hamas won't disarm, which means the ceasefire agreement will remain stuck on Phase 1. Israel will have to forcibly disarm Hamas to end the war, and Trump should encourage Israel to get it over with so that the Abraham Accords can proceed. \n\nMatt Walsh tears into “right wing” influencers who pretend they are American while operating from overseas. He spotlights an account called “Israelexposed” which lectured a U.S. citizen about “we should deport you” even though the operator is actually Saudi Arabian.Walsh warns… pic.twitter.com/mEUMOU3fhZ— Open Source Intel (@Osint613) November 25, 2025\n\nWalsh warns that this is part of a coordinated foreign push to infiltrate U.S. politics by posing as American voices and stirring divisions inside the right.He adds that a new narrative is spreading online in which anyone who prioritizes American interests first, and does not fixate on Israel every minute of the day, is suddenly branded as “not America First.”\n\nEd: Elon needs to make location data permanently transparent from now on. It doesn't need precision, but each tweet should have country of origin as well as VPN data attached to it. The brief availability of this data has been quite enlightening. \n\nMediaite: Joy Reid believes Vice President JD Vance has a problem: Because President Donald Trump’s supporters are “fundamentally racist,” that means they “can’t have the successor be the guy with the brown Hindu wife.”\n\nAnd the ex-MSNBC host, during an appearance on Jennifer Welch’s I’ve Had It podcast on Tuesday, also fantasized about a bizarre solution: Vance could ditch his wife, Usha Vance, for Erika Kirk.\n\n“Wouldn’t it be the most perfect MAGA fairytale if he finally sees the light that he needs a white queen, instead of this brown Hindu?” Reid said. “I’m not saying that’s happening, or maybe that Usha’s not even in on it, but that’s one entrant.”\n\nThe idea came to Reid a moment after Welch said Vance had been playing “slap and tickle” with slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s widow. Her comment comes a month after some people on social media said Kirk and Vance had an unusually intimate hug before a Turning Point USA event.\n\nEd: Worst. Fanfic. Ever. What in the world is wrong with Joy Reid, anyway? \n\nErika Kirk says she would have gotten less hate if she touched the back of JD Vance’s ass instead of his head in viral hug photo pic.twitter.com/Xl3sboNyvl— HOT SPOT (@HotSpotHotSpot) November 25, 2025\n\nHuman Events: Human Events has obtained text messages sent by Sen. Reuben Gallego (D-AZ) in which he criticizes members of his own party and mocked the appearance of Democratic men and women. ...\n\nIn the exchange, Gallego responds to encouragement that he could rise within his party amid ongoing political infighting. “Oh man have you met my party? I have been yelling at them this whole time,” he wrote. He would also describe the Democrats as the “not fun party,” accusing them of constantly correcting people and losing the cultural energy they used to project. “We used to be the party of sex, drugs and rock and roll,” he said.\n\nGallego mocked the appearance of Democrats and saying that the men look like women and vice versa writing, “Dem women look like Dem men and Dem men look like women.”\n\nEd: Oh, I don't know. Aftyn Behn looks like she'd be a lot of fun at parties, although getting her to leave one might require several people to accomplish. IYKYK.\n\nThis is the most normal thing a Democrat politician has said in the past decade, but I'm sure it won't be long before he's on his hands and knees apologizing for saying it. https://t.co/r2oTQzCkm8— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 25, 2025\n\nEd: Res ipsa loquitur.\n\nWATCH: NYT host/CNN analyst Lulu Garcia-Navarro gets flustered when @ScottJenningsKY brings up #OperationArcticFrost pic.twitter.com/yxa9Po33Ws— Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) November 25, 2025\n\nEditor's note: If we thought our job in pushing back against the Academia/media/Democrat censorship complex was over with the election, think again.

        "text": "As the extraordinary Oval Office meeting between Donald Trump and Zohran Mamdani shows, there’s a new bellwether in American politics.\n\nFor years, Ohio played that role. In every election from 1964 to 2016, the state voted for the winning presidential candidate, and every four years journalists would travel there to interview voters in Columbus and Cincinnati, Dayton and Youngstown. But in 2020 Biden won without carrying the state, and today Ohio is deeply red, costing it its bellwether status. Several other states once considered battlegrounds – Iowa, Missouri, and Florida – have also turned firmly Republican.\n\nBut now a new bellwether has emerged: Queens. This humble New York borough contains multitudes. With a population of 2.3 million, it would be the nation’s fifth largest city if it stood alone. And in diversity it is without peer. Nearly half of Queens residents are foreign born. It is about a quarter white, a quarter Latino, nearly a quarter Asian and 17% Black, and 140 languages are spoken there. It’s home to Citi Field and the USTA Tennis Center, LaGuardia and John F Kennedy airports, MoMA PS1 and Aqueduct Racetrack, Archie Bunker of All in the Family and Awkwafina of Nora from Queens.\n\nFlushing is home to so many Asians that its downtown is known as the Chinese Times Square. Astoria has one of the largest Greek populations outside of Greece; Jackson Heights is known as “Little Colombia”; Woodside has a “Little Manila”. Jamaica is home to large African American, Caribbean and Central American populations, while Long Island City has become a magnet for the hip and arty. Queens also has New York’s largest Muslim population as well as 150,000 Jews. Overall, it is thoroughly middle and working class – a swath of heartland America set down in pulsating, cosmopolitan New York.\n\nLike all other New York boroughs except Staten Island, Queens reliably votes Democratic, but in November 2024 it moved decisively toward Trump. Where Joe Biden in 2020 won Queens by 72% to 27% – a 45-point margin – Kamala Harris in 2024 won it by only 24 points. Trump’s gains were especially large in heavily Latino, Chinese and south Asian neighborhoods.\n\nMany of those voting for him were propelled by the rise in disorder that had occurred in the wake of the pandemic and then exacerbated by the sudden influx of migrants. The placement of the migrants in makeshift shelters in residential neighborhoods without adequate support services led to a wave of complaints about crime and loitering as well as resentment over the diversion of resources from longtime residents. As in many other districts, the rise in rents and the cost of groceries contributed to a sense among many that the path to the middle class was becoming increasingly narrow. A political realignment seemed under way.\n\nYet even as Trump was making such inroads, the democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was winning 69% of the vote in her congressional district, which straddles northern Queens and the South Bronx. And, as dissatisfaction with the status quo surged and concerns over affordability mounted, support grew for another young insurgent – Zohran Mamdani.\n\nA state assemblyman whose district includes parts of Astoria and Long Island City, Mamdani in the 24 June Democratic primary won support from a mixed salad of leftish young professionals, working-class Latinos, and recently arrived south Asians – all drawn to his bread-and-butter platform of universal childcare, free buses and a rent freeze. Groups like Drum Beats (Desis Rising Up & Moving) canvassed tens of thousands of residents, including a Bangladeshi population that has tripled over the last decade.\n\nIn the general election, Mamdani got 47.3% of the votes in Queens. “Some of the areas that have been trending towards Trump went for Mamdani,” observed John Mollenkopf, a professor of political science at the Cuny Graduate Center.\n\nTrump concurred. “A lot of my voters voted for him,” the president said during his 21 November meeting with Mamdani. The session seemed to seal Queens’s political arrival. For Trump, too, is a product of the borough. He grew up in Jamaica Estates, a leafy upper-middle-class section located about 10 miles from Mamdani’s Astoria home. Both are anti-establishment figures with a knack for understanding and addressing the needs of those with “fingers bruised from lifting boxes on the warehouse floor, palms calloused from delivery by handlebars, [and] knuckles scarred with kitchen burns”, as Mamdani put it in his victory speech.\n\nWith Ocasio-Cortez contemplating a run for higher office, Queens is proving an important seedbed for national politics, and New York-based journalists – rather than have to book flights to the midwest – can now hop on the 7 train to Jackson Heights or Flushing.\n\nYet national news organizations have treated the borough like flyover country. The New York Times in particular has been a step behind. Back in the 90s, the paper had a sizable metro section that thoroughly covered the outer boroughs and the tristate region. But as the Times mushroomed into a global paper – it now has more readers in California than in New York – it has shortchanged the city’s blue-collar precincts. Today, driverless cars in San Francisco get as much coverage in the paper as taxi drivers in Corona.\n\nAs a result, the Times, during the mayoral race, failed to grasp the groundswell developing behind Mamdani. And, when his strength did become evident, it was strangely dismissive and even hostile toward him, sniffing in an editorial that because of his lack of experience and concern about the disorder in the city, “we do not believe that Mr. Mamdani deserves a spot on New Yorkers’ ballots.”\n\nIt followed with an “exposé” about how as a high school senior Mamdani (who was born in Uganda) had checked multiple boxes on his college application to Columbia about his race, purportedly to gain an advantage. Mamdani explained that he considered himself “an American who was born in Africa” and that his answers were an attempt to represent his complex background given the limited choices before him. The piece fed the perception that the Times was “on a crusade against Mamdani”, as Margaret Sullivan put it in the Guardian.\n\nAfter his victory, the paper, noting his ascension and Ocasio-Cortez’s continuing strength, ran a piece about how Queens “is having its moment”. With the borough claiming three of the top four spots in a survey of city-neighborhoods-to-watch in 2025; with Astoria emerging as a favorite among young professionals; and with the Rockaways becoming a summer staple, the Times observed, “Could Queens become the new Brooklyn?”\n\nIt already is the new Ohio.\n\n Michael Massing is an American writer based in New York City.

        "text": "New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani disclosed what happened during his White House meeting with President Donald Trump last week.\n\nThe democratic socialist, when asked about the “weirdest” thing he spotted during the visit in an appearance on “The Adam Friedland Show,” said he was sitting down and waiting for his meeting with the president when he saw “all these different coffee table books” in front of him.\n\n“One of them is ‘UFC at the White House,’” said Mamdani, adding that he had “no idea” about the mixed martial arts event set to take place on the South Lawn in June. “I was just flipping through that.”\n\nMamdani, when asked by Friedland if he saw photos of guys fighting each other in the book, noted that it was just a visualization of what the UFC’s octagon-shaped cage arena would look like on the South Lawn.\n\nThe event — which Trump first teased in July as part of America’s 250th anniversary celebration — is expected to include fighter weigh-ins at the Lincoln Memorial and is scheduled to coincide with the president’s 80th birthday on June 14, 2026.\n\nUFC President and CEO Dana White — in an interview with Fox News in September — revealed that the seating capacity for the event would be around 5,000, citing security concerns. This marks a notable drop from Trump’s initial estimate of up to 25,000 spectators.\n\nWhite, who has endorsed Trump since his 2016 campaign, has also claimed that a park near the White House could host 85,000 people to watch the event on TV screens. He told Sports Business Journal in October that his company would pay $700,000 to replace the White House lawn after the event.\n\nFriedland asked Mamdani whether he was planning to attend the event.\n\n“No,” replied Mamdani with a chuckle.",

        "text": "The late radio host Rush Limbaugh used his 2010 Thanksgiving broadcast to remind listeners of the true story of Thanksgiving.\n\nIt's a lesson that feels especially relevant today, as the Democratic Party is being swallowed whole by radical left-wingers in the Democratic Socialists of America movement, who seek to undermine the nation from within (in what we've coined \"Invisible Insurrection\") and push the country into a socialist hellhole and eventually communism.\n\nIn less than 36 days, Zohran Mamdani will become the next mayor of New York City, ushering in a radical strain of the Democratic Party that blends Marxism and Islamism - a combination that does not align with Western values.\n\nMore broadly, the rudderless Democratic Party has been hijacked by radical DSA, who prioritize Marxist ideology and illegal aliens over capitalism and native-born Americans.\n\nIt's a deeply troubling trajectory for the party of unhinged purple-haired liberal-educated people that refuses to learn from history as it aims to push policies that undermine private property, restrict freedoms, and expand state-run economics and central planning - models that have epically failed around the world.\n\nJust look at the catastrophic collapses of Venezuela, Cuba, North Korea, and countless others, and these collapses have led to death and mass starvation. Yet, America's liberal college industrial complex continues to brainwash kids into a flawed way of toxic thinking. \n\nBack to Limbaugh's 2010 Thanksgiving broadcast. In short, he says the traditional Thanksgiving narrative celebrates cooperation and Native-American generosity. However, the early years of Plymouth Colony underscore how incentives, property rights, and institutional design shaped survival and laid the groundwork for the later celebration in the American founding.\n\nPilgrims tried socialism when they first landed—no private property, everything held in common. They nearly starved to death. Bradford’s introduction of capitalism and property rights saved the colony.\nEthnic and religious homogeneity didn’t save them. Freedom and ownership did. pic.twitter.com/RvoDwWOjuk\n— Joel Berry (@JoelWBerry) August 4, 2025\n\nIn other words, the Plymouth Colony tried the communal property system and miserably failed. Once private-property incentives were unlocked, they enabled productivity, self-sufficiency, and flourishing in a free society. \n\nPerhaps Limbaugh's Plymouth Colony story should serve as yet another reminder to Democrats who refuse to learn from history simply because they've persuaded themselves that this time will be different. \n\nThe Pilgrims tried socialism.\nIt nearly killed the colony\nWhen Bradford restored private property, abundance returned.\nSocialism fails because it denies human nature and God’s design. @RHelfenbein pic.twitter.com/hiFq3KNFYB\n— Standing for Freedom Center (@freedomcenterlu) November 25, 2025\n\nIt would be a great story to tell the unhinged, triple-vaxxed liberal aunt at Thanksgiving.",

        "text": "Across the political spectrum, with alarm on the right and delight on the left, the display of warmth from Donald Trump toward Zohran Mamdani on Friday set off shock waves. The president’s lavish praise of the New York City mayor-elect in the Oval Office was a 180-degree turn from his condemnation of the democratic socialist as “a pure true communist” and “a total nut job.” The stunning reversal made for a great political drama. But what does it portend? \n\nTrump and his MAGA followers are hardly going to forsake their standard mix of bigotry, anti-immigrant mania and other political toxins. Demagoguery has long fueled the Republican engine — and in the 11 months until the midterm elections, skullduggery to thwart democracy promises to accelerate rather than slow down.\n\nWhile countless media outlets have marveled at the appearance of a sudden Trump-Mamdani “bromance,” the spectacle has rekindled hopes that America can become less polarized and find more common ground. But what kind of common ground can — or should — be found with the leader of today’s fascistic GOP? \n\nIt’s true that Mamdani has a huge stake in diverting the Trump bull from goring New York. Billions of dollars are at stake in federal aid to the city, and New York would be thrown into a chaotic crisis if the president were to make good on his threats to send in federal troops. Mamdani seems to have deftly prevented such repressive actions against his city, at least for a while.\n\nUnderstandably, the mayor-elect’s main concern is his upcoming responsibility for New York and its 8.5 million residents. But as important as the Big Apple is, Trump’s draconian and dictatorial orders nationwide are also at stake. It’s unclear that the chemistry between the two leaders will do anything at all to help protect immigrants in Chicago, Charlotte, Portland, Los Angeles — or anywhere else in the country.\n\nThe president’s accolades for a leftist certainly confounded the perennial left-bashers at Fox News and many other right-wing outlets, and such discombobulation among pro-MAGA media operatives has been a pleasure to behold. But there’s more than a wisp of wishful thinking in the air from progressives eager to believe that Trump’s effusive statements about Mamdani, an avowed socialist, will help to legitimize socialism for the American public.\n\nTrump’s turnaround might cause some Americans to reconsider their anti-left reflexes. But it’s also plausible that ripple effects of the episode could help to legitimize, in some people’s eyes, the president’s leadership even while it continues to inflict horrific policies and anti-democratic politics on the country. Gracious and avuncular performances by despots are nothing new, as when Trump hosted Bill Maher at the White House last spring and the comedian returned the favor by proclaiming that the president had been “gracious and measured.” Neither are cosmetics on the face of a fascist.\n\nA hazard is that the image of Trump as a tolerant, open-minded president, in convivial discourse with New York’s progressive leader, could undercut the solid accusations that Trump is imposing tyrannical policies on America. Just a day before he met with Mamdani, the president seemed to suggest executing several congressional Democrats who filmed a video reminding U.S. military personnel of their duty to not obey illegal orders.\n\nWant more sharp takes on politics? Sign up for our free newsletter, Standing Room Only, written by Amanda Marcotte, now also a weekly show on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nThe most publicized few seconds of the public portion of Trump and Mamdani’s meeting came when a journalist asked about the mayor-elect’s past charge that the president is a fascist. The exchange was widely reported as an amusing moment, as Trump quipped that Mamdani should just say yes and affirm that the president is a fascist.\n\nBut the danger of normalizing autocracy is heightened when the utterly serious appraisal of Trump as a fascist can be recast as a media punchline.\n\nOver the weekend, Mamdani stood his ground during an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” He pointed out that he had replied “yes” to the reporter’s question about Trump being a fascist. “Everything that I’ve said in the past, I continue to believe,” he added. \n\nHow long Mamdani will remain in Trump’s good graces is anyone’s guess. No doubt the mayor-elect is fully aware that the president could turn on him with a vengeance. If Trump can do that to one of his most loyal ideological fighters, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, he can certainly do it to Mamdani.\n\nTo call Trump “mercurial” is a vast understatement. And yet, in countless ways, with his rhetoric and with the power of the presidency, he has been unwavering and consistent — as immigrants being terrorized by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and single mothers trying to feed their families know all too well. Given all the harm his policies are doing every minute, it would be unwise to take seriously Trump’s broken-clock pronouncements that are occasionally accurate and decent.\n\nDemocratic socialists don’t need Trump’s approval. We need to defeat his MAGA agenda and movement. Right now, it’s unclear whether what happened with him and Mamdani in the Oval Office will make that defeat any more likely.\n\nMamdani and Trump found each other newly useful last Friday. Only later will we know who was more effectively using whom.\n\nWhile it’s all well and good to laud Mamdani’s extraordinary political talents and inspiring leadership for social justice, at the same time we should recognize that he has entered into an embrace with a rattlesnake. Even when it purrs, it’s still a rattlesnake.",

        "text": "In the wake of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s victory in New York City, it’s hard to be optimistic about America’s young voters. An Axios poll released days before the mayoral election found that a concerning 67% of U.S. college students have either a positive or neutral association with the word “socialism.” And it appears they have an even greater appreciation for the word “Zohran,” as roughly three-fourths of voters under 30 cast their ballots for the anti-capitalist who promised them government-run grocery stores.\n\nWhile these numbers are depressing for those of us who don’t want to see American supermarket shelves resemble those in Venezuela, the data alone might be explained away as part of a natural political development cycle—a youthful naïveté that will eventually give way to a more mature conservatism. As the famous saying goes, “If you are young and not liberal, then you have no heart; but if you are old and not conservative, then you have no brain.” \n\nBut liberalism is not socialism, and what if their young minds are being permanently damaged by dangerous TikTok algorithms and the brainwashing of anti-American teachers?\n\nIt’s hard to avoid that conclusion after watching TikTok reactions to Mamdani’s win in this compilation video released by Ben Shapiro:\n\nThe second young woman featured in the video makes the dubious claim that American schools actually do teach that socialism is bad (which schools is she talking about so I can enroll my kids ASAP?). Even if they were teaching kids not to hate capitalism (they’re not), this woman makes it clear they’re doing a terrible job.\n\nI think the vast majority of Americans do not understand socialism whatsoever. You have been bred throughout our entire education to believe that socialism is this evil, bad, big-government dictatorship thing. When, in reality, a simple Google search would literally prove that wrong. Socialism is simply just a concept that the good of the people, as a collective, is prioritized by the government over private ownership and private wealth.\n\nShe, of course, favors the Democratic Socialists of America-approved \"C\" word — collective — over \"capitalism.\" As the DSA website explains: \"We want to collectively own the key economic drivers that dominate our lives, such as energy production and transportation.\" \n\nWhy is this type of message so appealing to young voters? Paul Mueller, in a warning about a \"wave of radical socialist sentiment,\" writes in Law & Liberty:\n\nCollectivism is a kind of \"political junk food\" that people crave in periods when they are particularly hungry for community and solidarity. Collectivism means socializing things through force, rather than through voluntary community. Collectivism demands forced redistribution of wealth and uses this or that version of the “common” interest to undermine individual ownership, choice, and rights.\n\nThis political outlook is particularly devastating for young people, as Mueller explains:\n\nConsider again the young college graduates who drove Mamdani’s radical candidacy to electoral success. They engaged, for a time, in political advocacy. But what do they do after the sugar rush fades? Do they return to building their families? Most are not married, and those who are likely don’t have children. Do they return to building up their churches, synagogues, or mosques? Most are not part of these institutions. We can be forgiven for wondering whether they engage in real civic associations at all.\n\nSpeaking of families, the first young woman in the video advises on how to talk to family members who say Mamdani is a socialist. This is advice that many young liberals will surely be following this Thanksgiving:\n\nIf you encounter someone who tries to tell you he is a socialist, like, let's say, your boomer parents, this is what you need to explain to them. Mamdani is not a socialist. He’s a democratic socialist. Socialist countries are like North Korea and Cuba. You know what Mamdani is? A democratic socialist.\n\nOf course, Mamdani has flat-out said he doesn't like capitalism. Not even Pedro Sánchez, the prime minister of Spain and member of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (emphasis added), would say that out loud. I've written before about the similarities between Mamdani and Sanchez: They're both self-proclaimed feminists who hate Israel about as much as they love high taxes, and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party advocates for \"social democracy\" just as Mamdani's DSA does.\n\nHow’s that working out for young people in Spain? The youth unemployment rate is about 25%, one of the highest in Europe, and about that many — 1 in 4 20-to-40-year-olds — still live at home. \n\nNow for the good news: Young Spaniards are increasingly realizing that the radical left’s policies are failing to improve their lives, with a growing number turning to the conservative, populist Vox party. A recent poll found that 27.9% of 18- to 24-year-olds, and 26% of 25-to-34-year-olds, plan to cast their ballot for Vox at the next election. The Economist reports, \"Among Spanish men aged under 25 Vox is now the leading party, and among males under 45 it enjoys more support than the mainstream conservative People’s Party.\"\n\nJust as Mamdani calls Trump a fascist, the mainstream media and the political establishment attempt to dismiss Vox by labeling it far-right, even as it represents the values and concerns of ordinary Spaniards. \n\nHere’s a video featuring young people explaining why they support Vox. They sound a little wiser than the TikTokers above.\n\nOne young Spaniard says of Vox leader Santiago Abascal, \"I think he’s the future president of Spain, and the only salvation we have for this country.\"\n\nHis friend says, \"Yes, the truth is that what we have now is terrible. I mean, this has to come out because if not, we’re going to end up like underdeveloped countries. And this can’t happen.\"\n\nAnother young man puts the lie to the claim that Vox is the continuation of former Spanish dictator Francisco Franco: \"There is a lot of talk about the right being pro-Franco. And I have to stay that Franco died in 1975. Francoism no longer exists. So to portray a right-wing party as pro-Franco is absurd.\"\n\nFinally, another young man expresses his exasperation with a political class that isn’t responding to people’s needs: \"Honestly, [we need] someone who is going to save us from the government we have right now because it’s the only option we have left because they constantly lie to us with everything the government says like [about] the housing [crisis].\"\n\nMaybe \"crazy\" boomer parents should arm themselves with this video at the Thanksgiving dinner table to counter the claims of their pro-Mamdani socialist kids.\n\nBefore you go, a quick heads-up: for Black Friday, you can join PJ Media VIP for 60% off with the promo code FIGHT.\n\nAnd here’s the big twist this year — anyone who signs up for VIP Platinum during this sale is automatically entered to win one of five lifetime Platinum memberships.

        "text": "We are told this was merely a protest. We are urged to contextualize. To soften. To relativize. To move along.\n\nOn the evening of November 19, 2025, Park East Synagogue in Manhattan became the target of organized intimidation that included more than 200 “protesters” there to terrify Jews as they exited their house of worship. What unfolded fits not the language of dissent but the architecture of coercion, and worse—terrorism. A megaphone directive, held by one of the leaders, rang out to the mob with disturbing clarity: “We need to make them scared. We need to make them scared. We need to make them scared.” \n\nThe mob chanted back with undeniable bloodlust:\n\n “From New York to Gaza, globalize the Intifada!” “Resistance, you make us proud, take another settler out!”“Death to the IDF!”“Intifada revolution … There is only one solution: Intifada revolution.”\n\nThe strategy was explicit. The goal was fear. It was driven by hate. \n\nThis was not protected speech in its pure constitutional sense. This was speech aimed at menacing, threatening, and disrupting religious exercise — conduct squarely addressed by both New York State and federal law.\n\nNew York Penal Law § 240.21 (Aggravated Harassment in the First Degree) criminalizes communication intended to harass, annoy, threaten, or alarm another person based on race or religion when it places that person in reasonable fear.\n\nNew York Penal Law § 240.30 further expands harassment statutes to cover acts that seriously annoy or alarm another person with no legitimate purpose.\n\nMore pointedly, the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE Act), 18 U.S.C. § 248, explicitly protects individuals exercising religious freedom from intimidation, threat, or force. Houses of worship fall into this protective framework where access is obstructed or worshippers are threatened.\n\nAdd to this the constitutional bedrock of the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause, reinforced by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (42 U.S.C. § 2000bb), and the legal clarity becomes unavoidable: Jews leaving a synagogue are not legitimate targets for political theater — and the state has a duty to defend them.\n\nAnd yet, law enforcement was inadequate. The laws sat dormant. The moment passed without the urgency it demanded.\n\nWhat filled the vacuum was not leadership. It was Mamdani.\n\nZohran Mamdani’s response was not a rebuke of intimidation but a reframing of Jewish heritage itself as suspect. His language suggested that Jewish gathering space must be scrutinized, contextualized, justified — as if its legitimacy must be granted by an ideological authority. He cast the synagogue event as a “misuse of sacred space” rather than standing unequivocally between worshippers and those who sought to frighten them.\n\nThis is not mere political spin. It is a pattern. It’s also foreshadowing. \n\nMamdani emerges here not as mediator but as provocateur — a political figure who stokes division through moral inversion: recasting victims as instigators, redefining safety as privilege, and suspicion as justice. It is ideological governance masquerading as compassion.\n\nAnd this is where the deeper pattern reveals itself.\n\nThe philosophy underpinning this response bears the unmistakable imprint of Communism: where individual rights bow to ideological conformity and where identity groups are permitted safety only when aligned with the ruling narrative.\n\nIn Mamdani’s New York City, sacred space will no longer sacred — it is conditional.\n\nSpeech will no longer be free — it will be filtered through political utility.\n\nCitizenship will no longer be equal — it will be tiered according to ideological compliance.\n\nThis is not a theoretical abstraction. It is how societies slide.\n\nSo the question before New York is not merely electoral. It is civilizational.\n\nWhat will New York City look like for Jews under Mamdani’s leadership?\n\nFor Christians?\n\nFor American patriots who believe loyalty to this nation should not require suppression of conscience?\n\nWhat kind of city is forged when leadership treats faith and heritage as suspect and intimidation as contextual? When the right to worship, practice tradition or express identity must be negotiated through ideological framing rather than protected by law?\n\nAre we crafting a tomorrow that future generations will examine in remorse — asking how we allowed intimidation to be normalized, how democratic pluralism yielded to ideological rigidity, how fear replaced freedom?\n\nHistory has a pattern, and it is unforgiving to those who ignore it. It records not only the acts of aggressors, but the silence of those who rationalized them.\n\nWe will not be distracted.\n\nNot by bureaucratic sleight-of-hand.\n\nNot by media deflection.\n\nNot by rhetorical softening of antisemitism into “activism.”\n\nA synagogue was besieged.\n\nThe law was sidelined.\n\nAnd leadership failed.\n\nThe question now is not whether Zohran Mamdani will impose his ideology upon us. The question is whether we will listen — and whether we will remember which path leads to freedom, and which leads quietly to the wrong side of history.",

        "text": "When some families play Monopoly, they put any taxes or fines paid by players into the middle of the board. Land on Free Parking, and you win that pot of money.\n\nThe problem is that this breaks the game.\n\nThe whole point of Monopoly, of course, is to force other players into bankruptcy. That’s how you win. But as hundreds of dollars get randomly redistributed, players who were down on their luck are suddenly flush with cash, prolonging an already interminable game.\n\nSomething like this has happened to our presidential primaries. Once governed by a set of rules designed to produce a nominee by rough consensus, primary fields have been warped by successive changes to how the game is played that have led to a system practically guaranteed to produce chaos instead of a clear winner.\n\nAt some point, the primary field has to be winnowed.\n\nNow, some Democrats are discussing a rule change that would fix a couple of these issues at once, even if it didn't solve everything. But before we get into how it would work, let’s talk about the problem.\n\nIn both the Democratic and Republican primaries, there are simply too many candidates. In 2016, at least 17 major candidates ran for the Republican presidential nomination. In 2020, at least 29 candidates sought the Democratic nomination. It’s still early but the 2028 Democratic field is already looking like it could be similarly crowded.\n\nThere are various reasons why so many campaigns get underway — most prominent among them less centralized political parties and campaign finance laws that allow weak candidates who have a couple of deep-pocketed donors to run in an overly long pre-election season (which starts a full year before anyone actually walks into a voting booth).\n\nTo be fair, it’s not necessarily a bad thing that so many people want to be president. Go ahead, kid, shoot your shot.\n\nAt some point, though, the field has to be winnowed. On the Republican side, the system favors whoever wins the most votes in a given primary, even if that candidate didn’t get a majority. That’s how the GOP in 2016 ended up with Trump, who pulled off plurality wins in the beginning of the primary season until he was unstoppable, even as the majority of voters favored someone else.\n\nOn the Democratic side, the party has long used an elaborate system of awarding delegates proportionally, with overly complicated rules that make “The Cones of Dunshire” board game on “Parks and Recreation” look like Go Fish. The effect is that this drags out the primary process (see: Hillary Clinton vs. Barack Obama in 2008 and Hillary Clinton vs. Bernie Sanders in 2016). It can lead to warring factions with such goofy names as PUMAs and Bernie Bros, undermining party unity.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopefuls participate in the fourth Democratic primary debate of the 2020 presidential campaign on Oct. 15, 2019, in Westerville, OHio.\n\nThe solution that was reported on this week, which Democrats such as Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, and pollster Celinda Lake are proposing, is called ranked-choice voting. Instead of picking just one candidate out of the field, voters can rank candidates in order of their preference, typically up to five. If no one gets a majority, the lowest-ranked candidate is eliminated, and the second-choice votes of everyone who backed them are then redistributed. This goes on in successive rounds until one candidate secures a majority.\n\nThis may sound complicated, but it’s not that different from a runoff, which many states use if no candidate wins a majority. The difference is that you don’t have to go back and vote again; you just rank them all in one go.\n\nRanked-choice voting isn’t a radical new idea. It’s been used in national elections in Australia since 1919. Closer to home, it is used in races for mayor and city council in progressive enclaves such as as San Francisco and Cambridge, Massachusetts. Two states — Maine and Alaska — use it for statewide elections, but the most high-profile recent example came in New York City’s mayoral primary, in which Zohran Mamdani rose to the top of a 10-person field. (Hollywood also approves: Ranked-choice voting has been used by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to determine the Best Picture winner since 2009.)\n\nRanked-choice voting would solve two big problems facing Democrats.\n\nFirst, it allows voters to have their say without elaborate head games over “wasting” their vote. You want to vote for that candidate with whom you really agree the most? Rank them first. Then put the more “electable” candidate as your second pick. Is there someone — say, a disgraced former governor — you really don’t want to win? Rank everyone but that candidate.\n\nRanked-choice voting would solve two big problems facing Democrats.\n\nSecond, it encourages candidates to play nice. In a ranked-choice election, the key to winning isn’t just picking up first-choice votes, but also getting a good number of second- and third-choice votes. That discourages negative advertising and encourages candidates to form mutually beneficial alliances. Research has found that voters think ranked-choice elections are less negative.\n\nThere are some problems with ranked-choice voting, including what political scientists call “ballot exhaustion,” which happens when voters burn out from ranking so many races or simply don’t know enough about all the candidates. But that isn’t a problem in a high-profile presidential primary. Voters have months to learn about different candidates and hear them debate the issues in depth.\n\nRepublicans could benefit from the same system, but they’ve come out against it, arguing that it’s too confusing, leads to wasted votes and slows down results. (They also argue that it would reduce the influence of the major political parties, which may be their core objection.) Not only has the Republican National Committee passed a resolution opposing it, but several Republican-run states have banned cities from experimenting with it.\n\nThat should give Democrats another reason to support this approach. They have a chance to create a presidential primary system that would encourage their candidates to run broader, more inclusive campaigns and avoid negative campaigning; help the party settle on a nominee relatively quickly without in-fighting; and allow voters to feel like their voices were heard.\n\nThat would put their eventual nominee in a much better position for the general election, particularly against a Republican who won after running in the current, flawed system.",

        "text": "New York City progressives were dealt a blow on Wednesday, just weeks after Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s landmark victory, as a more moderate Democrat announced she has enough support to become the next City Council speaker.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Mamdani’s team for comment via email.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nMamdani’s victory was a major win for progressives. Earlier in November, he defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa to become the leader of the nation’s largest city. But his ability to push his agenda through hinges on a cooperative city council. More moderate Democrats and Republicans on the council could block his policies, including free bus services and city-run grocery stores.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nCouncil Member Julie Menin, a Democrat who represents the Upper East Side, announced that she has garnered enough support to become its next speaker. If this holds, she would defeat Council Member Crystal Hudson, a progressive seen as more in line with Mamdani.\n\nMenin said she would have support from at least 36 current and incoming members of the New York City Council across all five boroughs. Her coalition includes many Democrats, as well as a handful of Republicans who serve on the committee.\n\nCouncil Member Joann Ariola is among the Republicans supporting Menin.\n\nNew York City Council Member Julie Menin speaks in New York City on June 28, 2022.\n\n“She has spent her entire career delivering for the people of New York. She’s been a business owner, a nonprofit leader, a commissioner, and a Council Member, and at every step she’s shown that she can cut through the red tape of city bureaucracy and produce real results. Her depth of experience and her proven record of leadership make her exactly the Speaker the Council needs right now,” Ariola wrote on X.\n\nThe New York Times reported that some members viewed Menin as a “check” on Mamdani, who will take office in January 2026. She told the Times she believes she plans to have a “close and collaborative relationship with the administration.”\n\nWhile she is viewed as a potential foil to Mamdani, Menin did congratulate him on his victory earlier in November. She wrote on X that she was “excited” to collaborate with him on “an agenda that meets the challenges of this moment and withstands the threats we face from a Trump-led Washington.”\n\nShe also praised his messaging on the affordability of child care and housing, saying it is a “vision I share.”\n\nMore progressive City Council members, including those affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), of which Mamdani is a member, did not endorse Menin for speaker.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nDemocratic pollster Adam Carlson wrote on X: “God we need Speaker Crystal Hudson so badly. Julie Menin would just spend most of the time trying to being a foil to Mamdani to set up a 2029 mayoral run.”\n\nNew York City Council Member Kamillah M. Hanks wrote on X: “Julie has the vision to move our City forward and the knowledge and tenacity to get things done! I am proud to support @JulieMenin to lead the NYC Council as our next Speaker!”\n\nJeff Coltin, a reporter for Politico, wrote on X: “Julie Menin is miles apart from Zohran Mamdani’s political base on an identity level, but politically, it’s not as clear cut. She was trusted by de Blasio, close with labor unions and is quick to remind you she was the one that gave Ossé’s broker fee bill a hearing and a vote.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nMamdani will take office in January. The New York City Council will also meet in January, when new members take office.",

The officers then realized the men were ICE officers. \n\nIn his letter, Goldman inquired about the protocol in place for NYPD officers to respond to federal law enforcement: “Has your Department issued guidance or protocol to officers advising them how to respond to federal agents operating without visible identifiers or markings during enforcement operations or actions? If so, please provide such guidance.”\n\nThe congressman also expressed his concerns over the agent’s failure to identify themselves as being with ICE. “Has your Department raised concerns related to public safety stemming from federal officials failing to identify themselves directly to the Department of Homeland Security? If so, please provide details about your concerns and any response you received,” he wrote.\n\nThe letter is under review by the department, NYPD Executive Director of Communications Brad Weeks stated. \n\nGoldman’s letter follows his previous remarks on the city’s sanctuary city laws, in which he stated that the Mamdani administration must alter the city statute to allow local law enforcement to intervene in the operations of federal agents that violate local law. \n\n“The most important thing is for the NYPD to change its approach,” Goldman said on Oct. 21, adding that the NYPD should be allowed to “intervene to protect New Yorkers from the lawlessness that ICE is repeatedly and consistently demonstrating as part of [President] Donald Trump’s fascist immigration dragnet.” \n\nTRUMP’S WARM EMBRACE OF MAMDANI COMPLICATES 2026 GOP MESSAGING\n\nGoldman made his remarks in a letter to Tisch a day earlier, asking the city to “strictly enforce” the law against lawbreaking federal agents. \n\n“I write to request that the New York City Police Department (NYPD or Department) be prepared to strictly enforce state and local laws in order to hold federal agents accountable for any unlawful actions they engage in, including potentially through arrest and prosecution for felony violations,” he wrote.",

        "text": "Artificial intelligence is currently leading the pack in the race for TIME's 2025 Person of the Year, holding a 36% chance, according to Polymarket.\n\nFollowing AI are NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang at 24%, Pope Leo XIV at 15%, and former President Donald Trump at 7%. Elon Musk trails with just a 2% chance, despite his previous high-profile public influence.\n\nOther notable names include Sam Altman at 6% and Zohran Mamdani at 3%.\n\nThe leading candidates show that it's not just humans shaping global influence; it can also be technology.\n\nCan AI Truly Be TIME's Person of the Year?\n\nInterestingly, TIME magazine has historically named both individuals and abstract concepts as Person of the Year, like 'The Computer' in 1982.\n\nThe concept of AI being chosen may continue this tradition, especially since TIME has been recognising that ideas can also influence society, like how AI impacts all industries today.\n\nAlthough AI cannot accept the award itself, the recognition would be symbolic.\n\nWhy AI Has the Best Odds\n\nPrediction markets suggest AI is ahead for several reasons.\n\nEven Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA, has seen 24% odds due to his role in advancing AI hardware and software. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, also benefits indirectly from AI.\n\nInvestors and market watchers see AI as both a transformative tool and a cultural phenomenon, capable of changing how people work, communicate, and create. The betting volumes, $808,092 (£658,000) for AI alone, far surpass those for other candidates, indicating strong public interest and perceived likelihood of the selection.\n\nHow TIME Chooses Its Person of the Year\n\nTIME evaluates candidates based on their influence over the past year, not necessarily whether that influence is positive. Editors consider public engagement, news coverage, and historical significance.\n\nBesides the usual human figures, TIME has sometimes recognized non-human entities, showing that influence is the main factor. AI's influence and use in healthcare, finance, art, and communications make it a suitable candidate by these standards.\n\nPublic polls, social media attention, and economic indicators also play a role in the editorial decision, even if the final selection rests with TIME's editorial board.\n\nRecords for TIME Covers\n\nWhile AI may top the 2025 odds, cultural influence continues to play a major role in TIME's visibility.\n\nTaylor Swift, with less than 1% odds this year, holds the record for the best-selling Time Person of the Year issue of all time. Her 2023 cover sold more copies than any other issue in over a decade.\n\nMeanwhile, former US President Richard Nixon has appeared on Time's cover more than anyone else, with 55 appearances from 1952 to 1994.\n\nThese records show that while AI may be at the forefront this year, celebrity and human achievement are still key to the magazine's cultural impact.\n\nWhen Will TIME Announce The 2025 Person of the Year?\n\nThe announcement of TIME's 2025 Person of the Year is expected at the end of December. Whether AI wins the title or a human candidate takes it, the list shows different people in their own industry who have been made a public focus over the impressions they have left.\n\nFor now, the attention is on artificial intelligence, which has a 36% chance, making it the most watched contender in the magazine's long history of annual selections.\n\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK",

Would you like to see a democratic socialist candidate win the 2028 presidential election?”\n\nAcross the board, 51 percent said “yes,” they would like to see a democratic socialist win the 2028 presidential election. Only 32 percent said “no,” and 17 percent remain unsure.\n\nPredictably, opinions are sharply divided on party lines. Eighty-two percent of Democrats under 40 said they would like to see a democratic socialist win the 2028 presidential election, compared to eight percent who said no and nine percent who remain unsure.\n\nOn the flip side, 65 percent of Republicans under 40 said they do not want to see that, compared to 24 percent who do and 11 percent who remain unsure.\n\nIndependents are pretty divided, as 37 percent said they would like a democratic socialist to win the 2028 presidential election, followed by 32 percent who remain unsure and 31 percent who said no.\n\nWhen asked who has influenced them the most to support democratic socialism, over a quarter of respondents, 27 percent, said it was a parent, followed by 17 percent who said online videos or podcasts, ten percent who said books, and seven percent who said a grandparent. Six percent attributed that support to print or digital news publications, five percent to television shows, five percent to a church leader, and four percent to a teacher in college or high school.\n\nA plurality of Democrats and Republicans who support democratic socialism attributed the influence to their parents, while the highest percentage of independents, 18 percent, said books.\n\nThe survey of 1,496 U.S. likely voters between the ages of 18-39 was conducted on October 31-November 2, 2025, and it has a margin of error of +/- 3 percent.\n\nThe survey follows the rise of Muslim socialist Zohran Mamdani, the mayor-elect in New York City, who has pushed radial ideas including city-owned grocery stores. He has also suggested that “mental health experts” should respond to crimes rather than police.\n\nIt also comes as Democrat infighting becomes more prominent as seen during the Democrat government shutdown, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) trying to appease the far-left base of his party.",

        "text": "When it comes to talking to Gen Z men the right is beginning to sound a bit like the left: You can’t get ahead. The whole world is stacked against you. You’re the real victim here.\n\nPodcaster Ben Shapiro recently said as much at a recent event, when he called out conservatives for inculcating young men with a “nihilistic” worldview rather than giving them the “tough talk” they need.\n\n“I think that the right is actually weirdly feminizing young men by giving them a victimology to buy into,” Shapiro said at the Jewish Leadership Conference. “This notion that you, as a Gen Z male, are facing these obstacles that no other human has faced for all of human history, like, read a book for once! Like seriously, go talk to your grandfather.”\n\nYoung conservative men are being told that it’s impossible to get a house, a girlfriend, a job, even get off their phones. Yes, these might be real challenges, but politicians insisting life is nothing but an uphill battle is toxic.\n\nThis is the sort of victim complex conservatives recently accused the left of promoting. What happened to the “pull yourself up by the bootstraps” party?\n\nSpeaking in New York City on November 16, Shapiro acknowledged that young people have been failed by a “political class that lies to them.” But he also worried they’re being robbed of agency.\n\n“Maybe this is just the nature of politics, which is that politicians have a stake in telling you that you have unsolvable problems that only they can solve if you give them enough power,” he said. “But the problem is, if you say that to young men and you remove the agency from them, they get angry and they don’t know what to do with that anger.”\n\nYoung conservatives have been assaulted with reasons that they can’t get ahead. When politicians and influencers have your ear via screens 24/7, their doomerism can make the world’s problems feel insurmountable — and make you feel very, very small.\n\nYes, free speech on campus has been a massive problem particularly for conservatives, but you can still be bold and put yourself out there. And you will survive. Yes, it’s true that DEI and identity politics got out of hand, but white America isn’t under siege.\n\nYes, illegal immigration has been out of control, but there isn’t a conspiracy to replace you. Yes, the war on toxic masculinity went too far, but that doesn’t preclude young men from aspiring to find a healthy expression of their own manhood.\n\nYes, feminism sometimes goes a bit overboard, but that doesn’t mean all women suck and you’ll never find a suitable mate. Yes, your phone is full of flashy, addictive algorithmic sirens luring you in, but it’s also within your power to put it away.\n\nYes, the economy is uncertain, but you have your whole life ahead of you to find your path. \n\nThe right is teaching young conservatives to think that they have no control over the outside forces acting upon them. They’re taking a page straight out of the left’s playbook — so much so that Donald Trump seems to have taken a liking to Zohran Mamdani, the king of victimology.\n\nThe core message of the conservative movement used to be “you have agency.” This is the party of Ronald Reagan, who said in his 1967 Inaugural Address as Governor of California, “There is no humanity or charity in destroying self-reliance, and dignity and self-respect, the very substance of moral fiber.”\n\nUnfortunately, the right is starting to destroy the self-reliance of young people, insisting that the “elites” and the older generation are screwing them over — and playing straight into the hand of cranks like edge-lord podcaster Nick Fuentes who are eager to capitalize on misery.\n\n“The older generations have completely betrayed and sold out the youth,” Fuentes wrote on X earlier this month. “They have left us a ‘diversified’ s—t hole filled with foreigners, dominated by the Left, controlled by global special interests. And when young men stand up to fight, they scold us for being too edgy online.”\n\nIt’s not clear how Fuentes is materially standing up, other than fomenting hatred and taking his anger about his own life out on other groups of people. This is exactly what J.D. Vance warned against in his 2016 memoir “Hillbilly Elegy.”\n\n“The message of the right is increasingly: It’s not your fault if you’re a loser; it’s the government’s fault,” Vance wrote disapprovingly.\n\nTelling young people that you can fix their intractable problems is a clear path to votes. But robbing a generation of agency is a shortsighted route to societal stagnation.\n\nIt’s time to turn the message around. Shapiro, for his part, suggested the right should start delivering a new line: “You should actually pick your ass up and go out and do something useful.” He’s spot on.",

(Read about the Red–Green alliance).\n\nAnd now, just like that other capital of the Anglosphere, London, New York has a Muslim mayor who is, in this case, an advocate of radical Shia Islam.

The visit drew much discussion from media personalities, as Mamdani and Trump have continuously shared their disdain for the other.\n\nIn addition, Mamdani opened up about how he started to gain attention from Americans during his October 2024 campaign, which he partly credited Trump for. During the early months of his campaign, he started interviewing Trump voters about why they voted for him after Trump was elected.\n\n“It just went back to cost of living and it went back to cheaper groceries, and that was a lot of our campaign,” Mamdani said of the responses.\n\nEarlier in the conversation, Mamdani also detailed what it was like visiting Trump, sharing that he was welcomed with a tour of White House’s Oval Office and the Cabinet Room, among other areas. \n\n“He showed me the portraits of all the presidents in the Cabinet Room,” Mamdani said. “The FDR (Franklin D. Roosevelt) was beautiful, and we talked about FDR for a little bit. And honestly, you don’t have the LaGuardia record if you don’t have FDR.”\n\nHe went on to say that while he was waiting for their official press meeting, he spotted an interesting piece of literature on one of the coffee tables. \n\n“In front of me are all these different coffee table books, and one of them is ‘UFC at the White House,’” Mamdani explained, who said he was unaware of the president’s plan to bring UFC fights to the White House, but he indulged nonetheless. “I had no idea, but I was flipping through that.”\n\nMamdani said that he has no plans to attend the potential event.",

        "text": "WORTHINGTON — The holidays are all about coming together with family and close friends, right? But what if this was turned on its head — what if it was about eating beside complete strangers?\n\nThis is exactly the goal that Gabriel Unger had in mind as he hosted a Friendsgiving celebration Monday night for the fourth year in a row in his expansive dance studio with raftered ceilings. Some 125 community members pitched in dishes and came bearing booze for the potluck event that was focused on separating from your spouse and family to make new friends and connections.\n\n“One thing that we really encourage is that everyone make a point to try and meet some people you haven’t met before. Say hello to people you haven’t met before and don’t be shy,” said Unger, as he invited people up to eat. “Just for this evening — you can live your life differently when you’re not here.”\n\nCommunity members understood the assignment.\n\nLevi Gershowitz of Plainfield was huddled in conversation with a Worthington couple, Kyle Dempsey and Ally Brown. From the outside they looked like friends of a decade or more, but in reality, “I just met them,” Gershowitz said.\n\n“I’ve been in the Hilltowns for almost 10 years now, and it feels like a library of people here,” he said. Dempsey and Brown, who make their money exclusively on social media sharing their Hilltown lifestyle for an audience of 1 million people, shared the same sentiment.\n\n“If you came here from a more populated town, you’d be like, ‘what are the residents like?’ And there’s such a mix of people who have been in this town their whole life that are old,” said Dempsey. “But then there’s people younger than us and it’s way more diverse than you would think.”\n\nGiven the “characters and legends” who attended, Dempsey said that, “If an apocalypse hit you’d want to be in this room.”\n\nFinn Carswell, who attends the Williston Northampton School, aspires to work in the fashion industry. He said it is often difficult to meet people outside one’s immediate circle, but on Monday he had luck and was able to connect with a lady involved in modeling.\n\nStrangers Matt DeVito and Italian author Andrea Villa, who is spending three months in town to focus on writing, sat next to each other over dinner.\n\n“I just met him. He’s a good guy though — an Italian,” said DeVito.\n\nMeanwhile Chris Ryan, who lives on the Chesterfield-Worthington line, called the night “a wonderful evening of community.”\n\nThe checklist to hold such a gathering includes people, food and a place to gather.\n\nCountless people praised Unger for hosting the night — like Vicky Dwight, who called him “the mayor of Worthington.” Dwight contributed her own part to the event and helped arrange furniture and sitting areas within the dance studio.\n\nHer daughter Isabel Dwight owed her mom some money. So instead of repaying she agreed to bartend for the night, regardless of the fact that she had no experience.\n\n“It’s important to encourage people to do this, especially during times where there is food insecurity, loneliness and isolation,” Isabel Dwight said, and added that rum and pineapple was the drink of choice.\n\nShe also shared her very concise inventory list needed to hold on events like these, saying that, “All we had was space and enough people to bring food.”\n\nLauren Cantalonis came with chips, guacamole and salsa and placed them on a 30-foot table that was loaded with food by other attendees. The table featured the essentials, turkey and all the fixings, as well as pasta dishes, potatoes, salads, appetizers, dips, desserts and a seemingly endless menu of other foods.\n\nOther volunteers laid out long tables decorated with artificial moss, votive candles and small accents. And outside, a fire pit was kept going, and people smoked their herbs of choice around it.\n\n(No) politics at the table\n\nUnger said for a gathering like this to be successful, people need to put neighbor ahead of ideology. He also believes that people aren’t as divided as social media would make it seem.\n\n“I think when we talk about our fractured climate, that’s what social media wants us to think,” he said. “I actually think we’re still talking to each other more than they want us to think we are.”\n\nAmillie Coster returned to the area, coming from Great Barrington where she works as a garden designer. She was having fun making a coded political statement for what could have been perceived as a party anthem.\n\nOn a floor to ceiling chalkboard at the entrance to the dance studio, she wrote in bold letters, “Turn the volume up,” the words Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said in his acceptance speech after winning the New York City mayoral election earlier this month.\n\n“The number one thing I ask for people to leave with tonight is that you can’t bring up politics at Thanksgiving … but you can be subliminal about it,” she said. “Just turn up the volume and it’s a dance party, so it works.”\n\nUnger got the idea to told these annual Friendsgiving celebrations from the co-owner of Lipton’s Bar and Restaurant in Worthington, Brigid Ryan. He also doesn’t want people to feel like gatherings like these are unique.\n\n“This is literally what happens in Alabama,” he said.",

We owe them the right tools.’\n\nJavaid Siddiqi at The Hill\n\nEnglish learner students are “capable of making multi-year academic gains in a single school year and represent some of the most motivated learners,” says Javaid Siddiqi. The “question isn’t whether they can succeed. It’s whether we’re equipping their teachers with the tools to help them.” Every “teacher should understand strategies to help students deconstruct texts. You can’t teach students who can’t access the reading.” The “problem is that most educator preparation programs don’t teach these strategies.”\n\n‘Is Queens the new political bellwether of America?’\n\nMichael Massing at The Guardian\n\nAs the “extraordinary Oval Office meeting” between President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani shows, “there’s a new bellwether in American politics,” says Michael Massing. Queens “contains multitudes. With a population of 2.3 million, it would be the nation’s fifth-largest city if it stood alone.” It is “thoroughly middle and working class — a swath of heartland America set down in pulsating, cosmopolitan New York.” Yet “national news organizations have treated the borough like flyover country.”\n\n‘Banning AI regulation will endanger American kids’ \n\nMichael Kleinman at Time\n\nDespite “horrific incident after horrific incident, AI companies retain carte blanche to sell products with zero meaningful safety standards or oversight,” says Michael Kleinman. No “other industry is given such freedom to endanger people with total impunity.” A “broad range of states including Utah, Texas, and California have already stepped up with important AI regulation that would be eviscerated by preemption.” This “dramatically limits the ability of states to enact commonsense regulations to protect our children.”\n\n‘The Nuzzi seizure of power’\n\nChris Lehmann at The Nation\n\nFuture “chronicles of the utter debasement of American political journalism will have to devote an entire chapter” to oral sex, says Chris Lehmann. This “salacious discourse comes off as positively quaint next to the revelations recounted by Beltway journalist Ryan Lizza in his serial Substack breakdown of the demise of his relationship with Olivia Nuzzi.” What “becomes clear across the dreary narrations” is “that all parties are in thrall to the act of portentous narration itself.”",

        "text": "Mayor-elect and self-proclaimed socialist Zohran Mamdani ran on a platform that included \"protecting\" city residents from possible deceptive information from pregnancy centers. \n\nBased on that assertion, one would think the pro-life community was out pestering every pregnant woman in Manhattan. You'd wonder if these rabid pro-lifers were just waiting to distribute red Handmaid's Tale-style robes to the unfortunate who crossed their path. \n\nYou might think that, listening to Mamdani. However, Feminists Choosing Life New York shows only 11 pregnancy care centers across the five boroughs of New York City. Residents have at least 45 options of in-person or telehealth abortion providers in the city. \n\nRev. Jim Harden, the CEO of Compass Care, which runs three of those pro-life medical pregnancy centers in Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island, shared his fears about the mayor's statements in an op-ed for LifeNews: \"Mamdani's campaign trail threats notwithstanding, what can pro-life Christian pregnancy centers realistically expect from Mayor Mamdani? The answer all depends on which of Mamdani’s fundamentalisms shows up for work. Either one is lethal to America’s Constitutional Rule of Law, rooted in Judeo-Christian beliefs, beliefs that are the basis for pro-life words and work in the public square.\" \n\nDuring his run, Mamdani's team issued a \"Trump-Proofing NYC\" Google doc position paper that includes a section devoted to \"defending reproductive rights.\" The document asserted: \n\nThe Mamdani administration will protect New Yorkers from false or deceptive information spread by Crisis Pregnancy Centers, including lies about abortion safety and medications, and enforce Local Law 17 forcing these centers to disclose whether they have licensed medical professionals. It will also strengthen the city’s Abortion Access Hub by doubling funding to $2M, which confidentially helps New Yorkers find abortion providers and supports people living outside of New York through the process of scheduling appointments and finding financial assistance. It will also double funding to the New York Abortion Access Fund, which will provide essential funding to ensure New Yorkers get the medical care they need as New Yorkers face cuts to Medicaid.\n\nHarden also questioned the way that Mamdani will strengthen Local Law 17. He noted that rules about notifications will force pregnancy centers to add cumbersome language in large fonts to advertisements, which may include \"a list of what we do not provide, such as abortion, to a phone number referring women to an abortionist.\"\n\nThe three centers in New York City, along with others that Compass Care runs across the state, offer services including pregnancy testing and ultrasounds, STD testing and treatment, abortion pill reversal, and after-abortion care. Theirs is the only organization in the city that does not have a profit motive in encouraging women to abort. \n\nHarden's organization is already fighting a lawsuit from New York Attorney Letitia James, New York City, and New York State. If it is this difficult to stay in business and offer pro-life counselling and services now, what will women in crisis do after Mamdani is inaugurated in January?\n\nNow is the BEST time to subscribe to PJ Media.

If you enjoy their collaboration, email them at yrodriguez@cleveland.com, ldaprile@cleveland.com.\n\nDear Yadi and Lucas: The next few months are going to be difficult for me. With the holidays come family gatherings. I love my family, but they always make comments on what I eat. I am in my 20s and an adult.\n\nMy weight has fluctuated my entire life; I have always been one of the larger people in my family. And my family always comments on my weight and what I eat at family gatherings.\n\nIt has gotten to the point where I hesitate to go. It feels like I’m being watched the entire time, and I worry about someone seeing me eat this or that. I have even eaten before going so that I don’t have to worry about being hungry while there, but then I get yelled at for not eating.\n\nI’m in a no-win situation. How do I attend family gatherings without being constantly scrutinized for eating or not eating?\n\nDear Reader: There are some people in this world who are emotionally well-adjusted enough to have a conversation with you about why that would hurt your feelings. However, I don’t imagine the people going out of their way to embarrass you at a family gathering are those people. \n\nIn that case, you’re perfectly justified in terrorizing your relatives.\n\nAvoiding politics at the dinner table has become a cliche in the Tr*mp era, so mentioning ICE or Zohran Mamdani (make sure you mispronounce it) will surely go over as well as smoking cigarettes inside an orphanage. \n\nWhile your uncles fight over who can be the most racist and your cousin hides in the bathroom, you can sit back and enjoy your green bean casserole in peace.\n\nIf you’ve been taking care of your mental health and aren’t up to date on politics, I understand. There are other ways to ruin everyone else’s holiday. \n\nBefore the turkey is carved, pick it up, jam your head through the cavity and wear it like a mask. Pretend to be a pilgrim and do silly little dances, amusing the young nieces and nephews. As the heat from the overcooked turkey scorches your face and you bumble around the kitchen, colliding with the walls and screaming about how horrible of an idea this all was, your relatives will back off. \n\nNot only will they finally see how funny you are, they will also realize that if they want to eat at all, they better stay on your good side. \n\nREAD Yadi’s take here.\n\nPrevious Ask Lucas/Ask Yadi collaborations",

Does he have some work to do still in winning over the support of first responders in New York?”\n\nTucker simply responded Mamdani “has a tremendous amount of work to do and I think it’s work well worth doing” and even though he “respect[s]” Tisch for staying on, “I know she respects me for my decision to leave.”\n\nDokoupil then asked Tucker straight up if he’s resigning because he’s Jewish: “To what extent is this decision of yours about being a Jewish new Yorker?”\n\n“Yeah, I think it’s a factor, no doubt, and I don’t want to tell you that it’s the only factor, but I believe that the things that I have heard the mayor say would make it difficult for me to continue on in – in such a senior executive role in the administration,” Tucker explained, remaining vague while also leaving little doubt to those who could read between the lines.\n\nDokoupil then outlined how Tucker has not been alone in feeling concern for their ability to be Jewish in New York under someone who’s voiced an “opposition to Israel as a Jewish state.”\n\nTo this, Tucker further emphasized he and Mamdani would have “very fundamental things” they would disagree on if he were to have stayed (click “expand”):\n\nDOKOUPIL: Mamdani’s political rise has been taken as an ominous sign by many Jewish leaders –\n\nRABBI ANGELA BUCHDAHL: Zohran Mamdani has contributed to a mainstreaming of some of the most abhorrent anti-Semitism.\n\nDOKOUPIL: – who point to, among other things, his opposition to Israel as a Jewish state.\n\nTUCKER: Look, it’s a complicated, emotional decision to leave, but ideologically there’s no doubt that the mayor and I disagree on some very fundamental things to me.\n\nTucker specifically cited Mamdani’s callous response to the gang of thugs congregating around and blocking entrance to the Park East Synagogue on November 19 that Dokoupil explained for the uninitiated:\n\nIn a protest last week outside a synagogue hosting an event to support Jewish immigration to Israel, activists shouted threats. A Mamdani spokesperson was later quoted saying he “discouraged the language,” adding, in an apparent nod of support to the protesters, that “these sacred spaces should not be used to promote activities in violation of international law.”\n\nTucker said “I don’t know that the public has heard appropriately from him” and, for those that did see his response, Tucker opined Mamdani “could have come out very quickly and condemned the behavior and some of the rhetoric,” but he didn’t.\n\nThe interview came to a close with this remarkable admission from Tucker that he has received no communication from Mamdani and his team:\n\nI haven’t had any personal conversations with the mayor-elect, I haven’t heard from anyone in his incoming administration nor has the department and so, I only hope that – that that is not an indicator of their feelings about the FDNY. I’d like to think they think everything is going so well here that they don’t need to transition so fast.\n\nBack live, Dokoupil concluded by emphasizing Tucker “loves his job” and “the people he is working with in general,” so this “was clearly an emotion and personal decision.” Despite his resignation, Dokoupil added, Tucker “is wishing Mamdani all the best, all the success in the world.”\n\nGoing to break, Dokoupil blurted out that he too has received no response from Mamdani and his team: “Oh, wait, I should add we asked the Mamdani campaign for comment. We did not hear back. So, yeah.”\n\nTo see the relevant CBS transcript from November 26, click here.",

The speaker is the second-most powerful elected official in city government, with control over which legislation gets brought up for votes. The speaker also negotiates the city’s budget of around $120 billion.\n\nMenin is reportedly skeptical of Mamdani’s plan for a new Department of Community Safety that would dispatch social workers to certain mental health emergencies, rather than the NYPD. Like Mamdani, Menin has broad support from influential unions.\n\n“I am honored and humbled by the trust and faith that my colleagues have put in me to lead the City Council as a force of action for New York families,” Menin said in a statement declaring she had secured the votes of 36 of her colleagues. The Council has 51 members.\n\nHer office did not provide a list of members who had committed their support ahead of the January 7 vote. A spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for the list. \n\nThe speaker’s race is seen as a test of an incoming mayor’s political capital. Previous mayors have tried to influence the outcome by lobbying members of the Council to pick a preferred candidate. Mayor Bill de Blasio handpicked his ally Melissa Mark-Viverito during his first term. In 2021, Mayor Eric Adams unsuccessfully waded into the race by lobbying for Queens councilmember and moderate Democrat Francisco Moya. The race was eventually won by Adrienne Adams, who battled with the mayor over the budget and legislation.\n\nMamdani has not yet publicly weighed in on the race.\n\nMenin served as the city’s director of the 2020 census, when New York officials feared Trump administration interference would result in an undercount.\n\nCouncilmember Crystal Hudson, who represents parts of Brooklyn, is also vying for the speaker role. She did not respond to an inquiry.\n\nMenin’s Council district went for former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the mayoral election. Hudson’s backed Mamdani.\n\nThe Council is expected to vote for the next speaker on Jan. 7.",

        "text": "Total falsehoods: \"I want for people to recognize a great job that I've done on pricing, on affordability, because we brought prices way down,\" said President Donald Trump on Monday. (The White House released a semi-propagandistic fact sheet that same day to bolster the president's talking points, as all White Houses do at one time or another.)\n\n\"We are doing better than we've ever done as a country. Prices are coming down and all of that stuff,\" he said the week before. \"And you know, they talk about different terms for that, but I will tell you that nobody has done what we've done in terms of pricing.\"\n\n\"Walmart just announced that the cost of their standard Thanksgiving meal is reduced by 25 percent this year from last year,\" Trump said recently, failing to account for the fact that the price change is due to Walmart…changing the goods offered via their Thanksgiving meal bundle (and drastically shrinking its size) to get prices lower for cost-burdened consumers.\n\n\"Since January 2025, the Consumer Price Index has ranged between 3.3 percent and 2.7 percent,\" writes National Review's Jim Geraghty. \"That's much better than the worst days of the Biden administration in 2022, but that's also roughly where it was for Biden's final year in office.\"\n\nBut Trump, ever a salesman, recognizes which messages are winning for other politicians: It's affordability season, and you've gotta appeal to people's bottom lines if you want to be taken seriously right now.\n\nThe Free Press' related entry into this discourse is rather interesting, albeit wrong: \"The poverty line, a six-decade-old benchmark, claims to define the threshold to the middle class,\" writes Michael W. Green. \"The number is a lie.\"\n\nGreen goes on to promote the idea that a household income of $100,000 is \"the new poverty\"; that the reason the affordability messaging is so salient is because even households that look well-off on paper are actually struggling to make ends meet; that the ways we measure poverty and economic struggle are way outdated.\n\n\"In 1963, Mollie Orshansky, an economist at the Social Security Administration, observed that families spent roughly one-third of their income on groceries,\" writes Green. \"Since pricing data was hard to come by for many items (e.g., housing), if you could calculate a minimum adequate food budget at the grocery store, you could multiply by three and establish a poverty line. Orshansky presented her findings in 1965. She was drawing a floor, a line below which families were clearly in crisis.\" (This is not totally correct; the actual story of how the poverty line was calculated is a bit more complex.)\n\n\"For that time, that floor made sense,\" continues Green. \"Housing was relatively cheap. A family could rent a decent apartment or buy a home on a single income. Healthcare was provided by employers and cost relatively little (Blue Cross coverage cost in the range of $10 per month). Childcare didn't really exist as a market—mothers stayed home, family helped, or neighbors (who likely had someone home) watched each others' kids. Cars were affordable, if prone to breakdowns. College tuition could be covered with a summer job.\" Today, argues Green, the labor market has transformed, requiring two earners, not one—and thus child care expenses (for families that end up having kids, which is to say: not everyone). Housing is a larger share of the monthly household budget. Ditto for health care. \"If you keep Orshansky's logic—if you maintain her principle that poverty could be defined by the inverse of food's budget share—but update the food share to reflect today's reality, the multiplier is no longer three,\" argues Green. \"It becomes 16. Which means if you measured income inadequacy today the way Orshansky measured it in 1963, the threshold for a family of four—the official poverty line in 2024—wouldn't be $31,200. If the crisis threshold—the floor below which families cannot function—is honestly updated to current spending patterns, it lands at close to $140,000.\"\n\n\"The idea that over time we should dynamically multiply a food budget by the inverse of food's share of the budget to get the poverty line is laughable,\" argues American Enterprise Institute's Scott Winship. \"Engel's law says that as societies grow richer, the food share of the budget falls. But by Green's logic, the richest possible society is really the poorest. If we got the food share down to 1% of household budgets, we'd need to multiply the food budget by 99 instead of Green's 16. This multiplier is actually a measure of a society's affluence!\"\n\nI'm persuaded by Winship's argument that this model is bad and I think Green's argument sells short the massive quality-of-life gains we've had since the '60s. Success and stability, to my mind, are not defined solely by material objects. But at the same time, the fact that pretty much all of us have little tiny supercomputers in our pockets that connect us to infinite reserves of knowledge (and to each other) is a vast improvement. The fact that household goods are cheap and easy to come by is no small thing (even though we sometimes trick ourselves into believing durability is suffering, when nowadays, a lot of the time, the cost of repair is higher than the cost of replacing). Sure, a lot of people are wasting $150,000 (or more) on educations that, well, maybe they could've gotten for \"$1.50 in late fees at the public library\"—but isn't it a huge boon to self-starters everywhere that you don't even need to go to the public library anymore to access that type of knowledge? The worldwide web is a gift to us all (if only we'd stop mainlining 60-second vertical videos).\n\nAt the same time, despite his bad model and questionable portrayal of history, Green is correct to identify housing, child care, health care, and education costs as areas that have not gotten better over time to the degree that many of us had hoped. These are extreme pain points for many Americans, particularly for those who find themselves too rich for welfare, but too poor to be able to have much margin. (\"Our entire safety net is designed to catch people at the very bottom,\" writes Green, accurately, \"but it sets a trap for anyone trying to climb out.\")\n\nIt's easy to say issues like housing are only bad in large metro areas, not the rest of the country, but roughly 20 percent of the U.S. population lives in a large metro area (20 million in New York, 13 million in L.A., 9 million in Chicago, 8 million apiece in Dallas and Houston). Six percent of the U.S. population lives within the New York metro area alone. And it is a good thing for people to care about agglomeration effects and to want to go where the jobs are, to be upwardly mobile and thus geographically mobile; if the price to doing so is incurring massive housing costs, one response is that those tradeoffs are natural and part of life. Another response is that we're disincentivizing people who would otherwise be highly productive workers, that we're making it costlier for them to pursue the most productive use of their time and talent.\n\nIt's the same story with child care expenses. There's no way around the fact that child care requires lots of human labor. But most localities have heaped on burdensome regulations and degree requirements that make it even harder and more expensive to hire competent workers and maintain licensed facilities. One answer to this is for families to have only one earner during the young-kid years, not two; but this comes at great cost to future earnings, and it can be easier to enter and exit at will in some industries than in others. The young-kid years are relatively short (especially as family sizes shrink), but it's not crazy for families in larger metro areas to feel hit rather hard by the dual needs of child care and housing.\n\nPerhaps the greatest issue with Green's writing is that he confuses \"poverty\" and \"economic strain.\" It is very possible that dual-earner households making six figures feel economic strain from high child care, housing, and health care costs. But feeling encumbered by tradeoffs is rather different than being poor. We should allow these words to retain their meanings. Affordability discourse is useless if it's not accurate, and every politician and pundit should strive to accurately describe Americans' financial realities, not inflate or exaggerate hardship to serve a particular political agenda.\n\nMost of the time, politicians will offer one solution and one solution only: the warm embrace of the state to alleviate people's financial woes. In reality, getting the state the hell out of the way would help bring down prices in most of the categories people cite as the ones giving them the most trouble.\n\nScenes from New York: Incoming mayor Zohran Mamdani has asked 179 Eric Adams staffers to resign from their City Hall posts. Mamdani \"has already named Dean Fuleihan, a longtime government hand, as his first deputy mayor and has retained the police commissioner, Jessica Tisch,\" reports The New York Times. His longtime top aide, Elle Bisgaard-Church, will serve as his chief of staff. (\"Ursulina Ramirez, who helped lead Bill de Blasio's transition in 2013, said Mr. Mamdani's housecleaning was reminiscent of Mr. de Blasio's after he succeeded Michael R. Bloomberg,\" per the Times.)\n\nHappy Thanksgiving! Look, I like politics, but what I really like is PIE. DM me/email me/sound off in the comments section about the most important issue of all: Which pies are you baking/eating tomorrow? I always make the GoHo, a recipe I adapted from Martha Stewart and have made dozens of times over the years, with elements of pecan but a little more sophistication than your standard pecan-and-corn-syrup getup. This year I am also experimenting with a cranberry curd tart (think tarte au citron but a little tangier, with a delicate hazelnut crust) and a maple chess pie with coffee whipped cream. And, in the spirit of the holiday, let me also mention: I am so deeply grateful for each person who takes time out of their busy day to read this newsletter. I hope it leaves you better informed and even makes you chuckle every once in a while. Cheers to freedom and to pie!\n\"My therapist always asks me to transcribe my dreams and the recurring dream I've had is standing up in a cafeteria full of women and saying 'I don't want children. I want power!'\" said Tennessee state representative Aftyn Behn on a recent podcast. And indeed, power she seeks: Behn is running to represent Tennessee's 7th congressional district and replace U.S. Rep. Mark Green, a Republican, in a special election that will be held on December 2. Maybe it's just me, but any politician who is so blatant about wanting power immediately rubs me the wrong way. Behn should want to improve the lives of her constituents.

        "text": "About five years ago, the comedian Ryan Long posted a video in which a woke progressive and an old-fashioned racist meet and, much to their astonishment, discover that rather than being bitterly opposed, they agree on pretty much everything.\n\nThere was a strong echo of that convergence in last week's White House tete-a-tete between Republican President Donald Trump and New York's new socialist Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. Anticipated to be a grudge match, it instead turned into something of a lovefest. Well, of course it did. As fans of horseshoe theory accurately point out, control freaks from the political extremes might differ on details, but they have more in common with each other than they do with people who respect each other's liberty.\n\nTrump and Mamdani in 'a Place of Shared Admiration and Love'\n\nIn reporting on the meeting, The Hill noted, \"Trump and Mamdani answered questions from reporters, both striking a remarkably cordial tone, with the president indicating he agreed with many of the mayor-elect's ideas.\"\n\nAccording to Mamdani, \"It was a productive meeting focused on a place of shared admiration and love.\"\n\nTrump added that Mamdani would be \"hopefully a really great mayor.\" He also commented, \"There's no difference in party. There's no difference in anything.\"\n\nSo, how did two politicians who entered the meeting slinging epithets at each other like \"communist\" and \"fascist\" exit with the makings of a mutual admiration society? There's a hint in a question a BBC reporter posed to the new mayor at the White House when he commented \"you're both populist\" and asked, \"to what extent the president's campaign…inspired any part of your campaign?\"\n\nMamdani eagerly brought up cost-of-living and economic concerns while Trump nodded and then chimed in with agreement about concerns over the price of energy.\n\nThat's the key to this meeting of the minds. Trump and Mamdani are strongly focused on economic issues. They also share a taste for addressing those concerns with government direction.\n\nTwo Paths to Socialism\n\nMamdani boasts of his open socialism. He's gone so far as to call for \"seizing the means of production.\" He won office with a campaign that promised city-run grocery stores, a rent freeze, and free buses, child care, and other services funded by higher taxes on whoever can be interpreted as \"wealthy.\" That should be interesting since he wants to tax the extremely wealthy out of existence.\n\nIn an exercise of what can be called \"Republican socialism,\" Trump actually did seize a portion of the means of production when his administration leaned on U.S. Steel for a \"golden share\" of the company. Under his leadership, the federal government has also taken ownership positions in firms including Intel, Lithium Americas, and Trilogy Metals. Trump's protectionism is crafted to enable the state to push firms to revive domestic manufacturing—or else.\n\nMamdani believes in government control of the economy for the sake of achieving socialism. Trump endorses government control of the economy to accomplish his nationalist goals. But whatever they call their views, both men think political leaders should be directing economic activity.\n\nWhat brought Mamdani to socialism is probably best left as a question for his shrink, his parents, and his college professors. But Trump's path to state control of the economy almost certainly lies in his nationalist impulses. He came to office on the slogan \"Make America Great Again\" and has enthusiastically used the power of the federal government to enact what he believes that means, often replacing individual choice with politicians' preferences.\n\nAs the economist Friedrich Hayek wrote in his 1960 book, The Constitution of Liberty, \"It is this nationalistic bias which frequently provides the bridge from conservatism to collectivism. To think in terms of 'our' industry or resource is only a short step away from demanding that these national assets be directed in the national interest.\"\n\nHayek differentiated nationalism from patriotism, which he considered pride in your origins as opposed to nationalism's collectivism and xenophobia. The shared collectivism of socialism and nationalism, he added, is why \"we frequently find the conservatives joining hands with the socialists against the liberals.\"\n\nInevitably Shared Authoritarianism\n\nWhether collectivist economic impulses are exercised by nationalists or by socialists, Hayek observed that the result is inevitably authoritarian. When the state controls economic activity, it can deny permits, withhold resources, cut off finance, impose punitive taxes, and otherwise make existence independent of the state almost impossible.\n\n\"Economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends,\" Hayek warned in his 1944 book, The Road to Serfdom. \"And whoever has sole control of the means must also determine which ends are to be served, which values are to be rated higher and which lower, in short, what men should believe and strive for.\"\n\nFrom different directions, Trump and Mamdani have arrived at agreement that economic activity should be directed by government officials over the objections of those who want to make their own decisions about their property, their businesses, and their money. They got along so well together at the White House because, like Ryan Long's fictional wokester and racist, they were delighted to discover the similarities in their desires for a society controlled from the top.\n\nYes, Mamdani is back to calling Trump a \"fascist,\" but there's a quality of rote recital to it. He's giving his supporters what they expect. Trump will probably call him a communist again. But they're not bitter enemies; the two men are rivals peddling similar products and vying for market share.\n\nHolding Onto Individualism\n\nIn opposition to both these representatives of neighboring arms of the ideological horseshoe are Hayek-style classical liberals, libertarians, and other individualists. Advocates of liberty oppose collectivism and state control whether it's called socialism, nationalism, or some other name. We see society as a cooperative endeavor among free individuals, not as a collective to be commanded from above.\n\nUnfortunately, Mamdani and Trump represent political movements that are consuming their respective political parties. If they're successful in displacing the remaining relatively individualistic voices, the political choices offered in the future by the major parties will be nothing more than competing brands of collectivism. Of course, collectivists favor a world in which choices are made for us.",

        "text": "For the first time, FDNY Commissioner Robert S. Tucker is explaining why he decided to announce his resignation just one day after Zohran Mamdani won the New York City mayoral race.\"Look, it's a complicated, emotional decision to leave. But ideologically, there's no doubt that the mayor and I disagree on some very fundamental things to me,\" Tucker, who was appointed to the role in August 2024, told \"CBS Mornings\" in his first interview since handing in his resignation letter on Nov. 5.In a closely-watched decision last week, Tucker's police counterpart, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch accepted Mamdani's offer to stay in her role. Months before the election, Mamdani softened his sharp criticism of the NYPD and clarified that he is \"not running to defund the police,\" distancing himself from old social media posts.Despite his public apology to the NYPD, Tucker said Mamdani still has some work to do when it comes to winning over the support of first responders. Beyond that, some of Mamdani's stances, like his refusal to support Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, have alarmed many Jewish New Yorkers.\"I think it's a factor [in my decision to resign], no doubt,\" said Tucker, who is Jewish. \"And I don't want to tell you that it's the only factor. But I believe that the things that I have heard the mayor say would make it difficult for me to continue on in such a senior executive role in the administration.\"According to exit polls, 31% of Jewish New Yorkers voted for Mamdani, with 65% voting for independent opponent Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani won every borough but Staten Island.In an October debate, Mamdani, who will make history as New York City's first Muslim mayor, vowed to \"be the mayor who doesn't just protect Jewish New Yorkers, but also celebrates and cherishes them.\"However, Tucker and some prominent Jewish leaders – like Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, the senior rabbi at New York City's Central Synagogue – aren't convinced by the mayor-elect's words of reassurance. In an October sermon, Buchdal accused Mamdani of contributing \"to a mainstreaming of some of the most abhorrent antisemitism.\"\"More importantly than hearing it, we want to see it,\" Tucker said.He pointed to Mamdani's response to a protest last week outside of an Upper East Side synagogue hosting an event to support Jewish emigration to Israel, during which activists shouted threats. A Mamdani spokesperson was later quoted saying he \"discouraged the language,\" adding in an apparent nod of support to the protesters that \"these sacred spaces should not be used to promote activities in violation of international law.\"Tucker said Mamdani should have come out quickly to condemn the behavior and rhetoric.\"You know, I don't know that the public has heard appropriately from him,\" he said.Inside headquarters in Brooklyn, where the FDNY coordinates responses to emergencies across America's biggest city, Tucker says they're still waiting for outreach from Mamdani.\"I haven't had any personal conversations with the mayor-elect. I haven't heard from anyone in his incoming administration, nor has the department. And so I only hope that is not an indicator of their feelings about the FDNY. I'd like to think they think everything is going so well here that they don't need to transition so fast,\" he joked.Mamdani and his team have not responded to CBS News' requests for comment on this story.",

        "text": "The wife of Trump henchman Stephen Miller lashed out at MSNBC veteran Joy Reid over comments Reid made about JD Vance’s marriage to second lady Usha. \n\nDuring a fiery segment on The Ingraham Angle, Katie Miller, a former Trump White House aide turned podcaster, erupted after Reid suggested Vance was pandering to a base she described as “fundamentally racist.”\n\nReid’s appearance on the I’ve Had It podcast, where she argued it would be a “MAGA fairytale” for Vance to ditch his Indian-American wife, Usha Vance, for “a white woman.”\n\nThe remark ricocheted across conservative media—and landed squarely in Laura Ingraham’s lap.\n\n“RACIST REID STRIKES AGAIN,” was the message the Fox News chyron blasted into the homes of millions of Americans. \n\n“Over on The View, Joy Reid is already attacking JD Vance and Vance’s wife. Watch,” Ingraham told viewers before rolling the clip. While the podcast’s hosts, Jennifer Welch and Angie Sullivan, have appeared on The View, their podcast is not expressly linked to the show.\n\nReid, who has also appeared on The View but isn’t a regular, didn’t mince words. “They can’t have the successor MAGA to be a brown and Hindu wife... He is throwing his wife under the bus, poor Usha, or she is in on it.”\n\nIngraham then brought in Miller, 34, who served as deputy press secretary during President Donald Trump’s first administration, who promptly flipped the racism accusation back on Democrats. “I think the only racists here are those in the Democratic Party and those who exist on MS NOW, whatever that is, MS DNC,” Miller snapped. She insisted Vance “does it with such praise and devotion in his heart” whenever he talks about his wife and called the scrutiny of their relationship “disgusting” and “gross.”\n\n“And all they have left to do is these deranged identity-based attacks,” she continued, claiming Democrats resort to personal smears because “they don’t have any platforms to run on.”\n\nThe melodrama comes as the Vances confront a string of viral, marriage-themed mini-scandals. The furor mutated earlier this week when the vice president visited Camp Lejeune in North Carolina with first lady Melania Trump and was photographed without his wedding ring. The images ballooned into online theories about marital trouble—preceded by an earlier controversy involving the widow of Charlie Kirk.\n\nAt a Turning Point USA event in Mississippi, Erika Kirk introduced Vance in a moment that instantly caught fire online. “No one will ever replace my husband,” she said of the conservative activist, who was murdered on Sept. 10, while speaking on a college campus in Utah. But she added, “I do see some similarities… in Vice President JD Vance.” Their subsequent embrace—Erika clutching his head while his hands drifted into her hip zone—only fueled more gossip.\n\nThe Vances married in 2014 after meeting at Yale Law School and share three children: Ewan, 8, Vivek, 5, and Mirabel, 3. And while the vice president has stayed publicly silent through the cascading speculation, a spokesperson for Vance chose to address the saga.\n\nMiller, meanwhile, is partial to an on-air meltdown. Last month, she erupted during a heated panel debate on Piers Morgan Uncensored. The panel was supposed to discuss then-New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s comments that Islamophobia is “endemic” in the country. Instead, Miller accused everyone of antisemitism and threatened to walk off the show and never return.",

And as FAA administrator Sean Duffy encourages Americans to don their finest formal wear in anticipation of their voyaging, perhaps it’s worth strapping on your corset and/or cummerbund as we take a Day-Before-Thanksgiving tour of our shared destination. Because wherever American families gather, this year, their location will be the same: Crazy Town. \n\nWe can all agree on that.\n\nAn astronaut and combat pilot is being investigated by the “Department of War” for instructing members of the military to follow the law. \n\nA Russian-authored “peace plan” which gives Vladimir Putin everything he wants in exchange for, essentially, Ukrainian surrender, is being touted as official American policy. \n\nAnd speaking of the former Soviet Union, at the same time the United States government is bashing the “communist” mayor-elect of New York City Zohran Mamdani, they’re snapping up ownership stakes in private companies, which is a helluva lot closer to actual communism. To paraphrase a Katy Perry song of a certain vintage, after their Oval Office meet-cute, Trump kissed a Pinko—and he liked it. \n\nThere’s the idiocy of our current tariff situation, in which the president staked the American economy on a plan to tax the hell out of everybody, but mostly the American public. The result: prices are up despite the White House’s failed attempts to massage those Walmart “Thanksgiving meal” numbers—and people are pissed. To rectify the situation, the administration is now selectively removing tariffs from random products; the party of free trade is now reaching into the American economy and instituting what amounts to price controls on certain goods and services.\n\nNot that I think Trump and his ilk are closet Reds any more than I think they’re closet humanitarians. Instead, the headlines we’re seeing point to something worse than a full Marxist takeover of the American government. Marxism, at least, has an animating ideal. \n\nOne of the many problems with installing an amoral doofus without a coherent governing philosophy at the helm of the world’s richest and mightiest nation is that such a person will then behave as an amoral doofus without a coherent governing philosophy.\n\nWhat follows is what we see: a disparate hodgepodge of ad hoc, often contradictory policy positions which leave the nation uncertain and vulnerable. The reason, for example, Covid-19 hit us so hard wasn’t just because we were dealing with a novel pathogen, but we were doing at the same time we were dealing with said amoral doofus discarding an entire playbook—one literally titled “Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological Incidents”—designed to deal with a future epidemiological nightmare Oopsie! And that was when we still had competent people like Dr. Anthony Fauci heading most of our federal agencies. Imagine the response to a future pandemic if RFK Jr. is in charge. Horse paste for everyone!\n\nSpeaking of which: If those high food costs have you trimming your turkey budget, I bet you could get some high-quality horsemeat on the cheap. Spread a little Ivermectin and pesticide on there and you’ve got yourself a delicious spin on the traditional open-faced leftover sandwich! \n\nA government powered by spite is unlikely to be a government that inspires confidence. Poll after poll screams “danger,” showing the administration on the same glidepath as the UPS plane that crashed in Kentucky last week. Sure, it got off the ground but not for long. That’s kind of where we find ourselves approaching the one-year mark of the second Burger King administration, a nation hurtling disaster, and the American public knows it.\n\nOne thing about data sets; they tend to return to the mean. After the executive order blitzkrieg of his first several months in office, orders which had Trump’s political opponents scrambling, the opposition appears to have found some footing. The judiciary (sans the nakedly partisan Supreme Court) is leading the way, with the Trump administration losing most of the cases it brings. \n\nCitizens have mobilized. Elections are being held and, just like last time, Republicans are being unceremoniously dumped from office. Former allies like Marjorie Taylor Greene are breaking for the exits. And yesterday, we learned that, with eight months still to run on its charter, DOGE is now no more. (The agency did tweet yesterday that it’s still around, but my sources say that was just Big Balls roaming around the empty offices looking for an accountant to fire.) While DOGE may have failed to eliminate any “waste, fraud, and abuse” it did succeed in eliminating an incalculable number of human lives. I mean that literally—it’s impossible to calculate the true scale of deaths that eliminating USAID and other programs caused.\n\nThe president, too, has returned to his own meanness. Not that it ever went away. Gone is the triumphal preening of his first 100 days, the arrogance of the dressing down of Zelenskyy in the Oval Office replaced with a mortifying “Quiet, piggy” to a female reporter in the back of Air Force One. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight despite the turbulence. And do try to ignore the ground rushing up to greet us. \n\nHappy Thanksgiving.",

        "text": "President Donald Trump spent some time at the presidential turkey pardoning to mention prices going down, but polls show voters aren't giving him a stamp of approval on the economy just yet.\n\nBefore the week of Thanksgiving, Trump had a standout week with an eyebrow-raising meeting with New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. The two men from Queens discussed affordability in a friendly meeting on Nov. 21 despite their political differences.\n\nTrump has also wanted to reclaim winning on the economy, like mentioning on Nov. 25 Walmart's Thanksgiving meal bundle being 25% less expensive than last year (though it has fewer items).\n\nSome voters put the economy as the most important factor in how they judge Trump. What is Trump's approval rating? See the recent polls:\n\nEric Trump reveals moment: What did Barron Trump tell Biden at the inauguration?\n\nWhat is Trump's approval rating?\n\nAverages based on RealClearPolitics and New York Times aggregators show Trump's approval rating is net negative, and after months of being relatively stable, has dropped in over the last month.\n\nAs of Jan. 27, 50.5% approved, giving Trump a net positive rating until March 13, when it flipped to net negative with 47.8% approval, compared to 48.5% disapproval, RealClearPolitics graphics show. The approval rating reached a low on April 29 at 45.1% approval, which fell around Trump's 100-day mark. It reached a new low of 42.3% on Nov. 14, as the controversy on Jeffrey Epstein's emails heated up following the end of the government shutdown. As of Nov. 25, 43% approve and 54.8% disapprove.\n\nThe New York Times aggregator showed Trump's approval fell from 52% approval in January to 44% approval in April, and then mostly held steady for months. According to the Times, Trump's term low is 41% approval, which he first reached on Nov. 12. His disapproval also notched up to 56% on Nov. 19, a high for this term per the aggregator.\n\nHow does President Donald Trump's approval rating compare to past presidents?\n\nIn a Gallup poll conducted from Oct. 1-16, 41% approved of Trump's job performance, up slightly from the previous month.\n\nA historical analysis by Gallup shows Trump's approval ratings in October of his first years in office − both as the 45th and 47th presidents − are lower than any other modern president at the same time in their administrations. Here is how his October approval compares to other presidents in October of their first year of their term, according to Gallup:\n\nJoe Biden (October 2021) - 42% approveTrump (October 2017) - 37% approveBarack Obama (October 2009) - 53% approveGeorge W. Bush (October 2001) - 88% approveBill Clinton (October 1993) - 48% approveGeorge H.W. Bush (October 1989) - 68% approveRonald Reagan (October 1981) - 55% approve\n\nCBS News: 60% of Americans say Trump makes the economy sound better than it is\n\nIn a CBS News/YouGov poll conducted Nov. 19-21, Trump received a 40% approval rating. The survey included 2,489 U.S. adults with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points.\n\nWhen asked how Trump makes things sound in regard to prices and inflation, 60% said he makes them sound better than they really are, compared to 27% who responded he makes them sound about as they are, and 13% who said worse, according to CBS. Respondents were also most likely to say the economy and inflation are the most important things when judging the Trump administration.\n\nMorning Consult: Best policy areas are immigration, national security\n\nA Morning Consult poll conducted Nov. 21-23 found 45% of responders approved of Trump's job performance, compared to 52% who disapprove. The poll surveyed 2,200 registered U.S. voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nOn handling specific issues, Trump received the worst disapproval on health care and the economy, according to Morning Consult. The best issues for Trump, according to the poll, on national security and immigration.\n\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

Speaking on a recent episode of the Inside Trump's Head podcast, the reporter cited a source “quite up close to what is going on” in the administration, who summed up the internal reaction to the Mamdani visit as “What the f---?” Trump's behavior was so out of left field that it gave some in the White House concerns about the president's mental state. \n\n“Nobody expected that. This was not the script,\" Wolff said of the source's reaction. \"It was completely out of the blue... and concerning. This wasn’t just losing the plot. This was like a different guy. The look in his eyes was crazy.”\n\nPrior to the meeting, Trump's comments about Mamdani had been overwhelmingly negative, calling him a \"communist lunatic,\" musing that the administration might have him arrested and, at one point, suggesting that he might be in the country \"illegally\" despite being a naturalized citizen.\n\n“The only explanation was that the guy forgot who he is—so weird,” Wolff's source added. “It gives you a 25th Amendment shiver.”\n\nThe 25th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, while largely concerned with more standard succession issues surrounding the presidency, also contains key provisions allowing for the removal of the president's powers and responsibilities should the vice president and a majority of the cabinet agree that they are not currently mentally or physically able to carry them out. The vice president would become the acting president for as long as it takes for the president to regain their ability, or until they leave office. Since being ratified in 1967, it has largely been invoked in instances where the president is incapacitated during medical procedures.",

        "text": "Hot Air's David Strom asks, \"Just How Bad Will Mamdani Be?\" The answer is pretty darn bad, and that may be an understatement.\n\nFor any executive political office, listening to what a politician says about what he's going to do is only part of the equation. The actual test of the way someone will govern in an executive capacity is in who they choose to advise them. Choosing the advisors reveals the inner workings of an executive's mind, and Mamdani has told us a lot about that little voice in his head by looking at the people he's chosen to sit on his advisory committees.\n\nOn Monday, the socialist mayor-elect released a list of his advisors for his \"community safety committee.\" It should actually be called the \"dismantle the NYPD committee.\" Some of the characters he named to advise him are straight out of a Karl Marx comic book. \n\nTake Professor Alex Vitale, Professor of Sociology and Coordinator of the Policing and Social Justice Project at Brooklyn College and the CUNY Graduate Center. Is this guy punking us, or is he serious?\n\n🚨 “Kill the Cop in Our Head”: Mamdani Transition Pick Rejects Reform, Calls Policing “Violence Work,” and Advocates for \"Pod Mapping\"Zohran Mamdani just appointed Professor Alex Vitale to his community safety transition team.Vitale says it plainly, “Policing is about… pic.twitter.com/jvwgh3CUt6— Stu Smith (@thestustustudio) November 25, 2025\n\n“Policing is about violence work, and I want to get the violence out of it, whatever we call it.” “It also doesn’t mean everything has to be under the control of the state… we can do co-counseling and we can do pod mapping. We can do that person-to-person organizing of our daily lives and our living spaces and our working spaces.”\n\nGolly gosh darn it, I can see paradise by the dashboard light. This guy should be kept more than 500 yards from any police station in the city.\n\nAnother entrant in the \"Craziest Marxist Appointed by Mamdani\" sweepstakes is Tamika Mallory. Mallory was a moving force behind the 2017 Women's March opposing Donald Trump's inauguration. Actually, the Women's March was nothing more than a radical-left bitch session about life in general.

She's advising the mayor-elect on the best way to organize what may be called a new \"Department of Community Safety.\" Or it may be called a \"criminal's best friend.\"\n\nExclusively for our VIPs: America's Golden Age Will End Unless We Can Control Entitlement Spending\n\nMallory has a \"history,\" as her apologists might say. She was buddy-buddy with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and has been quoted as saying some very antisemitic things about Jews.\n\nIn 2018, however, Ms. Mallory came under scrutiny after Tablet magazine reported that she and another march leader, Carmen Perez, had suggested during an early planning meeting in 2016 that Jews “bore a special collective responsibility as exploiters of black and brown people” and repeated the false claim that Jews led the American slave trade.Such debunked allegations feature prominently in “The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews,” a book by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan that historian Henry Louis Gates Jr. described in 1992 as “the bible of the new anti-Semitism.” The Anti-Defamation League has identified Mr. Farrakhan as “one of the most prominent antisemites in America.”Ms. Mallory has denied the Tablet account, though she has repeatedly expressed public support for Mr. Farrakhan. In 2017, she posted a photo with Mr. Farrakhan on Instagram, wishing him happy birthday and calling him “the GOAT.” The following year she attended and promoted a Farrakhan event where he accused “Satanic Jews” of having a “grip on the media” and declared that “the powerful Jews are my enemy.”\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League (ADL) called Mallory “simply the wrong choice for a committee on community safety.”\n\nAn ADL spokesman told the Sun, “Given the fact that New York’s Jewish community is facing antisemitism and security threats at unprecedented levels, the mayor-elect needs to appoint someone who will unite, rather than divide, communities.\"\n\nWhen announcing the committees, Mamdani stated that a \"love for hard work, a deep belief in the promise of New York City, and a commitment to the affordability agenda that New Yorkers are demanding unite the more than 400 experts we have appointed to our Transition team.\"\n\nIf Vitale and Mallory are any indication of what Mamdani's transition team believes, New York City is in a lot worse trouble than they might suspect.\n\nIt's the holiday season, which means PJ Media VIP's Black Friday sale is back!\n\nNow through Monday evening, 11:59 PM ET, receive 60% OFF an annual VIP, VIP Gold, or VIP Platinum membership with promo code FIGHT.\n\nAlready have a VIP membership?

        "text": "Democratic Boston Mayor Michelle Wu told reporters Monday that she wasn't interested in a \"bromance\" with the Trump administration after New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's friendly meeting with the president. \"I’m not interested in a bromance with the federal regime,\" Wu said, according to The New York Times, which obtained audio from her conversation with reporters on Monday. Mamdani met with the president at the White House on Friday, where President Donald Trump called Mamdani a \"rational person.\" Trump said after the meeting that they both wanted New York City to do well, and the meeting's affable tone drew considerable attention, since both men had traded sharp barbs in recent months. \"From my point of view, flattery is not the way,\" Wu said, according to the Boston Globe. \"I think Boston residents want to stand strong on our values and to get things done and to keep moving forward, and that’s what we’re going to continue to do.\" DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST CALLS MAMDANI'S TRUMP MEETING 'WEAK' AFTER TOUGH CAMPAIGN TALK A Mamdani spokeswoman who was asked about Wu's comments referred to Mamdani's earlier comments about the meeting, where he said he still believed Trump was a threat to democracy, but it was his job as the next mayor to work with \"everyone and anyone\" to improve people's lives, according to the Times. Wu has been outspoken in her criticism of the administration's immigration policy and has defended her city's sanctuary status. \"If it came with a promise to stop snatching residents illegally off the streets, stop prosecuting his political enemies, stop cutting life-saving research and funding?\" she told reporters Monday, according to the Globe. \"Sure, I would be open to a conversation at that point.\" MAMDANI ECONOMIC ADVISOR IS REPARATIONS ACTIVIST WHO SAYS 'DEVALUATION OF BLACK LIVES' INGRAINED IN US SYSTEM Wu accused the Trump administration of being a party that \"doesn’t follow the law\" during a press conference in August. \"At a time when this federal administration is already causing so much fear and harm in our communities, these threats are serious and consequential,\" she said. \"Stop attacking our cities to hide your administration's failures. Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law… You are wrong on the law, and you are wrong on safety.\" Mamdani said after his meeting in the Oval Office that he still believed the president was a fascist. \"Everything that I've said in the past, I continue to believe,\" Mamdani told NBC's Kristen Welker on Sunday.

        "text": "Things appear to be tightening up in a congressional special election between GOP nominee Matt Van Epps and Democrat Aftyn Behn, known as the AOC of Tennessee, in a congressional district that overwhelmingly voted for President Donald Trump. What’s odd is not so much that the race is in question, special elections are always odd and unpredictable birds, but rather, that Behn is a far-left socialist in a part of the country where conventional wisdom says a socialist should have no chance. So why is this happening, and is it a warning sign for Republicans who believe they can sweep the midterms by running against socialism and making New York City Mayor-elect Zohran MamdaniMamdani the face of the Democrats? Behn is the poster child for the loony left. She supports defunding the police to this very day and she has advocated that American women should refuse to have children unless they get demands met by the government. Not only that, an old interview has surfaced in which she said she hates Nashville, the largest city in her district. DNC CHAIR DOWNPLAYS SOCIALIST–MODERATE RIFT AS MAMDANI’S RISE HAS SOME DEMS RATTLED On Tuesday afternoon, I heard Clay Travis, who lives in the district, on his radio show abjectly apoplectic about the support that Behn is receiving. But is it really so strange? I’ve spent much of the past two years traveling across America. One of the rarest types of people I ever meet on the road are moderate, what we used to call, Blue Dog Democrats. The ones I do occasionally meet tend to be over 60. The Democrats I generally encounter aren’t scared of socialism, they tend to like aspects of it, as is borne out in a recent Gallup poll. It found that 66% of Democrats have a positive view of socialism, a number that will only grow as the older, more conservative cohort ages out. DAVID MARCUS: ZANY ZOHRAN ENDORSEMENT IS EXISTENTIAL CHOICE FOR HAKEEM JEFFRIES There are a lot of white 20- and 30-something humanities graduates out there who think they're part of the intellectual upper class, but have $200,000 in student loan debt and can't even dream of buying a home. They're not wrong to think the system is rigged against them, they're just wrong to think socialism can save them. There is also an intense, and by and large successful, effort by Democrats to woo women voters, specifically with policies that appear empathetic, such as no-cash bail, in which the sweet and tender hooligan is coddled, even if it means they go on to commit more crimes. Another argument that falls flat, especially with young Democrats, is \"where has socialism ever worked?\" I recently asked that very question of two guys in Texas, the first said, \"Sweden,\" then the other said, \"Denmark, Finland….\" I hear that a lot, when younger Americans summon a vision of socialism it is not breadlines in Cuba or the former Soviet Union, but, rather, free healthcare and generous vacation benefits in Scandinavia. Finally, the constant polarization of our congressional districts has made red ones more red and blue ones more blue, creating the most target rich environment that socialists have ever had in America. What Republicans need to understand right now is that socialism, as a concept, is not as disqualifying as it once was, or as they still believe it is. If this realization is not made, it's going to be a tough midterm for the GOP. YOUNG PROGRESSIVES LOOK TO ZOHRAN MAMDANI, AOC AS FUTURE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY – UNDER ONE CONDITION This moment feels very much like 2016, when Democrats were licking their chops because Republican voters had chosen the supposedly unelectable Donald Trump as their nominee. We all know how that one turned out. What is essential over the next year is that Republicans put forth ideas that can steal back the affordability issue, which Democrats have seized on, fairly or not, and as the fruits of the Big Beautiful Law spring to life, making sure that advantages such as no tax on overtime or tips are stressed. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Behn does not have to win next week’s special election to amp up the socialist wing of the Democratic Party. Even if she stays within single digits, the far left will use it as a cudgel to insist that socialism can thrive in flyover country. And they might not be wrong. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP The political battle of the next decade in America looks poised to be between socialists on the left and whatever form of Trumpian populism emerges in the president’s wake, including some policies, like the government taking stakes in private businesses that traditional Republicans view as, well, socialist. The most important thing to recognize now is that it is no longer a shock or anomaly when Democrats elect socialists. These days, it's honestly more shocking when they don’t, and no longer just in New York and San Francisco. Don’t expect that to change any time soon. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAVID MARCUS",

        "text": "Socialist Seattle mayor-elect Katie Wilson is prepared to meet with President Donald Trump, should he decide to invite her to the White House. \"I’ll meet with anyone,\" she said, per a Seattle Times report from Tuesday. \"I mean, he’s the president of the United States.\" Wilson, who defeated Democratic Mayor Bruce Harrell in a tight race earlier this month, espouses views similar to New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's, including heftier taxes on the wealthy, government-backed grocery stores and an interest in universal child care. While Mamdani's race received far more national attention, Wilson's ascension in Washington's largest city has significant implications. Mamdani perhaps laid the groundwork for a Trump-Wilson meeting when he met with the president at the White House last week to discuss affordability, public safety and other issues concerning New Yorkers. MAMDANI-STYLE CANDIDATE LIVING OFF PARENTS' MONEY COULD OUSTER INCUMBENT DEM MAYOR Given Mamdani and Trump had traded sharp rhetoric toward each other like \"fascist\" and \"communist,\" their cordial meeting drew considerable attention and also scrutiny from their respective ideological allies. Wilson, however, pushed back against the idea that such meetings constitute \"selling out.\" Rather, she says, they will be important to her success as Seattle's next mayor. SEATTLE'S SOCIALIST MAYOR MAY BE 'LESS CONSTRAINED' THAN MAMDANI, WASHINGTON POST WARNS \"I think that a lot of people on the progressive left do have a sophisticated understanding of what it’s going to take to deliver on a bold progressive agenda, and that it’s not just about only talking to your friends and using the mayor’s office as a soapbox,\" she said, according to The Seattle Times. The outlet noted that Wilson has remained relatively quiet in some regards, however, pointing to her \"necessary meetings\" with people like Gov. Bob Ferguson, D-Wash., and her tendency to turn down national media requests. At the same time, she did not respond when Trump formerly labeled her a \"communist.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Wilson pledged during her campaign to \"Trump-proof\" Seattle and represents a resurgence of socialism, as she and Mamdani — along with national democratic socialist figures like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. — try to push Democrats leftward. Both Wilson and Mamdani put affordability at the forefront of their campaigns, an issue that drove people to the polls in the 2024 presidential election as well. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment. Fox News' Andrew Mark Miller and Alec Schemmel contributed to this report.",

        "text": "This article is part of TPM Cafe, TPM’s home for opinion and news analysis.\n\nFor a lot of young Americans, every major life decision that signifies adulthood starts with the same question: Can I afford it? \n\nCan I afford to move for that “dream job”? Can I afford to get married, have a kid, or take care of one? Can I afford to buy a home, or even just stay in the one I rent? \n\nFor previous generations, those questions had simpler answers.\n\nOlder generations who bought entire homes for the same price as a down payment today often don’t fully grasp what it means to face $2,500 rent, $2,000-a-month childcare, and six-figure student debt — even with a so-called “good job.” \n\nThe divide today isn’t just about money. It’s about agency. The ability to make choices about your own life and to dream about your future was something every generation before us was told was their birthright. \n\nFor millions of young Americans today, that sense of freedom feels out of reach.\n\nThe generational divide of our moment isn’t about partisanship or social issues. It’s about affordability — and how differently each generation experiences what it takes to build a good life.\n\nThat gap shows up in politics, too. You can hear it in how candidates talk about the economy. For the so-called old guard, affordability is something they discuss in abstract terms: inflation, wages, interest rates, the stock market — numbers on a spreadsheet. \n\nFor younger candidates, it’s personal. They don’t have to imagine what it’s like to split rent five ways or watch childcare swallow half a paycheck. They know it — they’re living it.\n\nThey’ve made the same trade-offs: skipping doctors’ appointments because of deductibles, picking up Uber and DoorDash shifts to make ends meet, and delaying milestones their parents or grandparents managed to reach a decade earlier. \n\nThat perspective changes everything.\n\nWhen candidates like Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in New York talk about freezing rent or expanding universal childcare, they’re not being idealistic. They’re naming what’s necessary for people to live full, dignified lives. That’s why young voters flock to leaders like him — because their prescriptions aren’t just policies. They offer permission to hope again. They make the promise — or even concept — of a better future seem attainable.\n\nFor generations that were forced to grow up through a recession, a housing crisis, and a pandemic, that hope isn’t something abstract. It’s a lifeline. \n\nFor too long, young people have been told to tighten their belts, hustle harder, and stop complaining. We’ve been told that if we just worked a little more or spent a little less, we could make it work — as if our economy is a test of character and resilience instead of a system that’s fundamentally broken.\n\nBut this new generation of leaders sees through that lie. They’re not running for office simply to nibble around the edges of the status quo; they’re running to reclaim agency over their own futures. They understand that the promise of America — that hard work and education can buy you stability and choice — has eroded for millions of people. They’re determined to not just make a new promise but to actually keep it this time.\n\nAnd they are living the same realities as the people they hope to represent. Many of them are renters, caregivers, first-generation college graduates, or young people with mountains of student debt (or all of the above), who are campaigning while working second jobs. That authenticity isn’t a branding exercise — it’s simply the truth, and it’s what young voters trust. \n\nThat’s why young people are turning out to vote for them, volunteering for them, and even running themselves at record numbers. More than 75,000 people have reached out to Run for Something since the November 2024 election, and over 5,000 in the week after Zohran Mamdani’s big win. That’s because these candidates offer a vision of a life that feels livable for the first time.\n\nThey’re not just telling young people that a better future is possible — they’re showing what it looks like, through policy and through example.\n\nAnd that’s the thing that gives me hope.\n\nThe affordability crisis may have taken away a lot of our choices, but it hasn’t taken away our will to fight for them. Every young leader stepping up right now — in city councils, state legislatures and, yes, mayors’ offices — is proving that this generation isn’t apathetic. We just want a fair shot at the same stability our parents had.\n\nMaybe that’s what older generations don’t quite see yet: young people aren’t asking for anything radical. We’re just asking for the space to build our lives — and maybe even dream a little, too",

        "text": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent sang praises of New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani (D) on Tuesday following the surprisingly cordial meeting with President Trump on Friday at the White House.\n\nAppearing on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Bessent made positive remarks about Mamdani after co-host Andrew Ross Sorkin said he was curious to hear the treasury secretary’s reaction to the meeting that took place after Trump and Mamdani traded public barbs at each other for months. \n\nBessent, who said he attended the meeting between the democratic socialist and Trump, told Sorkin, “You’ve got to have some admiration for a candidate who ran a campaign the way he did... It was a great, great campaign.”\n\nDeclaring that Mamdani is “clearly the leader of the Democratic Party now,” Bessent continued, “and I think it speaks to how open-minded the president is that he invited him into the Oval [Office].” \n\nBessent, a Republican, argued that Trump “wants the best for New Yorkers” before slyly sliding in a jab against Mamdani, calling him “a young man with a lot of old ideas that have never worked.”\n\n“It’s easy to run a campaign, but the practical everyday of keeping people safe, picking up the trash, making the subways run on time — we’ll see,” Bessent added. \n\nOn Friday, Mamdani and Trump appeared jovial at the highly anticipated meeting, smiling and laughing together as they vowed to work together to address New York City’s affordability and housing crisis. \n\nAt one point, Mamdani was asked during the meeting if he still thinks Trump is a “fascist.” Before he could respond, the president interjected, telling him, “That’s OK, you can just say ‘yes’. It’s easier than explaining it, I don’t mind.”\n\n“OK, yes,” the mayor-elect responded with a grin as Trump smiled back and patted him on his arm.\n\nOver the weekend, Mamdani was asked yet again whether he thinks Trump is a fascist during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\nMamdani didn’t back down. \n\n“That’s something that I’ve said in the past. I say it today,” he told the outlet. “And I think what I appreciated about the conversation that I had with the president was that we were not shy about the places of disagreement, about the politics that has brought us to this moment.’ \n\nMamdani added, “And we also wanted to focus on what it could look like to deliver on a shared analysis of an affordability crisis for New Yorkers.”\n\nWatch Bessent’s appearance on CNBC below.",

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) from the House, Kang argues \"we are in the middle of a quietly revolutionary moment in this country, which began with the pandemic and the protests stemming from the murder of George Floyd by a police officer.\"\n\n\"The subsequent unrest has taken on a variety of forms, including a continued and drastic decline in trust of the traditional news media and attacks on universities from both the left and the right,\" he adds. \n\nThat unrest, he writes, \"was also channeled into Trump’s 2024 campaign, which was less about any one issue than it was about a renewed and utterly hollow promise to drain the swamp all over again.\"\n\nThe Epstein scandal has provided \"a single theory of the world\" that didn't rely on partisan leanings to feed that \"insurrectionary energy,\" Kang writes.\n\n\"Epstein has provided that. Lest we forget, Epstein died more than six years ago now, and although the story certainly had not been forgotten by the public, it had at least been moved to a low-heat back burner when Greene; Thomas Massie, a U.S. representative from Kentucky; and a handful of other politicians began to talk about the Epstein files again,\" he says.\n\nKang says that a little over a month ago, he wrote that \"on Planet Epstein, everything that happens — the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the war in Gaza, the suppression of speech by the Trump Administration — serves as proof that the country is run by blackmail, pedophilia and fealty to Israel.\"\n\n\"I do not think very many Americans buy into every part of that story, and I imagine that a great number would be rightfully appalled by the implicit and explicit antisemitism in this view of the world,\" he added.\n\nNow, Kang says, \"In hindsight, I fear that I might have undersold the number of Americans who do believe all those things.\"\n\nRising from the \"Epstein mess,\" Kang writes, is Greene, whose \"sudden resignation only adds another chapter to the conspiracy narrative on Planet Epstein.\"\n\n\"America loves righteous defectors, and her turn away from Trump — along with her newly measured tone when speaking in big-time media interviews or, last week, in front of the Capitol, flanked with Epstein survivors — turned someone who was an embarrassment into one of the more formidable members of the House of Representatives,\" Kang notes.\n\nAnd while Kang doubts that \"Greene, freed from Congress, and in spite of her past nuttiness and humiliations,\" will \"become the magnet who pulls together the populist right and the populist,\" he does expect her to run for president with \"someone from the insurrectionary left as her running mate.\"\n\n\"Such a campaign would certainly feature a lot of talk about Epstein and Israel, and would likely call for a new vision of the country that did away with what Greene called traitors who serve “foreign countries and themselves,\" Kang muses.\n\nAs for how such a ticket would fare against more mainstream politicians on either side, Kang says not very well, probably, because \"political inertia and the two-party system are still powerful forces, despite the Epstein revolution that’s taking place on every smartphone in the country.\"\n\nWhatever does ensue, Kang writes, he is certain that \"political life after Trump will be defined by odd ideological pairings that do not follow the political lines of the past twenty years. An abrupt realignment now feels more probable than endless polarization.\"\n\n\"Some of the surprises that result from this realignment, such as [NYC mayor elect Zohran] Mamdani’s unlikely victory, will surely cause both hope and fear, as people grapple with the unexpected. But I do not think that we can fully predict the alliances to come, nor the new order they will bring,\" he concludes.",

        "text": "Trump designates Muslim Brotherhood as an FTO: Certain chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood will be designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists per an executive order signed by President Trump on Monday. The Muslim Brotherhood was founded in 1928 in Egypt as a Sunni Islamic organization aiming to gain political power. It exists today as a collection of loosely affiliated Islamic chapters, some directly associated with other Islamic terrorist organizations such as Hamas. Designating the Muslim Brotherhood as an FTO allows the U.S. to go after the organization’s U.S.-based finances, conduct military intel, and prosecute those who offer “material support” to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nRubio rolls back DEI, State employees cheer: Despite the negative reporting surrounding Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s efforts to expunge woke DEI ideology from the State Department, it turns out that even the department’s leftist employees appreciate a commitment to meritocracy over race-based favoritism. Since Rubio has thrown out the Biden-era DEIA category for evaluating overall work proficiency and offered restitution to some 295 employees who were marked down for failing to show they would “seek diversity in staff,” and thereby denied promotion, a number of employees who self-identify as “leftist” have praised Rubio. As one employee wrote, “I am very happy for everyone who is getting promoted after throwing out the ludicrous DEIA score. It is well deserved.”\n\nMeta and sex-trafficking minors: “You could incur 16 violations for prostitution and sexual solicitation, and upon the 17th violation, your account would be suspended,” testified Instagram’s former head of safety and well-being, Vaishnavi Jayakumar, in a recently unsealed court filing. The plaintiffs in the case against Meta allege that the company was well aware that its products were being used by adult strangers to contact minors, yet downplayed the issue and refused to take corrective action. The problem has been made public before; while testifying before Congress last year, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced the audience and apologized to the victims of child exploitation on his platform after being berated by Senator Josh Hawley. The current lawsuit alleges that Meta “pursued a strategy of growth at all costs,” ignoring the issue and possibly lying to Congress about its knowledge of it.\n\n2028 Dem primary and ranked-choice voting: A number of Democrats are promoting the dubious ranked-choice voting scheme following its success in making Zohran Mamdani the Democrat candidate in the New York City mayoral race. Some Democrats are advocating for adopting ranked-choice voting for the 2028 presidential primaries. They see it as a popular way to get out the vote, claiming it helps prevent the perception that people’s votes are “wasted.” Not everyone is sold, however, as a number of states and municipalities that have experimented with ranked-choice have since reverted to the fairer single-vote method. For the DNC to adopt ranked-choice voting, it would require a majority of the 450-member body to approve new rules and bylaws. Furthermore, individual state parties would need to approve the change, and on top of that, a number of state governments would have to amend their election laws.",

        "text": "Unveiling in Illinois we see the signature of modern political gaslighting and moral posturing without moral clarity. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson both engage in performative indignation; they feign outrage, sling accusations and vilify opponents, anything to avoid offering solutions, being accountable for results or admitting the truth.\n\nPritzker rarely misses a chance to compare President Donald Trump, his administration, and even his supporters to Hitler’s Nazis. He does so while invoking his role as a major financial backer of the Illinois Holocaust Museum, as though his philanthropy grants him moral license to define who the “real Nazis” are.\n\nBut Pritzker has remained nearly silent when antisemitism originates from his own party’s far-left flank – where hatred of Jews now masquerades as “resistance” and “liberation.” When demonstrations erupted on college campuses and city streets rejecting Israel’s right to exist or defend itself, Pritzker chose to preserve his political standing rather than call out antisemitism. Because condemnation risked alienating the activist base he needs for his future political ambitions, Pritzker turned a blind eye to preserve his standing. (RELATED: JB Pritzker Said Cashless Bail Would Keep Cities Safe — Then A Woman Was Burned Alive)\n\nWhen antisemitic rhetoric and behavior emerged from Chicago’s municipal leadership in October 2023, Pritzker again offered little more than disapproval, focusing attention elsewhere. Meanwhile, members of the Chicago Teachers Union organized rallies supporting a Gaza “cease-fire,” antisemitic social media posts surfaced among city leaders, including the CPS Board of Education’s president, and even Johnson called Israel’s military response “genocidal,” equating the Palestinian cause with movements for Black liberation.\n\nEven as New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani claimed headlines, Pritzker has been silent on Mamdani’s focused targeting of Israel, calls to boycott and refusal to criticize Hamas for their Oct. 7 attack.\n\nYet while shielding the extremes within his own coalition, Pritzker has intensified his attacks on Trump, repeatedly likening his policies to those found in Nazi Germany. The truth is it’s about politics, not what’s good or right; dehumanization is a tool to be used for political capital.\n\nUnfortunately, Pritzker is not alone in this hypocrisy – not even in Illinois.\n\nJohnson has learned the script as well.\n\nHis words disguise that his own actions harm the very populations he claims to champion.\n\nWhile directing hundreds of millions of dollars toward migrant relief – over $200 million — Johnson cut police resources from Black neighborhoods and CPS schools that wanted and relied on them. His budgets brought police 2,000 below full staff, while violent crimes in Chicago soared to over 28,000 instances in 2024. He sided with the CTU in blocking public school choice and charter school expansion, trapping low-income children in failing neighborhood schools. Johnson’s investments provided $324 million in subsidies to politically connected developers in exchange for only 505 affordable housing units. He raised the subminimum wage for tipped workers and doubled family leave requirements for private businesses – moves that disproportionately burden small and minority-owned businesses.\n\nAll the while, he claims Trump, his supporters, and even his critics in Chicago want to “return to the Jim Crow South.” And his warning to Mamdani was to be aware of “relentless opposition,” as if failing policies weren’t the problem.\n\nThese Illinois leaders preach “equity” while presiding over one of the nation’s most inequitable states: Illinois ranks among the highest in taxes yet among the worst in racial and economic equity. It is moral cowardice masquerading as caution.\n\nTheir antics work in one clear way: it’s increased their political visibility. Recent polling shows Johnson showed an uptick in favorability in October, after a month of visible and televised attacks on Trump for his focus on Chicago. Johnson’s 30% approval – low compared to most other major politicians – is an increase from a record-low 7% earlier this year. At the same time, Pritzker has been making the rounds on the national stage, becoming viral on social media and going as far as interviewing with Fox News’ Bret Baier. It was only in August that Illinoisans were split 50-50 on their approval of Pritzker.\n\nThe more these leaders provoke presidential backlash, and name drop Trump, the more they can posture before cameras as martyrs of “the resistance.” Meanwhile, Chicago and Illinois taxpayers, commuters and families absorb the cost and struggle without help.\n\nWhen elected officials equate their opponents with Nazis, their police with the Gestapo, or opposition sympathizers with the old Confederacy, they destroy the shared moral vocabulary that keeps a democracy intact. Their words invite confrontation. Their rhetoric radicalizes the margins. And the activists who respond are not seeking reform; they’re engineering chaos.\n\nThis is not leadership. It is political theater performed at the expense of public trust and civic stability. While Pritzker and Johnson polish their resistance credentials, ordinary residents face rising taxes, violence, and asymmetrical inequality.\n\nIllinois deserves serious solutions and accountability, not showmanship. Real leaders don’t gaslight their constituents, they serve them.\n\nPaul Vallas is a policy advisor to the Illinois Policy Institute and was the first CEO of Chicago Public Schools.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

        "text": "New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani disclosed what happened during his White House meeting with President Donald Trump last week.\n\nThe democratic socialist, when asked about the “weirdest” thing he spotted during the visit in an appearance on “The Adam Friedland Show,” said he was sitting down and waiting for his meeting with the president when he saw “all these different coffee table books” in front of him.\n\n“One of them is ‘UFC at the White House,’” said Mamdani, adding that he had “no idea” about the mixed martial arts event set to take place on the South Lawn in June. “I was just flipping through that.”\n\nMamdani, when asked by Friedland if he saw photos of guys fighting each other in the book, noted that it was just a visualization of what the UFC’s octagon-shaped cage arena would look like on the South Lawn.\n\nThe event — which Trump first teased in July as part of America’s 250th anniversary celebration — is expected to include fighter weigh-ins at the Lincoln Memorial and is scheduled to coincide with the president’s 80th birthday on June 14, 2026.\n\nUFC President and CEO Dana White — in an interview with Fox News in September — revealed that the seating capacity for the event would be around 5,000, citing security concerns. This marks a notable drop from Trump’s initial estimate of up to 25,000 spectators.\n\nWhite, who has endorsed Trump since his 2016 campaign, has also claimed that a park near the White House could host 85,000 people to watch the event on TV screens. He told Sports Business Journal in October that his company would pay $700,000 to replace the White House lawn after the event.\n\nFriedland asked Mamdani whether he was planning to attend the event.\n\n“No,” replied Mamdani with a chuckle.",

        "text": "New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's smile carried him a long way toward being elected. And he used his affability again on Friday, turning the meeting he had requested with President Donald Trump into an Oval Office lovefest.\n\nNow it's time for the mayor-elect to employ the power of smiling to make day-to-day life better for New Yorkers when they are compelled to interact with city employees. Mamdani needs to call on the 300,000 city employees to show warmth, respect, and courtesy to the public. The spirit of a smile.\n\nWalk into a city agency or court building seeking help, and you're likely to get barked at and herded like a dumb animal. Ask a Metropolitan Transportation Authority employee why the train isn't coming, and you're apt to hear, \"Can't you read the sign?\" followed by a muttered \"dumb f--k.\" It's a bruising experience.\n\nI went to family court at 111 Centre Street last Thursday to be appointed as a guardian for a 95-year-old woman, bed-bound in a nursing home. Arriving at the appointed time of 9:30 a.m., I found 80 people in a line snaking around the outside of the building, waiting to enter and go through the one available metal scanner.\n\nI inched ahead in the line until I was third from the entrance. A burly man in a guard uniform suddenly came through the door, held his arm horizontally in front of me, and yelled an order for all of us to turn around and proceed to the entrance at the back of the building. Everyone who had made it to the front of the line would now be at the back of the line. I calmly said \"no,\" and that I had waited once and would like to enter, and I started to walk around him to the door. He held his arm out to stop me and barked his order again, adding, \"Do you think you're someone special?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, adding below my breath, \"We are human beings.\" I pushed my way around him and into the building, taking the two women behind me in as well.\n\nThe fact is, everyone in that line deserved dignified treatment -- but that's not the treatment being meted out by employees at 111 Centre Street.\n\nWhen I got upstairs, I took a seat outside Judge Ilana Marcus's courtroom. Noon arrived, and I still hadn't been called. I pulled open the courtroom door a crack to see if the elderly patient's case was still being discussed.\n\nAt that point, a court guard pushed through the door, screamed at me for opening the door, and refused to answer any questions about whether I was even in the right hallway. When I tried to speak, she shut me down.\n\nThat's how people too often are treated in city agencies and courtrooms. And it's reflected in the low ratings New Yorkers give city services. Only 27% rate them overall good or excellent, reports the Citizens Budget Commission, though New Yorkers give high ratings to fire protection and garbage collection.\n\nBut if you want to see nastiness, visit the McCarren public pool in Brooklyn. As one swimmer commented, \"The attendants in the ladies' room are definitely from a prison movie.\"\n\nThe quality of public services and their delivery were barely mentioned in the many months of mayoral campaigning, with the candidates battling instead over Trump and the fate of Gaza.\n\nTo the extent Mamdani discussed quality of life in the city, he reduced it to one word: \"dignity.\" He said, \"A life of dignity should not be reserved for the fortunate few.\"\n\nBut he talked about only one way of restoring dignity: the government's role in helping working people afford child care or a decent place to live.\n\n\"No New Yorker should ever be priced out of anything they need to survive. ... It is government's job to deliver that dignity.\"\n\nChild care and groceries cost money, but on day one, Mamdani can go a long way toward helping New Yorkers feel dignified in this hardscrabble city by asking them to be treated with civility.\n\nMamdani should announce a dignity campaign, calling on public employees to treat all of us with civility instead of herding us like animals and barking instructions at us.\n\nHe should take a page out of the 99th mayor's playbook. Former Mayor Fiorello La Guardia approached a group of city officials incognito and waited while they ignored him. When one of them finally said something, La Guardia shouted back, \"Take off your hat when you speak to a citizen,\" as he knocked the hat off the worker's head.\n\nToday, that would be going too far. Working rules forbid it. But in the 1990s, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani also called for more civility from public employees.\n\nThe New York City Police Department had its \"Courtesy, Professionalism, Respect\" motto. That should be the code of conduct citywide.\n\nTarget is mandating that its in-store workers smile and make eye contact with shoppers. That's good business.

        "text": "Late-night hosts discussed Donald Trump’s strangely friendly meeting with New York’s mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.\n\nSeth Meyers\n\nSeth Meyers devoted his Monday Closer Look segment to the bizarrely friendly White House meeting between Donald Trump and New York’s mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, where the president seemed downright pleased to be meeting the Democratic socialist that his administration has long demonized.\n\n“He looks like a five-year-old meeting Mickey Mouse,” said an amused Meyers. Though Trump had previously called Mamdani a “communist” and a “total nutjob” the president seemed charmed by the 34-year-old mayor.\n\n“I’ve never seen Trump this smitten before,” the Late Night host said. “This is a reminder: he doesn’t work with a single cool person! He is surrounded by so many charmless goons that the first time he got to hang out with someone that had a little charisma, he swooned like he was on a date with the varsity quarterback.\n\n“You’d have stars in your eyes too if you spent every day of your life with joyless gargoyles like Stephen Miller and JD Vance, and then you met a 34-year-old social media star who rapped in a halal cart and once appeared in an actual Disney movie,” he added.\n\nMeyers then trained on arguably the most surprising moment of the Oval Office meeting: when Trump interjected as Mamdani was asked about previously calling the president a fascist. “That’s OK, you can just say, ‘Yes.’ OK? It’s easier – it’s easier than explaining it. I don’t mind,” Trump said while patting Mamdani on the arm.\n\n“That is the flirtiest I’ve ever heard anyone say, ‘You can call me a fascist,’” Meyers joked, before breaking out his Trump impression: “You can call me a fascist, you can call me – I’ll be whatever you want me to be!”\n\n“Of course, it won’t be remotely surprising if Trump changes his tune,” he concluded. “We’ve seen it happen many times before. But the one takeaway that will last is that all the Maga scare tactics evaporated. The right thought meeting Trump would be Zohran’s worst nightmare, but it turns out meeting Zohran was Trump’s dream come true.”\n\nJimmy Kimmel\n\nAnd in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel celebrated his frequent target Marjorie Taylor Greene’s resignation from Congress, after a falling-out with Trump. “Yet another Trump superfan learns that loyalty to him goes only one way,” he laughed.\n\nIn a message to her constituents, Greene said she found that Congress was beholden to the supremely wealthy and ignores the needs of ordinary Americans. “She says her party has no plan for healthcare, and that the Jeffrey Epstein files are not a hoax that the president claims they are – to which I say, welcome to reality, Marge,” said Kimmel. “We’re glad to have you here. Make yourself at home, and feel free to check out our science wing while you have a chance.\n\n“Marjorie is out and Mamdani is in,” he added, referring to Trump’s “highly unlikely Friendsgiving on Friday at the White House” with Mamdani. “Most people were expecting fireworks,” he said, “but they did not expect them to be the Katy Perry kind.”\n\n“They have the vibe of a wealthy elderly gay man at the Cheesecake Factory ordering his shy young boyfriend dessert,” Kimmel said of the chummy affair.\n\nTrump, to Kimmel’s shock, lavished Mamdani with praise, saying, among other things: “He really ran an incredible race, and I congratulated him,” “it’s an amazing thing that he did,” “I think you’re going to have hopefully a really great mayor, and the better he does, the happier I am” and “I feel very confident that he’s going to do a great job.”\n\n“What a turn of events!” Kimmel exclaimed. “It was like he was giving a wedding toast to his new son-in-law. It’s almost as if, and I know this sounds crazy – it’s almost as if Trump doesn’t have any real political convictions at all. He just says whatever, whenever.”\n\nOf Trump’s physical displays of affection for the young mayor, Kimmel added: “He touched him more in that press conference that he’s touched Melania all year.”\n\nThe unlikely alliance left heads spinning in Maga world. “They had to unplug and reboot Sean Hannity five times after this,” Kimmel chuckled. “This is how upside-down this crop of Maga-teers is: they’re mad at Trump, some of them are furious at Trump, because he was friendly with the new mayor of New York. Last week, he had a big celebratory dinner for the Saudi prince whose goons dismembered a columnist for the Washington Post? No problem. This? Too much.\n\n“Anybody who’s surprised that Trump got along with Mamdani should not be surprised,” he concluded. “Trump loves when famous people come to visit.”",

But it would clearly be a massive undertaking.\n\nThe new telecommunication system must support 150,000 staffers in 1,800 schools serving 900,000 students, as well as outreach to parents, meaning multilingual features would have to be part of any plan.\n\nThe telecom overhaul would likely take place under Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s administration.\n\nThe move comes as New York schools banned use of personal cell phones during class periods, an edict approved by Gov. Kathy Hochul.",

        "text": "Democrats love violence and lawlessness. Attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers continue to increase, and we know where the blame lies.\n\nIn a Nov. 24 press release, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that compared to last year, attacks on ICE officers are up 1,153%. Between Jan. 21 and Nov. 21 last year, there were 19 assaults on ICE. During the same period this year, there were 238. Meanwhile, Democrats in government, media, and business continue to spread egregious lies about and smears against ICE.\n\nThe real-world consequences are devastating. “After months of Democrat politicians comparing ICE to Nazis, the gestapo, slave patrols, and even encouraging illegal aliens to resist arrest, our brave ICE law enforcement have been assaulted 238 times,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. She referred to just some of the weapons used:\n\nOur law enforcement officers have had Molotov cocktails and rocks thrown at them, been shot at, had cars used as weapons against them, and been physically assaulted. Sanctuary politicians need to tone the rhetoric down before a law enforcement officer is killed. They should be thanking these brave law enforcement officers who risk their lives every single day to arrest pedophiles, rapists, murderers, gang members, and terrorists from our neighborhoods.\n\nRelated: Biden Admin Pressured Airports to House Illegal Aliens\n\nICE shared a photo of an ICE officer who was seriously injured on his face when Salvadoran illegal Walter Leonel Perez Rodriguez attacked him with a metal coffee cup.\n\nICE Officer Brutally Attacked by Illegal Alien PedophileSalvadoran illegal Walter Leonel Perez Rodriguez \"struck an ICE officer in the face with a metal coffee cup, causing a laceration to the officer’s lip resulting in 13 stitches and burns to the side of his face,\" DHS says pic.twitter.com/pkF8xLkP8p— Border Hawk (@BorderHawkNews) November 6, 2025\n\nThe DHS press release also included other examples of attacks on federal law enforcement, including the Tren de Aragua gang member who attempted to murder an officer and the illegal alien who threw a Molotov cocktail at officers during the riots in Los Angeles. And, of course, there was the terrorist attack at the Dallas ICE facility, which resulted in the death of a detainee.\n\nOver the last 10 months, federal officers and agents across the DHS enterprise have faced a dangerously escalating pattern of violence, ranging from hitting, spitting, kicking and biting during arrests, to vehicle ramming, open gun fire, and the throwing of Molotov cocktails. These nationwide incidents show how ICE officers are being targeted because of the badge they wear, not just the enforcement operations they execute on behalf of the American people.\n\nMultiple Antifa members recently admitted to terrorist activities in connection with a different attack on a Texas ICE facility, which almost resulted in the death of an officer. They had the dubious honor of becoming the first Antifa members convicted of terrorism since Donald Trump so designated Antifa.\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, New York Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, and Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) are just a few of the Democrats whose outrageous lies about ICE have fueled the violence.\n\nEditor’s Note: Support and follow PJ Media’s coverage of breaking news and Democrat corruption.

This was not the script. It was completely out of the blue... and concerning,” the White House insider said, according to Wolff. \n\nThe person added, “This wasn’t just losing the plot. This was like a different guy. The look in his eyes was crazy.”\n\nWolff said White House staff had expected Trump to project a “message of dominance and submission” in his presser with Mamdani, whom the president had previously trashed as a “communist lunatic” and threatened to arrest and deport.\n\nInstead, a fawning Trump said he would “absolutely” feel “comfortable” living in Mamdani’s city, defended him against the right’s “jihadist” label, and pledged to help the new democratic socialist mayor do a “good job.” \n\nAccording to Wolff, his White House source told him, “The only explanation was that the guy forgot who he is—so weird,” confessing, “It gives you a 25th Amendment shiver.”\n\nThe 25th Amendment affords the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet the power to declare the president unfit if he is no longer able to perform his duties. \n\nQuestions about Trump’s mental and physical fitness have long fueled online debate about invoking the amendment. But in recent weeks, as cracks have appeared in the elderly president’s grip on the MAGA movement amid struggles to deliver on his campaign promises, even some MAGA loyalists have called on JD Vance, 41, to take action.\n\nWhen reached for comment, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told the Daily Beast, “Michael Wolff is a lying sack of s--t and has been proven to be a fraud. He routinely fabricates stories originating from his sick and warped imagination, only possible because he has a severe and debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his peanut-sized brain.”\n\nWolff said the White House had greeted Mamdani’s victory in America’s largest city earlier this month as a welcome opportunity to create a “perfect enemy” who would act as a foil to Trump.\n\n“It just fit every category that they needed until he comes to the White House and becomes the model citizen for Donald Trump’s new world,” Wolff observed. \n\n“What about the idea that somehow Trump is playing three-dimensional chess?” Coles questioned.\n\n“I’m glad you asked,” Wolff responded, explaining that the White House insider had told him, “He doesn’t play 3-D chess. He has one game, and this wasn’t it.” \n\nWolff, who Trump allowed behind the scenes of the White House for nine months during his first term, noted that the former reality TV star usually wants to project a “dominant” and “angry” persona—but not around Mamdani. \n\n“Trump is so good at playing the role, but he clearly was... out of character playing a different role,” Wolff said. “And the view of this person [in the White House] and people around Trump was that they had no explanation for what was going on here.”\n\nMamdani walked out of the White House sit-down having scored a political win. Trump on Saturday backed down from sending federal troops into the city—a significant reversal of his previous stance to “clean up the crime” and “save New York City”—saying he would do so “if they need it.”",

Kathy Hochul Tuesday over a member of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s transition team who has voiced support for infamous cop killers.\n\nBlack Nationalist Lumumba Bandele was picked to serve on the incoming mayor’s Committee on Community Organizing on Monday despite previously aligning with Black Liberation Army members convicted of killing police officers in the tristate area.\n\nStefanik, a Republican looking to run against Hochul in next year’s election, quickly blasted the decision and called on Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul to pressure Mamdani to push Bandele aside. \n\n“Kathy Hochul’s endorsed Mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, just picked a man who supports the killers of cops in New York and New Jersey to serve on his transition team,” she said in a statement to The Post.\n\n“Mamdani’s vision for New York is getting very clear and it’s starting to look like a nightmare. Kathy Hochul must immediately call on Mamdani to fire Lumumba Bandele from his transition team.”\n\nBandele, now of the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement, attended a rally pushing for Herman Bell’s release from prison in March 2018, according to the Workers World newspaper after Bell and two others lured two NYPD officers to a Harlem housing project and then gunned them down in 1971.\n\nBell was ultimately granted his freedom in 2018 after the parole board found he was reformed and remorseful over the sickening crime.\n\nBandele also mentioned how he met several times with Assata Shakur, who escaped from prison while serving a life sentence for killing a New Jersey cop and fled to Cuba, where she was granted political asylum.\n\nHe offered praise in a video earlier this month and talked about their longtime relationship.\n\nShakur, who died in September, shot and killed a New Jersey state trooper during a gunfight in 1973. \n\nBandele saluted Shakur and Bell on Veterans Day 2024 as among the “many soldiers that served valiantly in the people’s military to defend our communities.”\n\nMamdani’s transition campaign and Hochul’s office did not immediately reply to messages seeking comment.\n\nA message was also not immediately returned by Bandele.\n\nHe is one of more than 400 community members and stakeholders to sit on 17 transition committees before Mamdani takes office in January.",

Of course, Swedes then went all in on mass migration, which has turned it into one of the rape capitals of the world and Western Europe's bombing capital, but that is a different story. \n\nNo, Mamdani really is a communist with a pretty smile. If you doubt how awful Mamdani and his circle are, read John's piece from earlier today. If he were the leader of a revolutionary movement who captured the city by force, he would try to turn it into Cuba or Venezuela and blame all the trouble on Trump. \n\nHere's one of his transition advisors:\n\n🚨 Mamdani Transition Pick: “Police Are a Direct Interference” With “Radical Socialist Oriented Politics”… and “They Will Be Used to Stop Us”Professor Alex Vitale, now on Mamdani’s transition team, says the quiet part out loud, admitting that abolishing the police “creates… pic.twitter.com/3wFicpmxIU— Stu Smith (@thestustustudio) November 25, 2025\n\nHis policy advisors range from some bureaucrats who are willing to work with whoever is their boss to Marxists who would put you up against a wall if they could. He has a radical agenda and will, to the extent possible, try to implement it. And even if he can't check off his wish list through diktats, he can rearrange regulations to implement his policies in the longer term. \n\nZorhan Mamdani says the quiet part out loud,Under Mamdani, if there is a 'bad landlord' the city is going to take over and seize the propertypic.twitter.com/je3V5OTfbV— Defiant L’s (@DefiantLs) November 8, 2025\n\nGuess who gets to decide what defines a bad landlord?

We can do that person-to-person organizing of our daily lives and our living spaces and our working spaces.”Pod mapping is the idea that small circles of friends or neighbors should take over crisis response themselves — a DIY mutual-aid system where ordinary people handle emergencies instead of trained professionals, police, or even social workers.“If we’re going to get police out of our lives… it’s also about doing that hard interpersonal work in our everyday lives.”\n\nAlready, Kathy Hochul is signaling she won't sign off on tax increases or free buses, and Mamdani will face constraints that he brushed over in a campaign filled with grand promises and no plan to fulfill them. He is a salesman and doesn't understand how the government or the legal system works. \n\nAnd, amusingly enough, Mamdani has already had to kiss Trump's ring. That must have been fun for him. \n\nThere are areas where he can do great damage—for instance, the mayor has a great deal of power over the education system in New York, and obviously, the police force. I suspect he will do great damage quickly in the former, even if the consequences take a while to manifest themselves in a system that already works rather poorly. \n\nIn the latter? Mamdani will do real damage to public safety, but with 34,000 police and a lot of momentum in the system, the damage will take longer than you expect and last longer than anybody who tries to clean up his mess will want to deal with. \n\nAdam Smith famously said, \"There is a great deal of ruin in a nation,” by which he meant that the bad consequences that are foreseeable will take longer to destroy a polity than you would expect. We see that often enough. How many of us have expected the US monetary system to collapse due to mounting debt? No doubt, at some point, it will, unless we straighten up and fly right. \n\nBut who knows when? The US is still a great place to invest, has a skilled workforce, an unmatched military, and everywhere else is worse. So it continues. \n\nI suspect that New York City is much the same. Mamdani's policies will harm the city grievously, but I suspect it is so vital that it will plod along doing pretty well, with Mamdani throwing a lot of sand in the gears without creating either a communist utopia as he promises, or a communist hell we all fear. \n\nI'm not shrugging. It's horrible that he won, and he will make things worse. But I have this sense that New York City is too big and strong to kill, at least not in the short term. I get the sense that he is like a lone lion attacking an elephant. Not good. The elephant may get some damage, but unless a substantial pride attacks, the elephant is likely to survive the experience with only some scars. \n\nI hope that New York City is more a herd of elephants than one roaming alone, and that Mamdani's pride of lions is not as great as they believe. I suspect, and believe, that New York City will outlast even a communist mayor. Scarred, maybe badly, but it's hard to kill.\n\nEditor’s Note: Every single day, here at Hot Air, we will stand up and FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT against the radical left and deliver the conservative reporting our readers deserve.

        "text": "President Donald Trump’s exceedingly warm reception of New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani at the White House last week left observers attempting to decipher what it all meant. To longtime Trump watchers, it showed the popularity-hungry president responding to a charismatic winner; to one anti-monopolist, it showed a potential alliance between left and right populists; to a hyperlocal New York newspaper, it showed two men from Queens getting together. To South Asians and third culture kids, the encounter showed an immigrant son of the Indian diaspora flexing a very familiar and particular skill — one likely honed over years of uncomfortable interactions with paternalistic elders. “Desis have found Mamdani’s polite smile, respectful head tilt and general mollifying of Trump kick in a very particular muscle memory – of tactical deference to Aunties and Uncles whose lectures they actually have zero intention of obeying,” Times of India journalists opined in a recent editorial, referring to people with roots in the Indian subcontinent. “What Zohran did was not extraordinary statesmanship or youthful rebellion but simply the oldest trick in our collective cultural book, the desi art of letting the elder talk while quietly keeping the steering wheel of our own intent,” Indian diarist Kedar Gadgil mused on LinkedIn. “We’re disruptors, but we are managing to maintain respect for our elders. We’re learning how to play into the system that has raised us,” Yamuna Meleth, an actor and singer who was raised in Alabama by Indian immigrants, said in an interview. “I think that is Desi training.” CNN reached out to Mamdani’s team to ask about this assessment. But whether Mamdani perfected this art as a result of his immigrant upbringing, whether it was meticulous preparation on behalf of his staff or whether he simply caught the previously hostile president in a good mood is besides the point. Fellow South Asians saw something familiar in Mamdani’s Oval Office demeanor: his uncharacteristically subdued smile, his respectful yet uncompromising tone and his deft deflections of questions intended to highlight his and Trump’s fundamental disagreements. Meleth said Mamdani’s behavior toward Trump reminded her of fielding unsolicited advice from aunties and uncles growing up. “There is a patience that is instilled in you and a sort of acceptance, almost like you’re trained to let it go in one ear and out the other,” she added. The trick, in her experience, is “letting them gas you up and to let them think that they have something to do with your success.” In his meeting with the president, Mamdani appeared to do just that. When asked if New York City loved Trump, he immediately pivoted to his signature message about affordability while acknowledging that New Yorkers shifted toward Trump in 2024 because of his campaign’s focus on cost of living. Trump, in turn, seemed delighted at the media’s interest in the meeting and tried to play up their perceived similarities. “Some of his ideas really are the same ideas that I have,” he said at one point. At another, “I want him to do a great job, and we’ll help him do a great job.” As Mamdani faced criticism from some on the left for meeting with Trump, others praised what they saw as the mayor-elect’s ability to disarm a notoriously contentious figure without getting defensive or compromising his values. In doing so, he undercut the right’s attempt to paint him as a communist jihadist and tamped down fears of the National Guard being deployed to New York City — at least for now. Gadgil likened this ability to a dance that South Asians are especially practiced in. “Eventually you start leading without the other person realizing that you were following just a moment ago,” he said. “To an outsider, it looks like a very choreographed piece.” Afshana Haque, a Houston-based therapist who specializes in South Asian clients, characterized Mamdani’s dynamic with Trump as “very similar to how we navigate maybe aunties at a party telling us about who to marry and what color their skin should be and what career to have, and yet being polite about it.” While Western societies tend to favor clear, direct communication, Haque said non-Western cultures often view such explicitness as disrespectful, meaning people with roots in those cultures learn to strike a delicate balance between appeasing a difficult elder and staying true to oneself. “Growing up, for many of us, it was very upsetting, annoying, frustrating that we even had to do that. It takes a lot of mental energy and emotional energy at times,” Haque said. “But what is so beautiful about all of this is seeing how these can be strengths for us and can help us navigate worlds.” Mamdani’s charm offensive on Trump was notable considering the confrontational turns that the president’s meetings with other high-profile leaders have taken. In February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s White House visit escalated into a shouting match, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance chiding him for not being sufficiently grateful for US support in the country’s war against Russia. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Oval Office appearance in May ended in a similar ambush as Trump tried to falsely accuse him of enabling white genocide. One way of understanding all of these interactions might be that Trump is acting in his own political interest, and that striking a friendly tone with Mamdani last week was the most advantageous maneuver at the time. But for many South Asian observers, the uncle disarmament strategy is not to be dismissed.",

A man who took over that room as no one before him has ever taken over that room with Donald Trump in it.”\n\nO’Donnell was referring to Trump’s Friday meetup with his political opponent Mamdani, whom he’s continuously slammed as “communist” in the past, at least until now. Both of the politicians have gone back and forth with name-calling, with Mamdani even being questioned about if he still believes that Trump is a “fascist.”\n\nWatch the clip below.\n\n“Donald Trump went from calling the man a communist lunatic to glad-handing him publicly like one of Donald Trump’s beloved dictators,” O’Donnell carried on. “What we saw on Friday was Donald Trump offering an unconditional surrender. Donald Trump has not completed his first year in the second term of his presidency and he knows he is losing so badly now that he desperately has to do something and he has no idea what to do.”\n\nO’Donnell argued that Trump’s chat with Mamdani was held in an effort to clear up any mess he might’ve made, especially with his recent “punishable by death” remarks towards Democrats.\n\n“After calling for the death penalty for members of Congress who simply publicly stated military law, saying that members of the military must not follow illegal orders, even Donald Trump could figure out how insane that comment was,” O’Donnell said. “And so, Donald Trump desperately needed to do something to change the tone. And the next person in the door was the person he called a communist lunatic.”\n\nO’Donnell went on to say that despite Trump claiming that it would be a “total economic and social disaster” if Mamdani won his election, he welcomed Mamdani into the Oval Office because he, himself is losing his presidential throne.\n\n“And because Donald Trump cannot put his positions in the English language, he thought that the symbol of the new young mayor-elect and Donald Trump getting along, the symbol of Donald Trump getting along with the affordability guy would work for Donald Trump. It was pure pathetic losing political calculation by a loser.”",

        "text": "New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani announced a new economic and workforce development transition team that will be headed by, among others, reparations activist Darrick Hamilton, who argues the U.S. economy and governmental policies related to it are racist. Hamilton, who went to Oberlin College and later the University of Carolina at Chapel Hill, is the founding director of the Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy at the progressive The New School university in New York City. Hamilton's academic biography at The New School calls him a \"pioneer\" in the field of \"stratification economics,\" which is aimed at looking at how race and ethnicity are embedded into \"inequality\" in education, economic and health outcomes. Mamdani announced Monday the creation of more than 17 transition advisory committees made up of more than 400 people to help advise his incoming administration, including the Committee on Economic Development & Workforce Development, which Hamilton will help lead. MAMDANI'S TOP INCOMING AIDE WAS ‘CHIEF ARCHITECT’ OF RADICAL PROPOSAL OVERHAULING NYPD \"Since our nation’s inception, the immoral devaluation of Black lives has been ingrained in America’s political economy, and (has) manifested in a persistent, unjust, and enormous racial wealth gap,\" Hamilton told Congress in 2021. \"Our unjust racial wealth gap is itself an implicit measure of our racist past that is rooted in a history in which whites have been privileged by (a) government complicit (in) political and economic intervention(s) that have afforded them access to resources and iterative and intergenerational accumulation.\" Hamilton also sits on the New York State Community Commission on Reparations Remedies, where he advises members of the New York State legislature on policy recommendations for \"reparative justice,\" as it relates to \"the historical and present-day consequences of slavery and discrimination.\" One proposal Hamilton is known for is socioeconomic-based \"Baby Bonds,\" which would essentially establish racially conscious trust funds for children. The Baby Bonds would be given a certain amount of seed funding depending upon determined need, and would grow until the kids become adults and can use the money. Hamilton has argued that one-time reparations payments do not go far enough and steps, such as the Baby Bonds proposal, should be taken to help Black folks garner ownership of \"means of production in American society.\" Meanwhile, Hamilton has been criticized for allegedly wanting to add Black immigrants to reparations policies, as opposed to making them exclusively for the descendants of slavery. Yvette Carnell, a prominent activist and co-founder of the American Descendants of Slavery (ADOS) movement, has also called Hamilton \"clueless\" and accused the scholar of kowtowing to whichever politician is in power. \"The racial wealth gap is such that the typical Black family has about 10 cents on the dollar as a typical white family,\" Hamilton said during a 2020 podcast episode on Freakonomics Radio. \"That history of racial disparity, as it relates to wealth-building, certainly didn’t end with slavery,\" Hamilton added. \"There was the Homestead Act. There was the G.I. Bill. There was a system of sharecropping. There’s a system of Jim Crow. There is a system of redlining. It was government-facilitated.\" UNEARTHED ANTISEMITIC, ANTI-ISRAEL POSTS FROM MAMDANI AIDE SPARK GOP OUTRAGE During a separate appearance on The Black News Channel, Hamilton also said he is not one to \"compromise\" on policy either, when asked why Democrats are always \"compromising with crazy people.\" \"I don't like the word compromise … because one thing we know is that when we think about race, the group that is typically the first to be compromised are the issues related to those that are most marginalized, which in the United States' context has been Black people,\" Hamilton said during the 2021 Black News Chanel interview. \"We need government to start doing good,\" Hamilton continued, \"because when people realize the government can do good it creates a momentum, a movement forward that makes it harder for us to turn back.\" Other folks tapped for Mamdani's new Committee on Economic Development and Workforce Development include Gustavo Gordillo, co-chair of the New York City chapter of Democratic Socialists of America, and Deyanira Del Río, executive director of the New Economy Project, which she has said on the record is \"dedicated to building an economy … rooted in racial and gender justice, neighborhood equity and ecological sustainability.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Not long after Mamdani won his election and began nominating members to his transition team, he faced backlash for staffing his team with aides from former NYC mayoral campaigns, ranging from Bill de Blasio, to Michael Bloomberg to Eric Adams. Mamdani also tapped a longtime Biden adviser to help lead his transition that garnered criticism. \"The polls have barely closed, and already the incoming mayor is breaking one of his core promises to shake up the status quo and usher in a new day. New York City started a downward spiral under the de Blasio administration, and now some of its main players are returning to the halls of power,\" Republican strategist Colin Reed told Fox News Digital. \"And former FTC Chair Lina Khan became synonymous with her hostility toward businesses large and small during the Biden administration and one of the ringleaders of Bidenomics.\" Neither Mamdani's team, nor Hamilton, responded to Fox News Digital's requests for comments in time for publication.",

        "text": "Zohran Mamdani, and other top New York City officials could see their salaries jump under a proposed 16% pay hike that council members are hoping to push through soon, according to reports. A bill introduced by Councilwoman Nantasha Williams (D-Queens) would raise members’ salaries from $148,500 to $172,500, the New York Post reported Tuesday. If passed, the pay hike would also apply to the new mayor, public advocate, comptroller, and borough presidents. It would put Mamdani’s pay at nearly $300,000, up from the current $258,000, the outlet said. NYC MAYOR-ELECT MAMDANI ASKS SUPPORTERS FOR $4M TO FUND TRANSITION, VOWS NO WEALTHY DONORS Other top officials, such as the comptroller, public advocate, and borough presidents, would see comparable increases. The legislation would be introduced this week with a hearing by year’s end, allowing the next City Council to vote in January for a swifter approval. The last raise for Council members occurred in 2016. Interestingly, it was Mamdani who built out a platform centered on affordability for working-class New Yorkers. FOX NEWS' MARTHA MACCALLUM TO INTERVIEW NEW YORK MAYORAL CANDIDATE ZOHRAN MAMDANI The Ugandan-born 34-year-old pledged free buses, rent freezes on rent-stabilized apartments, universal childcare, and city-run grocery stores during his campaign for New York City mayor. He also campaigned on a gradual increase of the minimum wage to $30 an hour by 2030. Mamdani has said these proposals would be funded primarily by raising taxes on wealthy individuals and large corporations. As a state assembly member in 2022, Mamdani also voted for a pay raise for state legislators. MAMDANI LAUGHS OFF CRITICISM THAT HIS TAX HIKE PROPOSALS WILL COMPEL NEW YORKERS TO FLEE The latest NYC pay hike plans were originally set to go to Mayor Eric Adams’ desk, but that schedule was shelved, according to the Post. \"If we have a hearing on the bill this year, we don’t need a hearing on it next year. It’s pre-considered,\" Williams told The Post. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP When the outlet asked her if the council would pass the pay hike bill in January, Williams responded, \"That’s the goal.\" A source also said that the pay hike legislation puts Mamdani in a predicament: he could veto the bill or approve a law \"making New York more affordable for the political class,\" they said.

        "text": "A clique of Democratic senators who have dubbed themselves the “Fight Club” is demanding Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and the party’s official campaign organization take a hands-off approach to next year’s midterm elections.\n\nThe group of rabble-rousers is accusing Schumer (D-NY) and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) Chair Kristen Gillibrand (D-NY) of meddling in favor of so-called “establishment” candidates and wants them to be neutral. \n\nBut a source who was involved with arranging an early “Fight Club” meeting claims that the clique has quickly devolved into a “one big, giant mess” of pols angling to get credit with the Democratic base. \n\n“[Sen.] Tina [Smith] first conceived the idea to engage the New York Times and then the club turned sort of dysfunctional,” the source told The Post. “The biggest fight in the club is among the comms teams. No staffer trusts each other, and they’re looking for ways to get their boss maximum credit with the left.”\n\n“It’s one big, giant mess. Senator [John] Thune has something to be thankful for this Thanksgiving because more leaks are coming. It’s way beyond Chuck Schumer at this point. It’s dysfunction.”\n\nThe group — whose members include Sens. Smith (D-Minn.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — are particularly concerned about perceived DSCC meddling in heated primary contests in Maine, Michigan and Minnesota, according to the New York Times\n\n“We have a lot of good candidates out there, and the DSCC has seemed to put their foot on the scale in favor of the more establishment candidates as opposed to some of these, you know, other candidates,” Van Hollen told “CNN News Central” Tuesday.\n\n“It’s fine to support a Sherrod Brown [of Ohio] who was recruited into a race, but there are many active and open Senate Democratic primaries,” he added. “It’s our view that for the most part these should play out without interference from the Senate Democratic leadership.”\n\nThe existence of the “fight club” is the latest sign of rank-and-file discontent with Schumer, who has led the Senate Democratic caucus since 2017.\n\nA spokesperson for Schumer downplayed concerns about infighting and stressed that the minority leader’s priority is ensuring Democrats can flip the Senate in 2026.\n\n“Our North Star has always been winning the Senate majority in 2026 and any decision is made towards achieving that goal,” a Schumer spokesperson told The Post. “Sen. Schumer is focused more on winning than ideology when deciding who to support.”\n\nWhile the DSCC hasn’t officially made endorsements in any of the three contentious Senate primaries, the group is speculated to favor Maine Gov. Janet Mills, Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Mich.), and Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.)\n\n“I think it needs a rebrand, because it’s more like ‘Never Won a Real Fight Club,’ because these are a bunch of people who have never been engaged or never themselves been in a really competitive race,” a Democratic strategist who’s been involved with Senate campaigns vented to The Post.\n\nThis source noted that some of the “Fight Club” members benefited from interventions by prior Democratic leaders when they were campaigning for the Senate.\n\n“All of these things are hypocrisy at a minimum, but they are also campaign malpractice,” the source added, arguing it undercuts the push to get “the best candidate.”\n\nLast week, six senators — including three members of the “fight club” — cut a video endorsing Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan in her bid to replace the retiring Smith, though the incumbent was not among them.\n\n“We think she’s the sort of anti-business-as-usual candidate,” explained Van Hollen, who did appear in the endorsement video.\n\nSchumer, 75, has grappled with pressure from his caucus to be more combative against Republicans and the Trump administration.\n\nBack in March, he faced a revolt after declining to block a GOP effort to prevent a government shutdown. After seven Democrats and one Dem-aligned independent caved earlier this month and allowed the record-breaking 43-day government shutdown to end, Schumer faced blowback again from his left flank.\n\nNo sitting Democratic senator has called for new elections for Senate leader, but others — including House Democrats like Rep. Ro Khanna of California and insurgent Maine Senate candidate Graham Platner have called for new leadership.\n\nPublicly, Van Hollen has been among the Democratic senators most willing to publicly cross party leadership.\n\nIn September, he lashed out at Democratic leaders for dragging their feet on endorsing now-NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.\n\n“The DSCC is focused on winning Senate seats and flipping the majority in 2026, and our strategy is guided by the best way to do that,” DSCC spokesperson Maeve Coyle told the New York Times.\n\nSmith’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

        "text": "Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said she isn’t “interested in a bromance with the federal regime” days after New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s chummy visit with President Trump.\n\nThe progressive Democrat — whose policies Mamdani has praised — told local news outlets Monday she wasn’t looking to replicate Mamdani and President Trump surprisingly buddy-buddy tone in a White House meeting Friday.\n\n“From my point of view, flattery is not the way,” Wu said at a Thanksgiving drive when asked if she’d accept a similar invitation, according to the Boston Herald.\n\n“Boston residents want us to stand strong on our values and to get things done and to keep moving forward, and that’s what we’re going to continue to do.”\n\nWu, whose national profile has grown since she took office in 2021, has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration and slammed his crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\nMamdani, who shares similar policy positions with Wu, slammed Trump as a “fascist” during his mayoral campaign, but the pair were complimentary and cordial during the mayor-elect’s visit to the Oval Office.\n\nThe Queens democratic socialist, 34, carefully avoided praising Trump, but stressed the two talked about how they can both help New Yorkers. \n\nWhen reporters asked Mamdani about previous insults the state lawmaker leveled against Trump, the president even ran interference for him.\n\nWu, 40, said she would only meet with Trump if the federal government met various conditions.\n\n“If it came with a promise to stop snatching residents illegally off the streets, stop prosecuting his political enemies, stop cutting life saving research and funding?” she said, per the Boston Globe.\n\n“Sure, I would be open to a conversation at that point.”\n\nBut she also made clear every city and its leaders have a different calculus when dealing with the White House.\n\n“Every community has their unique and individual contexts, and every city leader, every university, every law firm, has to make their own decisions about how they handle this moment,” Wu said, according to reports.\n\n“On my part, I am fighting as hard as I possibly can to stop the actions of a federal government that seems intent on attacking its own people.”\n\nWhen reached for comment about Wu’s remarks, Mamdani’s transition campaign referred The Post to comments the incoming Hizzoner made on “Meet the Press.”\n\n“I think working for the people of New York City demands that you work with everyone and anyone, and that you always look to find those areas of agreement while not overlooking the places of disagreement,” he said on the Sunday morning show.",

        "text": "MS NOW’s Lawrence O’Donnell used his monologue on Monday’s “The Last Word” to show viewers the photo he said perfectly captures Donald Trump’s rapidly diminishing strength.\n\n“There is no more vivid image of the decline and fall of Donald Trump than the image that was created on Friday with Donald Trump slumped in the Oval Office at the desk in defeat, offering a political surrender to the man who stood beside him,” O’Donnell said, referencing Trump’s meeting with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.\n\nNew York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and Donald Trump meet in the Oval Office on Nov. 21.\n\nBefore Friday’s Oval Office meeting, many expected the democratic socialist and the Republican president to clash. However, following a private conversation, the president heaped praise on the incoming mayor, telling reporters he was “very confident” that Mamdani would do a “very good job.”\n\nAs O’Donnell pointed out, before the mayoral election, Trump had threatened to withhold federal funds from New York City if Mamdani was elected. But on Friday, Trump backtracked on that threat.\n\nThe MS NOW host called Trump’s flip-flop “a complete surrender” and described it as “the kind of reversal a politician offers only in defeat.”\n\nO’Donnell said the reason behind Mamdani’s warm reception at the White House wasn’t because Trump was “charmed by his smile,” arguing it was instead a political calculation by the president.\n\n“Donald Trump is losing, and Donald Trump knows it,” he said. O’Donnell suggested Trump was using Mamdani as a “political sign” to show the American people that he understands the issue that was at the center of the mayor-elect’s campaign: affordability. \n\nHowever, according to O’Donnell, the president’s play did not pay off. “It was pure, pathetic, losing political calculation by a loser — by a president who presided over a party that just had its worst Election Day imaginable.”\n\nO’Donnell said the optics of Trump’s Oval Office display showed his supporters that he is losing his political “superpowers” — and not only that, but “losing in a confrontation with a 34-year-old politician running in his first important election.”\n\n“The young man beat the old man, and the old man formally surrendered to the young man — and did it on TV,” O’Donnell said. “That image captures the decline and fall of Donald Trump as no other image has yet captured.”\n\nYou can watch O’Donnell’s full analysis in the clip at the top of the page.",

Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who oversees the party’s Senate campaign arm and has shaped its roster of preferred candidates.\n\nTheir uprising reflects something deeper than personal irritation. It mirrors a long-simmering frustration among Democratic voters who believe that party leaders have failed to project a clear, ambitious vision or to demonstrate a real appetite for political combat. \n\nAs the Times reports, these senators are fed up with the way Schumer and Gillibrand have selected and boosted establishment-aligned contenders whom they see as uninspired at best and self-sabotaging at worst.\n\nThe cracks have shown back home in New York, where neither Schumer nor Gillibrand endorsed Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist. But Mamdani didn’t just win; he routed former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, a result that has only sharpened questions about what, exactly, the party’s leaders are afraid of.\n\nThis early-stage rebellion is remarkable in itself. Schumer has long faced grumbling from within his caucus, but the emergence of an organized faction willing to openly challenge him signals something more serious—a belief that sticking with the status quo could cost Democrats the majority.\n\nThe “Fight Club” senators insist that their quarrel isn’t about ideology so much as posture. Party leaders, the senators argue, are still working from a playbook written for a different era. In their view, that approach is bleeding energy from a base that wants candidates who will stand up to the Trump administration and stop tiptoeing around the party’s more cautious instincts.\n\nBesides Sanders and Warren, the group reportedly includes Sens. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Tina Smith of Minnesota, and Chris Murphy of Connecticut. Others—Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico—have also joined conversations. \n\nTheir attention is now trained on several open Senate primaries in Minnesota, Michigan, and Maine. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee hasn’t issued formal endorsements, but the group worries that its silence amounts to a tacit blessing for more moderate picks, like Maine’s Janet Mills.\n\nSchumer’s office flatly rejects the idea of a brewing schism. \n\n“Our North Star is winning the Senate majority in 2026, and any decision is made to achieve that goal,” spokesperson Alex Nguyen told the Times.\n\nEven so, the Times notes that the “Fight Club” may endorse candidates who differ from those favored by the official campaign arm—a sign that the caucus’s center of gravity is shifting.\n\nIts first joint action came quickly, with a video endorsing Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan in her primary against Rep. Angie Craig.\n\nFor now, though, the group’s plans remain fluid. It’s been workshopping ideas in person and on an active text chain: joint fundraising, shared donor lists, coordinated endorsements, and campaign appearances. \n\nNothing is locked in, but the intent is clear: They want to build leverage.\n\nThe discontent, of course, extends far beyond this faction. Schumer’s numbers have been weak for months. Polling routinely shows him underwater in his home state, and a recent Siena survey put his favorability at its lowest level in decades, with just 32% of New Yorkers offering a positive view.\n\nStill, the “Fight Club” isn’t preparing a direct assault on incumbents, nor does it plan to intervene in Ohio or North Carolina, where Schumer recruited former Sen. Sherrod Brown and former Gov. Roy Cooper. \n\nTheir argument is more straightforward: The DSCC should stay out of primaries altogether and let voters choose candidates without a thumb on the scale. Speaking as a bloc, they hope, makes that case harder for leadership to ignore.\n\nRelated | Can progressives ride Mamdani’s momentum into the midterms?\n\nNot that they agree on everything.\n\nIn Michigan—home to one of the cycle’s highest-stakes Democratic primaries—Sanders and Heinrich landed on different endorsed candidates. But the broader point stands: They believe that Schumer’s approach to elections is uninspired and increasingly out of step with their voters.\n\nAnd the catalyst for this rebellion traces back to Schumer’s decision not to endorse Mamdani.\n\nNow a cluster of progressive senators is putting muscle behind the frustration that’s been simmering on the left for months. Whether their push forces Schumer to bend—or triggers a much bigger fight—remains the open question hanging over the party’s next chapter.",

I had no idea, and I was just flippin’, flippin’ through that.\"\n\n“Oh yeah, he’s bringing it there, right? Are you gonna go?” Friedland responded, referring to the White House UFC event planned for June 2026.\n\nThe mayor-elect replied with a firm “No.”\n\nMamdani, a Democratic socialist, made waves with his meeting with Trump on Friday. The Muslim mayor-elect stood by his previous comments calling the president a “fascist” and a “despot”—refusing to back down when pressed by reporters on his statements.\n\nThe president even came to his aid, surprising everyone when he told Mamdani not to answer a question about calling Trump a fascist. “That’s OK, you can just say yes,” Trump said. “It’s easier than explaining it. I don’t mind.”\n\nFriedland remarked on this exchange, asking Mamdani how he kept a straight face during the press conference. \n\n“We were all dying, and I’m like, my boy Zohran was like, straight face. [Trump] said, ‘Just tell them yes,” Friedland said. “How’d you keep that face?”\n\nMamdani smiled, telling Friedland, “Honestly, I was just thinking about New York City.”\n\nThe president had previously called Mamdani a “communist lunatic” and “not very smart.” But Trump called Friday’s meeting “very good” and “productive,” highlighting that the two had a lot more in common than they thought.\n\nTrump, 79, said he would “absolutely” feel comfortable living in New York City under Mamdani, and even rebuked MAGA faithful New York governor hopeful Elise Stefanik, who called Mamdani a “jihadist.”\n\nWhen asked if he agreed with Stefanik’s assessment of Mamdani, he replied, “No, I don’t. She’s out there campaigning. You say things sometimes on a campaign.”\n\nMamdani’s effort to meet with the president proved a success when Trump backed down from sending federal troops into the city—a significant reversal of his previous stance to “clean up the crime” and “save New York City.”",

        "text": "At least three times a week — and sometimes more — a big story will come out of New York about an awful crime that was committed against an innocent by a criminal who, too often, shouldn't have been walking the streets anyway due to a rap sheet as long as a CVS receipt. \n\nEven just scrolling down the front page of RedState, you can see this story published on Monday that reported that someone stabbed someone else on the New York subway because a person asked them not to talk on their cell phone so loudly. \n\nRead: Meanwhile, NYC Subway Rider Stabbed After Asking Attacker to Stop Talking Loudly on Cellphone\n\nCharming city. \n\nAnd it's about to get even better, because incoming New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani just added a man named Alex Vitale to his transition team. \n\nWho is Alex Vitale? He's the guy who says that if you \"don't want racism and violence, don't get the police involved.\" \n\nAlex Vitale — author of The End of Policing, sociology professor at Brooklyn College, CUNY Graduate Center, and now officially part of Zohran Mamdani’s transition team on “community safety” — gave this talk eleven days before George Floyd, when “defund” hadn’t even gone mainstream. He was already a true believer.\n\nHe also said that \"police are a direct interference\" with \"radical socialist oriented politics\" that will be \"used to stop us.\" \n\nProfessor Alex Vitale, now on Mamdani’s transition team, says the quiet part out loud, admitting that abolishing the police “creates political space for us to do what we need to do.”\n\nRecently, Mamdani said during his debate with Andrew Cuomo that he has no intention to defund the police, but it's kind of hard to take that kind of talk seriously when he's putting someone on his transition team who is openly hostile to the mere concept of policing. \n\nIf you need more proof that he wasn't just rattling off anti-police rhetoric to his socialist friends, keep in mind that Vitale is the author of the book \"The End of Policing,\" in which he advocates for dramatically reducing the budgets and duties of police departments and putting that money into more socialistic ventures like social workers. \n\nI think it's safe to say that Mamdani wasn't at all serious about not wanting to defund the police. He just brought in one of the biggest \"defund the police\" guys there is. \n\nThis is going to spell doom for the NYPD, and that's before Mamdani and Vitale can actually get their hands on it. As I reported in June, officers of the NYPD were already preparing for a mass exodus if Mamdani won: \n\n“The city would be totally unsafe for people who live here,” predicted Scott Munro, president of the NYPD Detectives’ Endowment Association.“I go to bed and worry about the phone ringing. I’m worried about my members getting killed. I don’t want to plan any funerals,” he added.“If you put a guy like him in there, our people are going to get hurt, and nobody’s going to want the job. It’s going to put recruitment back five more steps,” Munro said.NYPD brass are quietly bracing for a potential mass exodus unless Mayor Adams, a Democrat and retired NYPD captain seeking re-election as an independent, or GOP mayoral nominee Curtis Sliwa, pull off an upset. [As we know, that did not happen.]“I’ve had guys call me and say ‘If he wins, I’m quitting,’” a police source said of Mamdani. “It’s just weird that New York City would vote for him. I know he’s not here for the police.”\n\nRead: New York Is Going to Have Some Major Crime Problems If Mamdani Wins the Mayor's Race\n\nMunro is correct. The NYPD was already bleeding officers before Mamdani won the election, but I'm not entirely sure how the NYPD will stay near battle-ready now. Officers will likely cut and run to other departments outside the city, or possibly even move to different states, and rightly so. It's highly unlikely that Mamdani's regime will have officers' backs, and no one wants to be the next Derek Chauvin. \n\nNew Yorkers better brace for impact. Or better yet, leave. \n\nEditor’s Note: Zohran Mamdani is an avowed Democratic Socialist and has a real chance to become the next mayor of New York City.\n\nHelp us continue to report on his radical communist views and expose the Democrats who support him.

        "text": "THE DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has appointed a university professor who has described police officers as “violence workers” to serve on his community safety committee.\n\nMamdani announced Monday that Alex Vitale, a sociology professor at Brooklyn College, will advise his incoming administration on community safety matters. Vitale has a long history of disparaging police, calling them the “natural enemy” of the working class, and advocating for defunding law enforcement.\n\nThe appointment casts fresh doubt on the mayor-elect‘s attempt to distance himself from his own past remarks calling for the defunding of the New York Police Department (NYPD), which he labeled a “racist, anti-queer and a major threat to public safety.” \n\nVitale referred to individual officers as “class enemies” during a 2020 interview with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) when asked where police fit into the “class struggle.”\n\nHis 2017 book, “The End of Policing,” argues that the “problem is not police training, police diversity, or police methods. The problem is policing itself.”\n\n“The whole point is they’re violence workers. You can’t train them not to be violence workers,” Vitale said during a separate 2020 interview in which he argued that police cannot be reformed.\n\nLike Mamdani, Vitale has stated that the “institution of policing exists historically to facilitate racial inequality… emerging out of colonialism, slavery, and industrial capitalism.”\n\nThe professor also advocates decriminalizing so-called “sex work” or prostitution and produced a 2025 film titled “Sex Work: It’s Just a Job.”\n\nVitale is one of roughly 400 advisors who will serve across 17 committees ahead of Mamdani’s January inauguration.\n\n“A love for hard work, a deep belief in the promise of New York City, and a commitment to the affordability agenda that New Yorkers are demanding unite the more than 400 experts we have appointed to our Transition Committees today,” Mamdani said on Monday. \n\n“By helping us recruit top talent and develop smart policy, these committees will be instrumental to ensuring we hit the ground running on Jan. 1—and that our results align with the promises we’ve made.”\n\nMamdani has insisted in recent months that he no longer supports defunding the NYPD. He also apologized to officers during an October Fox News interview for past disparaging comments, saying he is committed to “representing the men and women of the NYPD.”\n\n“I apologize because of the fact that I’m looking to work with these officers, and I know that these officers, these men and women who serve in the NYPD, they put their lives on the line every single day,” Mamdani said.\n\nVitale’s views, however, are consistent with positions held by the DSA, of which Mamdani is a member. The group calls on the country to “end the criminalization of working-class survival,” “invest in community self-governance and care, not cops” and provide “freedom for all incarcerated people.”\n\n“For all of the working class to achieve collective liberation, we must constrain, diminish, and abolish the carceral forces of the state — from prisons and police themselves, to their manifestations in all forms throughout society,” the DSA’s website says.\n\nAs recently as December 2024, Mamdani called for cuts to funding for the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group, the unit that responded to the killing of Officer Didarul Islam.\n\nMeanwhile, NYPD data shows that misdemeanors, “major” felonies and non-major felonies in New York City have been more frequent every year since 2020.\n\nNeither Mamdani nor Vitale responded to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\nOriginally published by The Daily Caller News Foundation.",

        "text": "A pack of Democratic senators and Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are forming a coalition against Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his midterm strategy.\n\nThe group, dubbed the “Fight Club,” includes Sanders and Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Tina Smith of Minnesota, according to the New York Times (NYT). In addition to Schumer, the coalition’s ire is also aimed at the Senate Democratic Leader’s Empire State colleague, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who heads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), Senate Democrats’ campaign arm. (RELATED: Ditching Chuck Schumer Seems To Be Common Thread Among Many Democrats Running For Senate)\n\nThe Fight Club, whose existence was first reported by the NYT, seeks to directly challenge the way Schumer and Gillibrand have chosen and recruited Democratic Senate candidates, and argues their picks are more aligned with the party establishment. Schumer angered the party’s left-wing base after repeatedly declining to endorse New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, an avowed socialist aligned with the Sanders and Democrats’ left-flank, including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe group is discussing joint-fundraising efforts, lending their donor lists to candidates, offering endorsements and making appearances on the campaign trail, according to the NYT. They aim to focus on primaries for open seats in Maine, Michigan and Minnesota, where they believe leadership is pushing for Gov. Janet Mills, Rep. Haley Stevens and Rep. Angie Craig, respectively.\n\nTrump narrowly won Michigan in the 2024 presidential election, but he lost Maine and Minnesota.\n\nThe Fight Club, apart from Smith, publicly endorsed Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan for the Senate seat from which Smith is retiring. The Minnesota Senator has said she will not endorse a candidate in the primary race to succeed her.\n\nIn addition to Flanagan, Sanders prominently supports a pair of left-wing candidates, former public health official Abdul El-Sayed in Michigan and oyster farmer Graham Platner in Maine. Platner has notably joined other Democratic candidates in calling for Schumer’s ouster as Senate Democratic Leader.\n\nStevens also declined to answer whether she would vote for Schumer to lead the party if she was elected to the Senate.\n\nDemocratic Sens. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico have also joined in some of the Fight Club’s actions, according to the NYT. Markey is currently facing a competitive 2026 Democratic primary challenge from Democratic Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton.\n\nAlex Nguyen, a spokesperson for Schumer, told the NYT in a statement, “Our North Star is winning the Senate Majority in 2026 and any decision is made to achieve that goal.”\n\nSchumer’s approval ratings are their lowest in decades, according to a recent Siena Poll, and Democrats have repeatedly broken ranks to criticize the minority leader’s decisions.\n\nIn March, Schumer wrangled together enough Democrats to pass a stopgap funding bill and avert a government shutdown, infuriating his base who were hoping to make a stand against the Trump administration. Schumer again met the ire of his party when he failed to keep his caucus together, resulting in eight senators crossing the aisle to reopen the government after a 43-day shutdown — although Schumer himself still voted with the majority of his caucus to reject the shutdown-ending deal.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has sidestepped questions about the possibility of challenging Schumer in 2028 for years, but calls for her to mount a primary challenge to him have increased as public criticism of the Democratic leader mounts. Polls have also shown her with double-digit leads over the longtime senator.\n\nWhen she was asked in November if she would potentially run against Schumer in 2028, she punted the question, telling reporters, “That is years from now.”\n\nSens. Gillibrand, Warren, Sanders, Van Hollen, Murphy, Smith, Markey, Merkley and Heinrich all did not respond to requests for comment by the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

        "text": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nWhile President Donald Trump held a lovefest for New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in the Oval Office last week, the right flank of his party was promptly freaking out. “Wild to allow a jihadist communist to stand behind the president’s desk in the Oval Office,” Laura Loomer, conspiracy theorist and unofficial Trump adviser, lamented on X. She was not the only one lacing her criticism of Trump’s meeting with Mamdani with outright bigotry that targeted the mayor-elect’s Muslim faith. Prior to Trump’s meeting, Republicans had actually strategized around making Mamdani—and his Muslim background—a serious political target going forward.\n\nThe consequences of that targeting have been frightening. Islamophobia has skyrocketed ever since Mamdani’s primary upset in June, and experts are predicting that it will get even worse next year as his first term as mayor collides with a contentious midterm season.\n\nIslamophobia is an age-old theme in American politics, peaking some 20 years ago in the aftermath of 9/11 and ebbing and flowing in the years since. It was largely viewed as fringe and extreme, but those in positions of power were reasonably quick to condemn it. Even as he was launching a global war on terror that targeted Muslim countries and their civilian populations, Republican President George W. Bush still felt it important to proclaim “Islam is peace” in the days following the 9/11 attacks. America’s political landscape has dramatically shifted since that speech was delivered, and nowadays, as we face a hyperpolarized electorate, racist and bigoted rhetoric is becoming the norm.\n\nTo understand the depth of the problem, Equality Labs, a South Asian civil rights advocacy group, analyzed social media activity that specifically targeted Mamdani from his June primary win through October. The group’s final report detailed how there were over 17 million posts circulated across 12 different platforms that amplified disinformation and hate speech targeting Mamdani. Even more alarming, Equality Labs identified more than 45 Republican officials from across 18 states who amplified this rhetoric.\n\nThis tracks when you consider that about a month ago, the National Republican Congressional Committee sent out a midterms strategy memo outlining how the national GOP strategy will tie “every House Democrat” to Mamdani’s “anti-American agenda, and the NRCC will weaponize it against them.” Digital ads implementing this strategy have already hit the airwaves, while plenty of Republicans have hit the ground running. New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who recently announced she’s running for governor, called Mamdani a “jihadist” just last week. Trump, instead of condemning the comment, brushed it off during his meeting with Mamdani. “She’s out there campaigning. You say things sometimes in a campaign.” Trump would know, as he signed an executive order eight years ago explicitly banning immigrants from Muslim-majority countries and floated the idea of creating a national registry of Muslims, then turned around and courted Muslim American voters for his third bid for president.\n\nRep. Randy Fine announced he was actively working with the Trump administration “to fight this Muslim terrorist,” and went so far as to say, “Mamdani should be denaturalized and deported ASAP.” Republican Rep. Andy Biggs also suggested that Mamdani’s electoral win meant New York City would be transformed into an Islamic state. “We must stop the advancement of Sharia Law in its tracks. It has no place in our Republic.”\n\nThe reach of these messages is truly incomprehensible. Equality Labs estimated that terms like terrorist, jihadi, Islamist, and communist reached billions of people across news, social media, and other online platforms. “The volume, coordination, and repetition signal a deliberate strategy to nationalize a local race by weaponizing bigotry as a turnout engine,” the group’s report says.\n\nA different study from Stop AAPI Hate, a group that tracks hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, found similar results. Analyzing some 1,500 slurs targeted at Mamdani from October through November, the group found 91 percent of them disparaged his Muslim faith. “Overall, Islamophobic slurs targeting Mamdani saw an increase of 175 percent,” says the group.\n\nAs the midterms approach, we can look to the recent Nov. 4 elections to get a taste of what’s to come when Mamdani is not on the ballot. In Virginia, when Ghazala Hashmi was running to become lieutenant governor—she won her race and is now the first Muslim woman in the entire country to be elected to statewide office—her opponent, Republican John Reid, publicly described her as a “pro Hamas radical leftist” and suggested Mamdani was her “NYC twin.” And some 1,200 miles away in Minnesota, state Sen. Omar Fateh’s campaign said he was receiving a “steady stream of hate, racial and Islamophobic slurs,” as he waged a campaign for mayor of Minneapolis. The attacks culminated in his campaign office being vandalized with an Islamophobic message: “Somali Muslim—This warning is no joke.” Fateh ultimately finished in second place behind Democratic incumbent Mayor Jacob Frey, who did publicly condemn Islamophobia and the hate Fateh received.\n\nThe evidence is clear: The normalization of Islamophobia risks not only Mamdani’s future mayoral administration but is a threat to every South Asian elected official and voter across the country. What is unclear is what the Republican Party will do now thatTrump has seemingly had a change of heart around Mamdani. The response to the meeting has not been heartening, as it seems to reveal plenty of Republicans are happy to continue pandering racist and bigoted language if it means gaining political ground at the expense of the entire electorate, and especially South Asian Americans.",

        "text": "It’s been over ten years since Donald Trump came down that escalator and said the thing that we’re not supposed to say – that illegal immigration is not an act of love, except in the most appalling figurative sense, that too many illegal aliens are criminals in other ways beyond just being illegal aliens, and that they should all go home – yet, apparently, the smart people have failed to pay any attention to him since. Again and again, he does things and triumphs, leaving them baffled. They really don’t understand Donald Trump, not in the least. It’s remarkable. This guy is entirely transparent. He does the same thing again and again and again. Yet, when he does the same thing again and again and again, the smart set – which includes Democrats, regime media folks (to the extent that is different), and even some alleged conservatives – is stunned, staggered, and baffled and draws all the wrong conclusions. Which is fine with me. I like it when my opponents get my side wrong.\n\nWhat am I talking about in this particular case? This happens all the time, and there were a lot of cases of our betters not understanding Trump. Well, a few days ago, the President – I love hearing him called that as much as his opponents hate it – met with Zohran Mamdani, the communist mayor-elect of New York City, at the White House. The big shocker for people who aren’t paying attention and shouldn’t have been surprised was that Trump didn't act like a jerk to him. He played the gracious host. He was nice and polite, joking around, flattering, and generally not being aggressive or hostile to his guest. Well, Trump‘s critics were gravely disappointed. How could he not be aggressive and hostile to this guy? \n\nOf course, Donald Trump is aggressive and hostile to people at appropriate times. And here, I’m talking about the seditionist Democrat vets and ridiculous CIA clerks, who try to pretend they are the equal of vets, who are encouraging dumb 23-year-old barracks lawyers to ruin their lives with a term in Leavenworth and a bad conduct discharge to provide Democrats some performance art propaganda. The smart set is mad aboutTrump‘s very hostile reaction to that seditious blue falconry. But they’re also mad that Trump was nice to Mamdani. Mean is bad, but nice is also bad. It’s really weird that they’re mad about Trump, no matter what he does or how he does it. You might conclude that this is a game Trump can’t win, except Trump isn't playing their game. He’s the undisputed champion of the world at doing what Trump does.\n\nWe know why they’re objecting to Trump. It’s because they don’t like Trump. But what’s their explanation, because they have to fake an explanation? Some of the critics actually asserted that Donald Trump is somehow sympathetic to Zohran Mamdani’s lefty politics. They actually took Trump's courtesy and flattery as manifestations of his actual beliefs rather than as part of his playing this Instagram amateur. The idea that somehow the goofy commie foreigner that the dummies in the Big Apple elected to accelerate the ruin of their city is going to convert Donald Trump to the joys of Marxism is so stupid that it pains me to even address it. But that’s what they think. They think that Donald Trump’s going to go socialist, and their evidence is that he didn’t punch Ugandan Che in the pinko’s piehole. \n\nWhat the hell is wrong with these people? Do they not know anything about how Donald Trump works after all this time? Did they not internalize the things they have seen him do over the last decade? They have eyes but will not see. It’s remarkable. Is there anybody out there who actually believes that Donald Trump was doing anything but putting on a show with this guy? If they do, they’re dumb, and if they don’t, they think you’re dumb – this is the eternal question of American politics today.\n\nSo, what did Donald Trump win by not getting into a giant Scat Francisco sidewalk contest with the teen socialist heartthrob? He won by looking normal. Normal people out there don’t like politics. They don’t understand why pols have to hate each other in public. They like the idea that people on both sides of the aisle can shake hands and be friendly and polite. And Donald Trump gets it. Oh, he delivers the heat when he needs to. He knows how to own the libs. But he’s also a master of optics. He’s the king of public relations. And he has sensed that this is a moment to show unity, just like down the road, there’s going to be a moment to show Mamdani the Gucci loafer Trump‘s going to use to kick his butt.\n\nAgain, Trump is the undisputed champion of the world at this stuff, and he knew exactly what he was doing. He brought in a fresh, young, and popular Democrat ingenue, put him in a position as a supplicant – the guy looked like he was crawling to his elder for approval – and then acted measured, reasonable, and nice. Yeah, it was disappointing for a lot of the people who are disappointed in Trump, no matter what Trump does, but normal people probably took a look at this tableau and thought, “Good, it’s nice to see people talking about their differences rather than threatening to kill people.” Or, in the case of the Democrats’ perverted constituents, actually killing people.\n\nTrump did the same thing with Putin, and it hasn’t worked yet. He did the same thing with the Little Rocket Man, and we haven’t gone to war with North Korea. He did the same thing with MBS, which made everybody mad because apparently this Third World potentate allegedly acted like a Third World potentate to some Third World jihadi supporter and we’re supposed to care so much that we toss away a major ally. Oh, by the way, here’s a hint from a guy who had to persuade people as a job – the fact that someone was a WaPo journalist does not make me more sympathetic to him. Just saying.\n\nIn any case, Trump is nice to people whom the smart set says we’re not supposed to be nice to. Keep in mind, this is the same smart set with an unbroken track record of foreign policy and other failures over the last few decades. Trump, on the other hand, is ending wars left and right, winning fights when he is drawn into them, and has just happened to create Middle East peace, which no one else was able to do. Trump is racking up triumph after triumph. Is his record perfect? No. He hasn’t solved the Ukraine War yet, though it’s kind of odd that solving the Ukraine War is America’s problem, just like every problem around the world is apparently America’s problem. In this case, he’s done an amazing job, and his critics have, well, completely screwed up everything they put their soft little paws on.\n\nYou might think people would learn from how Trump succeeds while being consistently underestimated, because it happens over and over again. They decree that he’s a fool, an amateur, and a clown, and he comes back and triumphs where they failed. Right now, we have a bunch of people doom-mongering about the economy. They’re absolutely sure Trump’s going to lose the midterms. I’m not sure he’s going to lose the midterms. He certainly could. But that’s not set in stone. This is the guy who brings in wins that we never imagined possible. He brings in wins seemingly out of the blue when we were told he’s doomed. Holy cow, he just dispatched Marjorie Taylor Greene; where did that come from? We were told that her narcissistic chimp-out was going to tear us apart. We’re not torn apart, but she’s hitting the bricks. We’re told we’re going to lose the redistricting fight. The Texas abomination just got stayed, and I wouldn’t want to be a Penceophilic femboy Fredocon Indiana state senator right now. If you are one of those geniuses who is surprised that he’s turned defeat into victory, all I can suggest is that you pay closer attention to how this guy works. You’ve had a decade to learn how this guy works. Maybe you should try paying attention to him instead of whining about him all the time.\n\nLook, Donald Trump is a sui generis politician. There’s no one else like him, but he has patterns. He has habits. He has tactics, techniques, and procedures that he doesn’t bother to conceal. The guy’s totally transparent, yet he’s able to hide in plain sight. Why? To examine what he does is to take him seriously. To look at how he works is to concede that he’s not a fool, not a clown, not a hapless and feckless naif who somehow stumbles into victory after victory. They can’t treat him as somebody who’s an effective politician because that gives him credit and giving him credit is simply a bridge too far.\n\nTheir analysis is clouded by their hate, but that’s good. It gives him an advantage.

        "text": "New York made a huge mistake in electing Zohran Mamdani. But it seems the only way they'll learn is by suffering through the next four years of his socialist policies.\n\nThe biggest change will be in Mamdani's approach to crime. Frankly, New York doesn't have the best track record on that to begin with. Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg has a history of downgrading felonies to misdemeanors, maliciously prosecuting New Yorkers who defend themselves from the violent criminals who go through the revolving-door justice system.\n\nNow Mamdani's pick for his Criminal Legal Committe, Janos Marton, wants to make that situation even worse by freeing at least 80 percent of the city's prison and jail population.\n\nMamdani's CriminaI Legal Committee pick Janos Marton: \"Cut 80% of our prison, jail population\" pic.twitter.com/mRJ9IWwvyq— End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) November 25, 2025\n\nAccording to the video caption, Marton was also a candidate for Manhattan District Attorney and this was part of his campaign pitch to New Yorkers.\n\n\"How do we get this country to a place where we have one million fewer people in jail and prison?\" Marton said. \"Now, as it relates to Manhattan, I think we can be a little bit bolder than that. We are a supposedly liberal city with a ton of resources and a ton of ways to support people outside of jail and prison, and so I've called for cutting the Manhattan jail population by 80 percent.\"\n\nThis shows a fundamental misunderstanding of crimes and criminality. Criminals keep committing crimes because they face no consequences. Many of them are mentally ill, but some are just evil people who enjoy committing crimes. The only way to keep people safe is to put them in prison.\n\nEven if, in theory, providing them support and mental health resources in the community was a viable option, it doesn't work without strict enforcement. That is, policies have to be in place that mandate mentally ill people take medication, participate in therapy, and behave. Those policies have to be strictly enforced. \n\nInstead, the Left not only doesn't enforce criminal law, but it also refuses to enforce mandates on mental health services.\n\nOn top of that, Mamdani has also hired Alex Vitale, a radical anti-police abolitionist who wants to work on \"community safety.\"\n\nZohran \"I no longer want to abolish the NYPD\" Mamdani hires... *checks notes*... vocal police abolitionist Alex Vitale to work on \"community safety.\" https://t.co/l1kPxp9ilO— Rafael A. Mangual (@Rafa_Mangual) November 25, 2025\n\n\"I'm excited to announce that I have been asked to join the Mamdani Transition Team to work on community safety issues. A New Era for NYC.\"\n\nI'm excited to announce that I have been asked to join the Mamdani Transition Team to work on community safety issues. A New Era for NYC. pic.twitter.com/JJBgJsvSpy— Alex Vitale (@avitale) November 24, 2025\n\nVitale is the author of 'The End of Policing,' a 2017 book in which Vitale advocates for reallocating funds from police to social services. Vitale argues that the \"function of police is to uphold inequalities of class, gender, race, or sexuality.\"\n\nAs we said above, the \"social services\" approach to crime doesn't work because the Left has no interest in mandating the use of medications, therapy, and group-home living situations that might address some of the issues driving crime (e.g. mental illness). It's a ruse for their ultmate goal: the destruction of America.\n\nAnd there's no better way to do that than to let criminals run amok in our cities.\n\nEditor’s Note: Zohran Mamdani, an avowed Democratic Socialist, will be the next mayor of New York City.\n\nHelp us continue to report on his radical communist views and expose the Democrats who support him.

        "text": "The analysis, which leverages anonymized financial data from Chase customers, suggests that the period of relying on pandemic-era excess cash liquidity is now “in the rearview mirror,” and many consumers are facing a spending season where budgets are “tempered by tepid income growth.” For consumers who are “relatively disadvantaged by high housing costs and hold less stock market wealth”—a group that disproportionately includes younger and lower-income individuals—they may have “justenough to spend, but not enough to splurge” this year.\n\nThese findings come at the end of a year when voter anger over the cost of living unseated Democrats from the White House and installed President Donald Trump for a second, nonconsecutive term, only to see voters back Democrats across the board in off-year elections. Many of the benefactors, including New York City Mayor–elect Zohran Mamdani, stressed the “affordability” problem that many are facing, while Trump’s approval ratings on the economy have plummeted.\n\nGen Z has born the brunt of what Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell memorably called a “low-hire, low-fire” labor market, where it’s looking pretty frozen. “Kids coming out of college and younger people, minorities, are having a hard time finding jobs,” Powell told reporters in September. Several weeks later, Goldman Sachs economists warned that “jobless growth” might become a permanent feature of the economy. Many economists have embraced a term from the Biden years that aligns with what JPMorgan is finding: “the K-shaped economy,” with diverging paths for wealthier and lower-income Americans.\n\nTo be sure, while JPMorgan’s report does not touch on the political scene and the affordability politics of 2025, it paints a picture of a tenuously balanced economic environment, full of friction with low real income and insufficient wealth accumulation among key demographics.\n\nReal income stagnation mirrors recessionary period\n\nMedian real income growth has sustained a weak trend for several months, with the October 2025 reading for prime-age individuals (ages 25–54) settling at only 1.6% in real terms. This low sustained pace is near the range observed during the weak labor market of the early 2010s, a period when the unemployment rate averaged 7%. This was, as the institute says, “when the unemployment rate was still elevated from the Great Recession,” although the current unemployment rate sits notably lower than in that period, at 4.3%.\n\nWhile nominal income growth remains roughly consistent with pre-pandemic levels, the higher pace of consumer price increases means real purchasing power gains are low.\n\nThis general stagnation is proving particularly challenging across demographics. Young people “continue to underperform the typical early career growth pattern” as income growth for individuals ages 25–29 is currently below historical trends for younger workers. Younger workers typically rely on job switching to rapidly advance their careers. However, the current slowdown in hiring is hindering this typical rapid pace of income advancement.\n\nThe downturn in overall income growth is also impacting older demographics. Workers ages 50–54 are now experiencing negative real year-over-year income growth. And since older workers generally face slower annual gains, a combination of weakening in the labor market and an uptick in inflation can more easily send their purchasing power into negative territory. Negative real growth for older workers can lead to challenging adjustments, particularly for lower-wealth individuals who have not benefited from years of strong gains in housing and stock prices.\n\nFlat balances offer little cushion\n\nHouseholds’ median real cash balances have remained flat since early 2024, holding steady throughout most of 2025. This stability marks a deviation from pre-pandemic trends, where real balances typically grew steadily at an annual rate of just over 6% as households aged. If balances had grown at that historical rate since 2020, they would be up 40% in October relative to 2019; instead, they are only up 23%.\n\nThis flat growth indicates that households are not accumulating additional cash reserves in their checking and savings accounts. \n\nAlthough high-income households have continued to see slight declines in their bank balances (only 2% negative in October 2025), potentially owing to transfers to higher-yield accounts or investment brokerage accounts, low-income households returned to positive year-over-year bank balance growth in September 2024. Despite these shifts in savings strategy, the approximation of total cash reserves—including investment transfers—shows that growth has been positive for all income groups for at least the past year.\n\nGoing into the end of the year, consumers with constrained budgets may look to stock market gains to augment spending. However, the report cautions that these stock market gains are “highly unequally distributed,” leaving younger and lower-income groups with less of a financial cushion as they navigate stagnant real purchasing power.\n\nFor this story, Fortune used generative AI to help with an initial draft.

Andrew Cuomo in the Nov. 4 mayoral election.\n\nThe controversial mayor-elect has raised fears in the five boroughs over his democratic socialist agenda and has worried many in the Jewish community over his anti-Israel rhetoric.\n\nTucker will officially resign on Dec. 19, after serving just over a year in the post.\n\nHe is expected to return to the private security firm, T&M USA, a New York City-based company with connections to Israel which he headed before taking on the FDNY position.\n\nMamdani has often been critical of Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the Jewish state’s counteroffensive in Gaza following the sneak terror attack by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nTucker and the firm faced some controversy when Adams nominated him for the post, when it surfaced that one of T&M’s billionaire clients allegedly admitted to working with Chinese intelligence in the past.",

        "text": "Happy Tuesday, and welcome to another edition of Rent Free. This week's stories include:\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass' persistent cowardice on housing.\nThe Department of Justice's antitrust settlement with RealPage.\nThe ROAD to Housing Act's frosty receptions in the House.\n\nKaren Bass Says the Key to Defeating NIMBYism Is Allowing Less Housing \n\nMy colleague Matt Welch has recorded an interview with L.A. Mayor Karen Bass for his Fifth Column podcast, which is well worth a listen for lots of reasons. Most relevant for this newsletter is the discussion of housing construction and NIMBYism in Los Angeles.\n\nI'd direct readers to one point about 35 minutes into the conversation, where Welch pushes Bass on why she came out against allowing people in the Palisades area to build duplexes on lands ravaged by this year's fires.\n\nBass' response is telling.\n\n\"Because the people in the Palisades didn't want that,\" says Bass. \"When it comes to building is that…I think you need to build with communities…I think that if you impose it on a neighborhood, then you will have hardcore NIMBYs.\"\n\n\"You're saying you're doing this to prevent NIMBYism, but doesn't that on some level just entrench it?\" responds Welch.\n\nThe two have a number of similar back-and-forths throughout the conversation. Bass continues to stick to this general worldview that the way to keep NIMBYism in check is to give a lot of ground to their opposition to new housing.\n\nWelch continually raises the (reasonable, in my opinion) counterpoint that you don't defeat NIMBYism by giving in to it.\n\nDuring her tenure as mayor, Bass has long expressed the view that new housing (and particularly subsidized affordable housing) is good, so long as City Hall doesn't allow too much of it.\n\nShe stood up a program called ED1 to streamline new housing production, and then worked to roll it back once the development applications flooded in.\n\nShe opposed S.B. 79, a state bill allowing more apartments near transit stops, for the similar reason that the city was losing its ability to more minutely control where new units should go and how many of them should be allowed.\n\nToday I signed a City Council resolution opposing SB79 unless it is amended to exempt cities with a state-approved and compliant Housing Element. \nWhile I support the intent to accelerate housing development statewide, as written, this bill risks unintended consequences for LA.\n— Mayor Karen Bass (@MayorOfLA) August 20, 2025\n\nIt's true that if you allow fewer homes in fewer places, fewer NIMBYs will express fewer objections to projects that aren't happening. The obvious takeaway, as Welch says repeatedly, is that you're defeating anti-development attitudes by defeating development.\n\nThat might be a sensible, middle-of-the-road position to take for a mayor looking to reduce headaches generated by land-use battles. But it also means housing-starved Los Angeles will see a lot fewer homes built.\n\nSometimes conflict is a necessary part of change. A mayor who wants to see her city become affordable would lean into those conflicts instead of shrinking from them.\n\nThe ROAD to Housing Act Hits a Speed Bump \n\nA bipartisan housing bill that sailed through the Senate is now facing an uncertain future in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe ROAD to Housing Act—an amalgam of mostly small housing policy tweaks to federal grant programs and financial regulations aimed at increasing housing production—passed the Senate as part of this year's National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) back in October.\n\nAs Politico reports today, however, House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill (R–Ark.) is holding up consideration of the NDAA until the housing provisions are stripped from it. Hill has been saying for the last week that he supports the ROAD to Housing Act, but some Republicans object to particular provisions. Therefore, he wants it considered as a standalone proposal.\n\nPer Politico, deals offered by Sens. Tim Scott (R–S.C.) and Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.)—the Senate Banking Committee chair and ranking member who shepherded the bill through the Senate—to keep the ROAD to Housing Act in the NDAA have been rejected.\n\nHousing advocates who support the bill are already attempting to manage expectations should it not pass before Congress adjourns for its December recess.\n\n\"We're optimistic that Congress may still advance ROAD to Housing provisions this year, but even if it doesn't, bipartisan momentum for housing reform remains strong,\" said the Bipartisan Policy Center's Dennis Shea in an emailed statement last week. \"With the House planning a December hearing on roadblocks to housing supply and a subsequent mark-up, prospects for meaningful action in 2026 are encouraging.\"\n\nYou can read Rent Free's coverage of the specifics of the ROAD to Housing Act here.\n\nThe DOJ and RealPage Turn Over a New Leaf \n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) has reached a provisional settlement in a major antitrust lawsuit it brought against real estate software company RealPage that alleged the company's products enabled landlords to illegally collude on price increases.\n\nRealPage's software, using a mix of public and nonpublic data on leases, rents, and vacancy rates, would recommend profit-maximizing rent and vacancy levels to the company's landlord clients. Critics charged that this software effectively created a cartel among landlords, who were told by the company's algorithm to hold rents at above-market rates.\n\nThe legal case against RealPage's software rested on the fact that its algorithm relied on proprietary data from competing landlords to recommend marketwide rent levels.\n\n\"Competing companies must make independent pricing decisions, and with the rise of algorithmic and artificial intelligence tools, we will remain at the forefront of vigorous antitrust enforcement,\" said Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division.\n\nThe settlement agreement, which will still have to be accepted by the court, will limit RealPage's ability to use real-time leasing data to train its models. Its models would not be allowed to consider geographic effects narrower than the state level.\n\n\"RealPage's historical use of aggregated and anonymized nonpublic data, which include rents that are typically lower than advertised rents, has led to lower rents, less vacancies, and more procompetitive effects,\" said Stephen Weissman, a lawyer representing RealPage.\n\nWeissman said that RealPage has already been in the process of implementing changes required by the proposed settlement. As part of the agreement with the DOJ, the company does not concede any wrongdoing.\n\nIn recent years, RealPage has become the latest boogeyman blamed for high housing prices. Private litigants and state attorneys general accused the company in their own lawsuits of driving up vacancy rates and prices by encouraging landlords to hold units off the market.\n\nThe Biden administration first sued the company in August 2024.\n\nAs I've written before, whatever the legal merits of the DOJ case, the economic attack against RealPage never made much sense.\n\nThe limited research on rent-recommendation software has generally found that it leads to more efficient pricing. In down markets, it encourages landlords to cut prices faster. In hot markets, it encourages them to raise prices faster.\n\nWe can see evidence for this argument in rough comparisons between different cities' housing markets. Austin landlords' use of RealPage software hasn't stopped rents from plummeting in response to a glut of new supply. San Francisco's ban on the use of rent-recommendation software hasn't stopped rents in that supply-constrained city from rising.\n\nUpdate: pic.twitter.com/fx6kCW2iKY\n— Max Dubler ????️‍???? (@maxdubler) November 23, 2025\n\nWhile the federal case against RealPage is now over, the lawsuits brought by state attorneys general will continue.\n\nQuick Links \n\nA new investigation from The Washington Post finds that developers with political connections to D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser are earning outsize returns on a city-subsidized affordable housing development.\nSome helpful visual evidence of San Francisco's inability to build.\n\nWhen you wonder why housing is so expensive in San Francisco, the Bay Area, California, America pic.twitter.com/CzSX6Fc5wb\n— Jeremy Levine, PhD of city council meetings (@JeremyELevine) November 21, 2025\n\nNew York City Mayor–elect Zohran Mamdani mentions in a recent interview that he spoke with President Donald Trump about the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, or ULURP, the city's laborious process for approving zoning changes that enable new housing. One can imagine that the developer president and the socialist mayor both have reasons not to like that particular process.\nSpeaking of Mamdani, the mayor-elect has released the names of people on his housing transition team. The list notably includes a few YIMBYs. It notably excludes owners of rent-stabilized housing being forced into bankruptcy by the city's rent control policies.\n\nZohran Mamdani is in Central Park announcing hundreds of appointees to his transition committee. \nAmong those here: @annemariegray, head of YIMBY group @OpenNYForAll pic.twitter.com/qdwCYn2zAk\n— Nick Garber (@nick_garber) November 24, 2025\n\nThe New York Times' Ezra Klein highlights the decades-long falling rate of new housing construction per capita in his latest column.",

Recipients born between the 11th and 20th are paid on the third Wednesday, and those born after the 20th are paid on the fourth Wednesday.For those who received Social Security before May 1997, you can expect your payment on the third day of the month, unless it falls on a weekend or holiday.Those who receive both Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) can expect their Social Security payment on the third day of the month and their SSI payment on the first day of the month.Full 2025 Social Security payment calendarSSI payment schedule for the rest of 2025 and into 2026SSI checks will be sent out on the following dates in 2025 and early 2026, according to the SSA calendar:Monday, Dec. 1, 2025 (Check for December 2025)Wednesday, Dec. 31, 2025 (Check for January 2026)Friday, Jan. 30, 2026 (Check for February 2026)Friday, Feb. 27, 2026 (Check for March 2026)Fernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

Turkey tradition: The history of the presidential turkey pardonThe pardoning tradition officially began at the 1989 presentation with President George H.W. Bush, who declared that the turkey “will not end up on anyone’s dinner table, not this guy – he’s presented a presidential pardon as of right now – and allow him to live out his days on a children’s farm not far from here.”Since then, 60 turkeys have been pardoned and saved from ending up on Thanksgiving dinner tables. The American people also get involved with the tradition, including this year, by choosing the names of the turkeys to be pardoned. Gobble and Waddle’s names were selected via an online poll sent out on social media by the Office of the First Lady.Iowa Couple Reveals How They Finally Escaped Their TimeshareSilverPenny | AdAdUndoSeniors Born 1939-1969 Receive 11 Benefits This Month If They AskSuper Saving Online | AdAdUndoHouseholds With 2+ Vehicles Should Be Doing ThisTired of high premiums?

        "text": "It's still more than a month until Zohran Mamdani becomes mayor, but already he's made some moves in the transition that have some people worried. Last week a mob of activists held a protest outside a synagogue in Manhattan. Mamdani may not be the mayor but people wanted to know how he would react, especially given that this particular mob seemed like his people.\n\nA rowdy protest descended last Wednesday on Park East Synagogue, one of New York’s most prominent Modern Orthodox congregations, which had rented space to an organization that helps Jews move to Israel as well as to settlements in the occupied West Bank. Chants of “death to the I.D.F.” and “globalize the intifada” rang through the air.Mr. Mamdani, the mayor-elect, responded the next day, saying through a spokeswoman that he “discouraged the language” used at the protest and that New Yorkers must be “free to enter a house of worship without intimidation.”But it was what he said next that alarmed some Jewish leaders: He chastised the synagogue, saying through his spokeswoman that “these sacred spaces should not be used to promote activities in violation of international law.”\n\nThis seems to be a tic from his loudmouth activist days. But with only a month to go, it's probably time to lay off the references to international law and start concerning yourself with US and New York law. Mamdani was elected mayor, not president. Someone must have talked to him because yesterday he issued a second statement minus the commentary on international law.\n\n“We will protect New Yorkers’ First Amendment rights while making clear that nothing can justify language calling for ‘death to’ anyone,” Mr. Mamdani said in a statement to The New York Times. “It is unacceptable, full stop.”\n\nIn any case, his first answer left some Jewish leaders less than impressed.\n\nA synagogue is where Jews learn, pray, and strengthen Jewish life. Teaching about aliyah and Zionism belongs in that space. It reflects who we are as a people.Mayor-Elect Mamdani’s claim that Park East “misused” a sacred space by hosting an aliyah program crosses a clear line.… https://t.co/L3I9HbH4Km— William Daroff (@Daroff) November 23, 2025\n\nSince then, Mamdani has spoken by phone with the rabbi of this synagogue, Arthur Schneier, who recommended a law preventing protests outside synagogues. We'll have to wait and see where that goes.\n\nMeanwhile, Mamdani is also gearing up his transition team. He seems to be trying to reassure his DSA buddies that he's still part of the team.\n\nNew York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani announced Monday the creation of 17 transition advisory committees made up of more than 400 people to help advise his incoming administration on policy and appointments, and to help him chart a new course for city government...The Mamdani team will have the expected committees on transportation and public safety, for example, but he will also have two committees that have not been part of other mayoral transitions, including one on worker justice and another on community organizing...\"If you are a card-carrying member of the DSA, you're concerned today that maybe the guy that rose to the mayor's position with your support is turning on you. So it's important that he says to them, I'm still one of you, I got your back,\" [Prof.] Polanco said. \n\nOne of Mamdani's picks for his Community Safety Committee ought to also be raising some concerns with the NYPD.\n\nAlex Vitale, a Brooklyn College sociology professor, was among those tapped on Monday to help staff Mamdani’s committee on community safety amid the mayoral turnover...The liberal professor is behind a 2017 anti-cop book — titled “The End of Policing” — that decries “broken windows” and other proactive policies...Vitale has long argued against the broken-windows policing — claiming the NYPD has disproportionately and unjustifiably targeted minority communities in the past.\n\nVitale goes beyond criticizing broken-windows policing. He sees police as \"class enemies.\"\n\n🚨 Mamdani’s Transition Team Now Includes a Professor Who Calls Police “Class Enemies.”Professor Alex Vitale explained on a DSA call that cops are “the natural enemy of the working class” and that individual officers do not matter because the structure itself neutralizes their… pic.twitter.com/ADMahXmdRE— Stu Smith (@thestustustudio) November 25, 2025\n\nHe's still advocating for and end to policing, which he calls \"violence work.\" He recommends an alternative called \"pod mapping\" which is even dumber than it sounds.\n\n🚨 “Kill the Cop in Our Head”: Mamdani Transition Pick Rejects Reform, Calls Policing “Violence Work,” and Advocates for \"Pod Mapping\"Zohran Mamdani just appointed Professor Alex Vitale to his community safety transition team.Vitale says it plainly, “Policing is about… pic.twitter.com/jvwgh3CUt6— Stu Smith (@thestustustudio) November 25, 2025\n\nIf you want to read all about pod mapping, you can do that here by reading the source document. The basic idea is that instead of police to deal with violence, rape, etc. you'd sketch out a network of friends and trusted individuals to handle those crimes instead. I encourage you to read it because the paper itself really suggests the idea can't possibly work as most people don't have a network large enough to do much of anything. Of course this is all blamed on capitalism which gives you an idea where this whole thing is coming from.\n\nMost people have few solid, dependable relationships in their lives. Much of this is from the breaking of relationships, isolation, fear and criminalization that capitalism requires. We found that for many people, mapping their pod was a sobering process, as many thought their pod would be larger than it actually was.\n\nThe best part of the dumb paper is the fact that the author refers to these social justice collectives as \"pod people\" which seems like a dead accurate way to describe the fringe whackos who are taking this seriously.\n\nHonestly, the idea that this 6-page paper (and one full page is a picture) could replace traditional policing in a city of 8 million is so absurd that any person suggesting it should be mocked and ridiculed in public.\n\nThe fact that Mamdani selected Prof. Vitale to be a leader on the city's community safety commission (along with Louis Farrakhan fan Tamika Mallory) ought to worry all of the people who live in NYC. Your safety is not being taken seriously.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Hot Air's conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

        "text": "The national Republican party is doubling down on its strategy of tying socialist New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani to Democrats in midterm elections following President Donald Trump’s friendly Oval Office meeting with him, The Daily Signal has learned.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee issued a memo shortly before Mamdani’s win detailing the party’s plan to “weaponize” Mamdani against Democrats. But on Friday, Trump came away from his meeting with Mamdani saying he is “very confident” the socialist can do a “very good job” in New York City. \n\nThrough Trump previously threatened to pull federal funding from New York if Mamdani won, he said, “I expect to be helping him, not hurting him.”\n\nHowever, a GOP campaign strategist said Republicans still plan to hold Mamdani’s feet to the fire.\n\n“We’re still going to attack him, especially when he gets into office,” the campaign strategist said. “He has all of these extreme radicals he’s surrounding himself with. He’s going to be incredibly incompetent, so we plan on definitely making Democrats answer for that.”\n\nThe source said Trump looked strong and gracious in the Oval Office meeting, and it was clear Mamdani knows he needs a relationship with Trump. The mayor-elect presented himself as someone that could work with Trump, but the Republican party is ready to “fire away” on Mamdani when he begins his term and starts being “incompetent” and a “radical extremist.”\n\n“Trump can be gracious to many people, but going forward, the minute that he tries to implement communist policies, Republicans on all sides are going to make sure that we hold him accountable for that,” the strategist said, “and we hold all Democrats accountable for that.”\n\nTrump’s change of tune with Mamdani will spark “no changes” to the GOP’s midterm strategy, another national Republican strategist told The Daily Signal.\n\nTrump kicked off a smart strategy of starting his relationship with Mamdani with a bipartisan push to make New York safer and more affordable. Mamdani recognized that the president loves New York and would like to be friends with the new mayor and charmed him, the strategist said.\n\nBut it won’t take long for the country to see how ineffective and dangerous Mamdani’s policies are, and the GOP will be quick to push back on socialism and tie Mamdani to other Democrat candidates. \n\nRep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who is challenging Democrat New York Gov. Kathy Hochul in midterms, has pressed hard on her opponent’s connection to socialist Mamdani. \n\nA reporter asked Trump if he agreed with Stefanik’s claim that Mamdani is a jihadist.\n\n“No I don’t,” Trump responded. “You say things sometimes in a campaign,” Trump said of Stefanik. “She’s a very capable person.”\n\nStefanik doesn’t think Mamdani and Trump’s love fest complicates her messaging, she said in a a local news interview. \n\n“I strongly believe that Zohran Mamdani is catastrophic for the people of New York City and really for the people of New York State, particularly when you consider the fact that New York City and the greater New York City region is home to more Jewish families than any other part of the world outside of Israel,” she said.\n\n“You have Zohran Mamdani, who is a defund-the-police, tax-hiking socialist who has campaigned with an unindicted co-conspirator of terrorist attacks, including the 1993 World Trade Center bombing that killed New Yorkers,” she continued. “So, I stand by my statement: He is a jihadist, and this is an area where President Trump and I disagree.”",

Working with Phil felt seamless—our instincts were so similar, and we always seemed to be in sync.”\n\nLater in the piece, she wrote, “I had been expecting him to die since the day he started using again, but when it finally happened it hit me with brutal force.”\n\nReports swirled of a separation in the final months of Hoffman’s life, who is survived by O’Donnell and their children, Cooper, now 22, Tallulah, 18, and Willa, 16. \n\nC.K., meanwhile, has had a very different trial of his own, admitting to multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against women in 2017. \n\nThe father of two became the center of a New York Times article detailing the allegations of five women against him. \n\nHaving previously rebuked rumors in the past, he admitted to claims he had exposed himself after inviting women for a nightcap. \n\n“These stories are true,” C.K., real name Louis Szekely, said the morning after the story broke. \n\nHis admission and subsequent exile from the public eye proved fatal for his movie, I Love You, Daddy, which was ultimately aborted. \n\nDuring the saga, C.K.’s former colleague Tig Notaro told the Daily Beast in an interview in 2017 they’d had “an incident,” adding, “We don’t talk since then.”\n\nA year prior, fellow comedian Roseanne Barr told the Daily Beast she had heard stories about the comedian’s inappropriate behaviour for years. “It’s Louis C.K., locking the door and masturbating in front of women comics and writers. I can’t tell you—I’ve heard so many stories. Not just him, but a lot of them. And it’s just par for the course. It’s just s--t women have to put up with.”\n\nIn a follow-up email, she added, “These allegations [against Louis C.K.] have been leveled and talked about for years. I do not have first-hand knowledge, though I have heard women make these allegations.”\n\nC.K., who was married to Alix Bailey until 2005, has been slowly reconstructing his career since 2019, to mixed reactions from the stand-up circuit. \n\nHe has a show Tuesday at New York’s Beacon Theater, which is sold out, as is another show on Wednesday, November 26. So too are his next seven shows in San Diego, Los Angeles, Long Beach, and San Francisco. \n\nIn October, he made his public return to TV in an appearance on Bill Maher’s show Real Time with Bill Maher, eight years after the allegations. \n\nIt comes off the back of him performing at the controversial Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia for government officials. Also in the lineup for the festival were the likes of Dave Chappelle, Bill Burr, and Kevin Hart. \n\n“I mean, how do you even promote that?” Marc Maron said, admonishing those deciding to perform. “‘From the folks that brought you 9/11. Two weeks of laughter in the desert, don’t miss it!’ \n\n“I mean, the same guy that’s gonna pay them is the same guy that paid that guy to bone-saw Jamal Khashoggi and put him in a f--king suitcase. But don’t let that stop the yucks, it’s gonna be a good time!”\n\nO’Donnell made headlines of her own in the fall, standing up as an early advocate of New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. \n\nSpeaking to the New York Post ahead of his successful election campaign, she said, “I love a progressive candidate. He’s got the energy. I love free child care, free buses.”",

First Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro said Adams plans to appoint and reappoint several members to the rental board before he steps down at year-end and is considering candidates who have put their names forward to fill vacant spots. The mayor could secure a majority of appointees whose terms would extend beyond Adams’s final days in office, Mastro said in an interview.

        "text": "If anyone needed proof of how swiftly political change can arrive, this fall is probably Example A.\n\nJust observe the last month. First, California Gov. Gavin Newsom was riding high after passage of Proposition 50 and its changes in California congressional district lines made him the most successful national Democrat in countering a key initiative by President Trump.\n\nBarely a week later, Newsom’s former chief of staff was indicted on charges of political corruption and tax fraud and many began to write him off as a presidential candidate because of it.\n\nNot even a week after that, Newsom was back in the catbird seat after a federal appeals court in Texas threw out that state’s gerrymandered congressional district plan – which earlier provided the motive for the Newsom-sponsored Prop. 50. The U.S. Supreme Court days later temporarily reinstated the gerrymandered Texas lines.\n\nIt now appears the Texas decision nixing the changes there may be reversed by the high court, even though it was written by a Trump-appointed judge. Meanwhile the California proposition figures to survive its own court challenges, filed by the state Republican Party and the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nThat’s because Texas officials from Gov. Greg Abbott down were open about their effort to concentrate Houston-area blacks into one district while giving five others to white Republicans. By contrast, there was little or no mention of race by either side in the Prop. 50 campaign, which was very explicitly motivated by pure politics.\n\nNewsom created Prop. 50 specifically to counter the Texas gerrymander, which unlike California’s changes in district lines, was not adopted by a vote of the people. No race issue ever arose here until Republicans claimed after Prop. 50’s resounding win that was what motivated it.\n\nNothing says the U.S. Supreme Court has to give a final OK to either the Texas court decision or Prop. 50, but if it eventually tosses both gerrymanders, Newsom would still achieve his political goal of offsetting the Texas changes put in motion by a phone call from Trump to Abbott. If both efforts are eventually nixed, Newsom’s goal of regaining the prior balance after the Texas action would still have been reached.\n\nSaid one election law professor the day of the Texas decision, “There are not many grounds for a legal challenge against Prop. 50 to succeed.”\n\nThere remains a possibility that both Prop. 50 and the Texas court decision tossing that state’s gerrymander will stand up in the Supreme Court. If that happens, Newsom would have achieved far more than his goal of balancing the Texas gerrymander with an exchange of five new California Democratic seats for five new Texas GOP ones. In that case, Newsom would have given Democrats a net gain of five seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nIf something like that couldn’t put Newsom in an early lead in the 2028 Democratic presidential sweepstakes, it’s hard to see what could. A net gain of five seats would likely give Democrats control of the House, where almost all new Trump initiatives might then die.\n\nNo wonder Newsom gloating after the Texas court decision came down. In a post on X, he said, “Donald Trump and Greg Abbott played with fire, got burned, and democracy won.” For a moment.\n\nFor Newsom took a turn toward the center in his bill signings this fall, favoring business in many of his decisions.\n\nHis fall efforts were clearly designed to stamp him as a moderate, but also an environmentalist with a tight financial fist.\n\nThis could leave him open to a challenge from the left by someone like New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has built a career around leading her party’s far-left wing.\n\nThat possibility gained credence from the New York mayoral win of Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani and the subsequent upset win by fellow Democratic Socialist Katie Wilson and a slate of similarly-oriented candidates in Seattle.\n\nThe bottom line: Newsom may be riding high today, but in a season of very speedy change, no one can know how long that will last.\n\nEmail Thomas Elias at tdelias@aol.com.",

        "text": "Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said this week that she has no interest in a friendly meet-up with President Donald Trump, unlike New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. \n\nMamdani, the young Democratic Socialist who shocked the political world this year, dominated headlines on Friday after meeting with Trump in the White House. Despite the fact that Mamdani railed against Trump on the campaign trail, the president showed surprising warmness toward Mamdani in a joint press conference in the Oval Office after their meeting.\n\nWu was asked if she would be open to a similar type of meeting with Trump during a turkey distribution event in Jamaica Plain Monday. She offered a blunt response. \n\n“I’m not interested in a bromance with the federal regime,” Wu said, per The Boston Globe. \n\nWu’s disdain for the Trump administration is nothing new. In the spring, Wu’s strong performance during a hearing in front of many Trump-friendly GOP lawmakers in Washington amplified her national profile. Federal officials continued to antagonize her over the city’s immigration enforcement policies throughout the year, allowing Wu to take a defiant stance that played well in a city that largely dislikes the president. \n\nShe cruised through a reelection campaign and secured a second term, during which there will undoubtedly be plenty more opportunities for resistance. The Wu administration is amid a continuous effort to obtain information about ICE activity, and is facing a lawsuit from the Trump administration challenging the legality of a local law that limits how Boston police can assist ICE. State Attorney General Andrea Campbell got involved in that case this week. ICE has ramped up enforcement activities in Boston this year, most recently drawing ire from Wu and residents over the raid of a car wash in Allston. \n\nMamdani and Wu are both young progressives tasked with leading major cities in an era when the Democratic Party is looking for new leaders. After her big 2025, Wu is increasingly being held up as a model for Democratic governance nationwide. Mamdani is on record as being a big fan of Wu, calling her the most effective Democrat in the country during a debate earlier this year. She offered praise after Mamdani’s electoral victories this year, and the two have had brief phone conversations. \n\nMamdani’s campaign was based heavily on a few core progressive policies, and he will have to show voters that he is aggressively working toward them once he takes office in January. New York City could have a larger target on its back than Boston, and a protracted fight with the Trump administration would derail Mamdani’s momentum and potentially cause fissures in his support. \n\nDuring their surprisingly cordial meeting, Mamdani and Trump largely sidestepped talk about immigration and other hot-button issues. Antagonism between the two could ramp up again at any moment, but for now Mamdani is enjoying general praise for seemingly delaying actions like Trump sending the National Guard to New York City. \n\nWu has a different calculus in mind. \n\n“From my point of view, flattery is not the way,” she said, according to the Globe. “I think Boston residents want to stand strong on our values and to get things done and to keep moving forward, and that’s what we’re going to continue to do.”\n\nWu did not directly attack Mamdani, and was clear that every leader and community must make their own decisions in deciding how to navigate a tense political moment. \n\nWu is open to meeting the president, but only if his administration makes major changes, she said. \n\n“If it came with a promise to stop snatching residents illegally off the streets, stop prosecuting his political enemies, stop cutting life-saving research and funding?” she said. “Sure, I would be open to a conversation at that point.”",

        "text": "New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has appointed a university professor who has described police officers as “violence workers” to serve on his community safety committee.\n\nMamdani announced Monday that Alex Vitale, a sociology professor at Brooklyn College, will advise his incoming administration on community safety matters. Vitale has a long history of disparaging police, calling them the “natural enemy” of the working class, and advocating for defunding law enforcement.\n\nThe appointment casts fresh doubt on the mayor-elect‘s attempt to distance himself from his own past remarks calling for the defunding of the New York Police Department (NYPD), which he labeled a “racist, anti-queer and a major threat to public safety.” (RELATED: Blue City ‘Violence Prevention’ Activists Keep Catching Violent Charges)\n\nVitale referred to individual officers as “class enemies” during a 2020 interview with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) when asked where police fit into the “class struggle.”\n\nHis 2017 book, “The End of Policing,” argues that the “problem is not police training, police diversity, or police methods. The problem is policing itself.”\n\n“The whole point is they’re violence workers. You can’t train them not to be violence workers,” Vitale said during a separate 2020 interview in which he argued that police cannot be reformed.\n\nLike Mamdani, Vitale has stated that the “institution of policing exists historically to facilitate racial inequality… emerging out of colonialism, slavery, and industrial capitalism.”\n\nThe professor also advocates decriminalizing so-called “sex work” or prostitution and produced a 2025 film titled “Sex Work: It’s Just a Job.”\n\nVitale is one of roughly 400 advisors who will serve across 17 committees ahead of Mamdani’s January inauguration.\n\n“A love for hard work, a deep belief in the promise of New York City, and a commitment to the affordability agenda that New Yorkers are demanding unite the more than 400 experts we have appointed to our Transition Committees today,” Mamdani said on Monday. “By helping us recruit top talent and develop smart policy, these committees will be instrumental to ensuring we hit the ground running on January 1st — and that our results align with the promises we’ve made.”\n\nMamdani has insisted in recent months that he no longer supports defunding the NYPD. He also apologized to officers during an October Fox News interview for past disparaging comments, saying he is committed to “representing the men and women of the NYPD.”\n\n“I apologize because of the fact that I’m looking to work with these officers, and I know that these officers, these men and women who serve in the NYPD, they put their lives on the line every single day,” Mamdani said.\n\nVitale’s views, however, are consistent with positions held by the DSA, of which Mamdani is a member. The group calls on the country to “end the criminalization of working-class survival,” “invest in community self-governance and care, not cops” and provide “freedom for all incarcerated people.”\n\n“For all of the working class to achieve collective liberation, we must constrain, diminish, and abolish the carceral forces of the state — from prisons and police themselves, to their manifestations in all forms throughout society,” the DSA’s website says.\n\nAs recently as December 2024, Mamdani called for cuts to funding for the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group, the unit that responded to the killing of Officer Didarul Islam.\n\nMeanwhile, NYPD data shows that misdemeanors, “major” felonies and non-major felonies in New York City have been more frequent every year since 2020.\n\nNeither Mamdani nor Vitale responded to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

        "text": "School daze\n\n“Schools of Hope” in Florida has now been given the right to feed at the taxpayer trough. The plan to fill empty seats in district schools at no cost is akin to moving into your neighbor’s home rent-free, as the spare bedroom is available.\n\nThis is another step in the shortsighted play to bust unions, selectively shift curriculum and classroom/library resources, hold down pay and benefits and now, give away student seats. This is the old Jeb Bush effort toward defunding school districts and privatizing Florida public education.\n\nFlori-Duh is on display with the dismantling of public school districts in favor of the profitable business of education. The free lunch is alive and well for charter school power brokers.\n\nGeorge Ellis,\n\nLocal hysteria\n\nRe: Mary Anna Mancuso’s Nov. 16 op-ed, “Miami GOP is right to sound the alarm on Mamdani.” I am always intrigued by how quickly Miami’s Cuban community calls “communism” on anyone with progressive politics.\n\nCuba has never had sustained democratic rule. Post independence, it staggered from one corrupt administration to another, interspersed with various U.S. interventions:\n\n1898-1902, United States military rule;\n\n1906-1909, United States Marine occupation;\n\n1912, to suppress Afro-Cuban demonstrations in eastern Cuba;\n\n1917-1922, Marines deployed to “protect” U.S. interests in the Sugar Intervention.\n\nFulgencio Batista, facing electoral loss in 1952, staged a coup, suspended the Constitution of 1940 and ushered in a de facto military dictatorship marked by suppression of free speech, disappearance of political opponents and corruption aligned with American organized crime. His right-wing dictatorial regime set the table for the left-wing dictatorial Castro regime that followed.\n\nYet, faced with an American president who refused to accept an electoral loss, tried to overthrow the 2020 election by asking the Georgia Secretary of State to find “11,780 votes” and whose supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, there is zero sense of dread among Miami Cubans, who should be well aware that a right-wing dictatorship is no better than a left-wing dictatorship.\n\nThe prospect of encroaching authoritarianism must alarm us, even if so-called conservative Republicans embrace it. Miamians have nothing to fear from the mayor-elect of New York and his policies. It is “red-scare” politics to suggest otherwise.\n\nLorraine Dowdy,\n\nGet onboard\n\nWhy do the Miami Herald and WLRN radio have such a vendetta against Brightline?\n\nThe Nov. 16 front page story, “Private train, public cash: How Brightline has been buoyed by Florida taxpayer dollars,” featured three pages bemoaning public investment – and the very unfortunate, but also very avoidable, deaths.\n\nEveryone I know who has ridden the train has positive comments. It’s faster and safer than driving, quite comfortable and you’re able to get work done while traveling. Anyone would be in favor of removing some of the unbelievable traffic on our overcrowded highways.\n\nAs for public investment, I have no problem with my tax dollars doing good for the local region. I could easily provide three pages of things I don’t want my tax dollars doing.\n\nJohn Saviano,\n\nMiami Beach\n\nLocal history\n\nThe Nov. 16 In Depth cover story, “Change of venue,” on the new Miami-Dade County civil courthouse, was comprehensive and terrific. While the focus was on the naming of same for the late Osvaldo Soto, there was no mention of the parallel and unsuccessful effort to dedicate the courthouse to the late and longtime Clerk of County Courts Harvey Ruvin.\n\nHarvey, a good friend who served in public office for more than 30 years, was universally respected; his funeral was held at Dade County Auditorium, after all. The groundswell of support to name the new courthouse for Harvey lost out to the efforts of those supporting Soto. It’s a done deal.\n\nThe North Dade Justice Center and the street fronting the downtown courthouse will honor Harvey and bring some measure of relief to the community. Both men brought honor to their respective communities; both men’s memories are blessings.\n\nMichael D. Orovitz,\n\nBay Harbor Islands\n\nTrash tragedy\n\nOur Miami-Dade County commissioners are fixated on building a new incinerator to replace one that burned down in 2023. However, they can’t decide which neighborhood wants the garbage burning in their backyard.\n\nIf you live in a municipality that is willing to sacrifice people’s health and property values, please let your commissioners know. If not, then maybe you should ask them why aren’t we implementing a zero waste strategy that eliminates the need for incineration and saves the $1.5 billion cost to build one. It’s time for innovation, not incineration.\n\nNoel Cleland,\n\n‘People’s plight’\n\nRe: Mary Anna Mancuso’s Nov. 16 op-ed, “Miami GOP is right to sound the alarm on Mamdani.” Like U.S. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, I was born in Cuba and experienced the Castro takeover.\n\nMancuso however, didn’t address the real issue — the failure of President Trump and the GOP to help the poorest and most vulnerable in our community. The GOP has done nothing to address the huge income inequality and rising affordability crisis. It has done everything to deny working class Americans health care, a basic human right.\n\nThe wages of gardeners, teachers and trash collectors, among others, are insufficient to provide families adequate shelter, food and medical care. Republicans’ answer is to provide huge tax breaks to corporations and wealthy Americans and throw lavish Halloween parties while denying poor Americans SNAP benefits during the government shutdown.\n\nZohran Mamdani was elected mayor of New York City because he addressed the people’s plight. Americans will turn to leaders who recognize and address their concerns and offer solutions that allow them to provide for their families’ freedom, food, shelter and health care. Unless we do this, we will end like the Roman and British empires.\n\nSergio Fernandez,\n\nCoral Gables\n\nScary thought\n\nI’m a lifelong Democrat. When U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican, appears on national television and makes more sense than all the leaders of the Democratic Party, it is truly frightening.\n\nEric P. Littman,\n\nInspiring name\n\nI was saddened to read about the death of Seth Gordon. I was director of development for New World School of the Arts (NWSA) for five years when Seth was its chairman. He was a creative force and fun to be around. It’s one thing to have creative ideas, but it takes real leadership to bring them to fruition.\n\nSeth wanted to create a version of New York City’s “Fame School” in Miami. He successfully shepherded his idea through the Florida Legislature, creating the NWSA. If the NWSA board named the lobby or a significant performance space in his honor, it would be a fitting tribute.\n\nDoug Mayer,\n\nCoral Gables\n\nRapport building\n\nOne of the great lines in the iconic film, “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, is “Who are those guys?” That line resonates in my mind often. As a good woke liberal (redundant, I know), I find that in most meetings I attend, the implicit and sometimes explicit suggestion is that they are open to getting to know the other side. That is not the case.\n\nI call on bookstores, liberal churches and other venues that have hosted programs promoting my political bent to bring in the “other side” to voice their worldview. Finding out “who are those guys” does not mean you are endorsing their views; it does mean you are making an honest effort to find out.\n\nSid Kaskey,\n\nSouth Miami\n\nFloating library\n\nThe Presidential Library, which will be built on Biscayne Boulevard, will be a fitting tribute to Donald Trump and his presidency.\n\nOf course, it will have to be built on stilts, because after a hundred years of rising sea levels, the Atlantic Ocean will be lapping at its foundation and, in the distance, Miami Beach will be just a memory.\n\nJames Gross,\n\nNational Hurricane Center meteorologist,\n\nSouth Miami",

        "text": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday that New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is the leader of the Democratic Party during an interview on Tuesday. Speaking to CNBC host Andrew Ross Sorkin, Bessent said, \"I was in the room, and I think that you’ve got to have some admiration for a candidate who ran a campaign the way he did. It was a great, great campaign.\" \"He is clearly the leader of the Democratic Party now. And I think it speaks to how open-minded the president is, that he invited him into the Oval,\" Bessent said. The treasury secretary pointed out that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., did not endorse Mamdani in the mayoral race. Other key New York Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Gov. Kathy Hochul, did endorse the mayor-elect. DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST CALLS MAMDANI'S TRUMP MEETING 'WEAK' AFTER TOUGH CAMPAIGN TALK \"President Trump wants the best for New Yorkers,\" Bessent added. \"I can tell you, my impression of the mayor-elect is he’s a young man with a lot of old ideas that have never worked. Point to one example where policies like his have led to anything other than a decline.\" He also said it was easy to run a campaign, but actually governing — \"keeping people safe, picking up the trash, making the subways run on time\" — was a whole other challenge. \"We'll see,\" Bessent added. SCOTT BESSENT CONFRONTS GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS FOR LABELING GOP 'TERRORISTS' DURING 1995 GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN Sorkin also asked Democratic strategist James Carville about who he saw as the leader of the party, noting Bessent's argument that it was Mamdani. \"No one represents the party. The only person that can represent the party is a presidential nominee, who will be chosen by the party members who vote in the primaries,\" Carville argued. Trump said Mamdani was a \"rational person\" during a press conference after their meeting on Friday.

He really ran an incredible race against, you know, a lot of smart people, starting with the early primaries against some very tough people, very smart people. And he beat them, and he beat them easily. And I congratulated him, and we talked about some things in very strong common, like housing and getting housing built and food and prices.\"",

        "text": "New York’s infamous ‘Hole’ neighborhood in East New York is slated for resiliency upgrades, a rezoning, and more housing.\n\nWhen you walk south down Ruby Street, from Conduit Boulevard to Linden Boulevard in the easternmost bit of Brooklyn, you descend 10 feet.\n\nThat 12-block depression that straddles the Brooklyn-Queens border has been infamously dubbed “The Hole” because it sits below the other land around it—and it’s not connected to the city’s sewer system.\n\nEvery time it rains, the streets flood. And so do the homes of the neighborhood residents.\n\n“I get three feet of water in my basement,” said Jimmy, a north Jewel Streets resident who preferred to go only by his first name.\n\nAfter decades of neglect, local community groups are optimistic about a city plan to transform the neighborhood.\n\nThe $146 million project will build sewers, add a chain of ponds for rainwater to flow to Jamaica Bay, and unlock the development of as many as 5,000 units of housing.\n\nThe proposal finally has momentum after community groups pushed the city’s Department of Environmental Protection, Housing Preservation and Development, and local councilmembers to take action.\n\n“For far too long, this community has gone without basic infrastructure, fending for themselves in the face of constant flooding, faulty septic systems, and rampant illegal dumping. Today, we move towards a more livable, resilient future for the neighborhood,” said Meredith McNair, senior community planner with the Cypress Hills Local Development Corporation when the plan was announced.\n\nFrom ‘The Hole’ to the Jewel Streets\n\nWhen you walk through The Hole, you hear the splash of tires splitting puddles of water, trucks rumbling by—even goats bleating.\n\nBut in between those moments of chaos, there’s peace.\n\n“It’s like the country down here,” said Jimmy.\n\nThe streets, once asphalt, are a dusty mix of storm runoff and dirt on a good day. After a rain, the roads are completely inundated with floodwater.\n\nFor decades, it’s been a free-for-all in The Hole. Illegal industrial businesses operate on some of the vacant lots, sending loud trucks down streets that are intended just for residential use.\n\n“Do you know how long I’ve been complaining about this? I don’t make any noise,” said Jimmy. He’s lived in the Jewel streets all his life, and said he’s seen the gamut of businesses and hustlers making use of the vacant lots.\n\n“There was a bus company, yellow bus company, five o’clock in the morning, you would hear backup alarms,” he said. Another adjoining property, he says, “ended up becoming a parking lot for the airport. All hours of the night, there were people here beeping.”\n\nFor decades, the Department of Environmental Protection had funding for sewer construction in The Hole. But the city hadn’t been able to push the project forward.\n\nIn 2022, residents sent a letter to the Adams administration demanding change, kicking off two years of community engagement.\n\n“We were pissed off. Angry. Just because we were left so many years unheard. We felt like the retaining wall at the dead end street, just trapped, like we didn’t exist,” said Julisa Rodriguez, who lives at the south end of Sapphire street with her children.\n\nThe East New York Community Land Trust and the Cypress Hills Development Corporation led the organizing effort, knocking on doors, convening residents, and negotiating with the city. They asserted their desire for a true neighborhood.\n\nHannah Anousheh, director of the East New York CLT, called it a “masterclass” in working with—but also pushing—the city.\n\n“We have to give them credit… but at the same time they have to constantly be pushed and constantly be told they have to listen to residents,” said Anousheh.\n\nSince then, things have improved modestly. The city added catch basins in the ground to absorb some of the flooding—but it still takes the streets a day or two to drain.\n\nThe city also started cracking down on businesses operating illegally on the streets that were causing disturbances.\n\nAfter two years, the plan that emerged was not for The Hole but reimagined as the Jewel Streets—named after Sapphire, Amber, Emerald, and Ruby streets that run North to South through the neighborhood.\n\n‘Blue belts’ and buyouts\n\nTo fix the Jewel Streets, planners are fighting nature itself.\n\n“Our sewer system runs on gravity,” said Michael Sandler, associate commissioner for neighborhood strategies at HPD.\n\nThe Hole follows the path of what was once Spring Creek—which has since been paved over. But water still yearns to run through the historic channel. When it can’t flow, it sits below sea level in The Hole.\n\nWith more frequent, more severe storms from a changing climate, the flooding is getting worse.\n\nNot being part of the sewer system also presents unique challenges, Sandler added. “When they flush their toilet, it just drains into the yard next to their house, and that dirt has standing water, so septic stuff flows back out into the neighborhood because of the grade.”\n\nA plan to manage stormwater will create two ponds on the north side of Linden Boulevard that will collect rain. Then the water will flow under Linden, and get pumped up to Spring Creek, which empties into Jamaica Bay.\n\nWith water runoff managed in a “blue-belt” that will recreate and uncover the path of the historic Spring Creek, the city can then raise the below-grade streets, unlocking the potential for new development.\n\n“Resiliency and quality of life investments for the residents of the Jewel Streets, will allow thousands of new homes, including a very significant amount of affordable housing,” said Sandler.\n\nThat will leave many of the neighborhood’s existing homes several feet below the new street—requiring adaptation lest they continue to be at significant flooding risk.\n\nIn the Jewel Streets, the city is testing its first ever pre-disaster buyout program. Usually, the government only offers buyouts after a disaster happens—like it did after Hurricane Sandy. \n\nBut knowing that the neighborhood will flood again, officials are seeking to be proactive, offering Jewel Streets homeowners the option of having the city purchase their land. \n\nA new neighborhood\n\nWhen all of that’s built—which could take years, planners say—the Jewel Streets will finally have the ingredients of a new neighborhood.\n\nThe city wants to rezone more than 20 blocks to facilitate the development of new housing, activate commercial strips, and bring more amenities to the community.\n\nThe area is a 15 minute walk from two subway stations at Grant Avenue on the North side of Conduit Boulevard and Euclid Avenue in East New York.\n\nPlanners also want to add passenger islands for the B55 bus route, and more pedestrian crossings on busy Linden Boulevard.\n\nA 17 acre city site on the south side of the street will continue the blue belt, with more ponds connecting to Jamaica Bay. The rest of the land will support up to 1,400 new homes.\n\nFacilitating that development will require navigating the city’s often-contested land use process, where residents will continue to weigh in, as well as local councilmembers.\n\nThe area straddles both Brooklyn and Queens, represented by Brooklyn Councilmember Chris Banks and Queens Councilmember Joann Ariola. \n\n“I think the plan is a good plan as it is now,” said Banks, who is cautiously optimistic about the rezoning. \n\nAriola declined to comment on this story.\n\nThe rezoning process wouldn’t kick off until 2026, when Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani will be in office. Mamdani did not respond to a request for comment on the proposal.\n\n“We just need to make sure that the next administration has continuity and a commitment to deliver those funds so that we can get this over the finish line,” said Banks.\n\nAfter years of broken promises, residents of the Jewel Streets are allowing themselves to hope, just a little bit.\n\n“We’re heading in the right direction. There’s still a lot of unknowns, still a lot of questions,” said Rodriguez.\n\nSome organizers are calling to put some of the land into a community land trust that would be resident-controlled condominiums, with an option for existing residents to move into new, permanently affordable homes.\n\nRodriguez told City Limits that, if she gets a fair price, she plans to take the city’s buyout offer and look for another home—though she worries she may not be able to afford New York City prices.\n\nShe said the buyout would be the best thing for her family and her children.\n\n“I envision the plan finally being implemented, although for me, I would prefer to relocate,” said Rodriguez. \n\n“I can’t hide my sentiments of seeing a beautiful Jewel neighborhood, a place of equality and diversity, beautiful homes, sidewalks, trees, colorful flowers, gardens, the smell of fresh grass rather than sewage, children playing in a dry, paved street and making new friends. A tight knit community with all the essentials that others take for granted.”\n\nTo reach the reporter behind this story, contact [email protected].

        "text": "The far-left push within the Democratic Party, highlighted by mayoral victories by socialist candidates in New York City and Seattle, is poised to be a major factor in several key battleground House races as several candidates carrying the progressive mantle hold strong positions in Democratic primaries. Several of the most competitive House races in the country feature candidates putting to the test whether progressive policies can appeal to voters outside deep blue urban centers, including in California’s 22nd Congressional District, where Democrat Randy Villegas is running to unseat Republican Rep. David Valadao. \"Bernie and I share the same goal: to make life more affordable for working families,\" Villegas said in a statement after being endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a self-described \"democratic socialist.\" \"He has dedicated his life to putting power in the hands of ordinary Americans instead of the ultra-rich, and I’m excited to work together to fight for our communities here in the Central Valley and across the country.\" In addition to being endorsed by Sanders, who endorsed New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, Villegas has employed the Fight Agency advertising firm, among others, which is led by operatives who also helped Mamdani cruise to victory earlier this month. SOCIALIST WAVE SPREADS COAST-TO-COAST AS PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS RALLY AROUND ZOHRAN MAMDANI'S NYC WIN Fox News Digital reported this week that Fight Agency is also working to defeat two vulnerable House Republicans in Pennsylvania, Reps. Rob Bresnahan and Ryan Mackenzie. Villegas, endorsed by the progressive Working Families Party that endorsed Mamdani, is currently running in a Democratic primary against California state Assemblywoman Jasmeet Bains, who was recruited by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and currently is sitting on less cash on hand than Villegas. \"Here in the Central Valley, we couldn't care less about political labels,\" Villegas said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"We care about being able to see a doctor without going bankrupt and being able to feed our families without needing a second job. We're sick of politicians in both parties selling us out to billionaires and corporations. Any politician who isn't fighting for working families like our lives depends on it needs to get out of the way.\" In Colorado’s 8th Congressional District, GOP Rep. Gabe Evans is being challenged by another progressive Democrat, Manny Rutinel, in what is expected to be one of the tightest House races next November. Rutinel, who serves as a Colorado state representative, who was reportedly spotted alongside Mamdani and holds a large fundraising lead over his Democrat opponents, has associated himself with a variety of far-left groups and politicians, including Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Townhall reported. Rutinel has been endorsed by progressive groups like CHC Bold PAC and Latino Victory Fund. The race to unseat GOP Rep. Darrell Issa in California’s redrawn 48th Congressional District features Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar, who describes himself as a \"working-class progressive\" and was endorsed by the Sanders-linked group Our Revolution. Campa-Najjar, who volunteered for Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign and appears to be the front-runner in the Democratic primary, was endorsed in 2020 by the Working Families Party as well as Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Courage to Change PAC. CHARLIE KIRK'S WARNINGS ABOUT SOCIALISM RESURFACE AS MAMDANI, TRUMP FOCUS ON AFFORDABILITY GOP Rep. Tom Barrett is up for re-election in Michigan’s 7th Congressional District, and one of the Democrats running to replace him is William Lawrence, who co-founded the progressive Sunrise Movement. Lawrence’s policies have drawn comparisons to Mamdani, including from the Lansing City Pulse, who wrote that his \"campaign is built on a community movement, a message of ‘real representation’ that takes ‘political control away from the establishment and puts it back in the hands of the people.’ It’s like how Zohran Mamdani won in New York City.\" Peter Chatzky is running as a Democrat challenging GOP Rep. Mike Lawler in New York’s 17th Congressional District, and although he is running in a crowded primary, he has the ability to self-fund and is viewed as a formidable contender in a district ranked by Cook Political Report as \"Lean Republican.\" Chatzky has defended Mamdani’s agenda on social media and praised the young socialist for running \"an effective campaign that consistently focused on affordability, fairness, and opportunity in New York City.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Chatzky, the only Democrat in the field who has called for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to step down, has expressed support for \"universal healthcare.\" Like Mamdani, Chatzky has also faced criticism for his positions on Israel and defended Mamdani against allegations of antisemitism. In Nebraska, John Cavanaugh, a state senator, is running as a Democrat to replace retiring GOP Rep. Don Bacon in the 2nd Congressional District with the endorsement of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which he said he is \"grateful\" for and that he plans to join them on the \"front lines.\" As Democratic leadership in Washington, D.C. begins to face calls for new faces, Republicans across the country have made the argument that the socialist push in recent months is reshaping key House races and changing the landscape of the way the Democratic Party operates going forward. Mike Marinella, national spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), told Fox News Digital the rise of progressive candidates is a \"full-blown battle for the soul of the Democrat Party\" and concluded that the \"socialist stampede is winning.\" \"Democrats aren’t focused on helping working families, they’re too busy tearing each other apart.\" In a statement to Fox News Digital, DCCC spokesperson Viet Shelton touted the Democrats across the country who are focusing on affordability. \"Because of House Republicans, everything is too damn expensive and working families are struggling. Republican operatives in D.C. know they can’t win on the issues, so we’re seeing them melt down in real time,\" Shelton said. \"Even President Trump is in the Oval Office desperately bear hugging the Mayor-elect. It’s embarrassing. While they waste their time, Democrats across the country are laser focused on lowering prices and fighting for everyday Americans, which is why we will re-take the majority.\"",

        "text": "Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., said she disagreed with President Donald Trump on Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and doubled down on calling him a \"jihadist\" during an interview on Monday. News 12 senior political reporter Tara Rosenblum asked Stefanik to respond to Trump disagreeing with her characterization of Mamdani. \"I strongly believe that Zohran Mamdani is catastrophic for the people of New York City and really for the people of New York State, particularly when you consider the fact that New York City and the greater New York City region is home to more Jewish families than any other part of the world outside of Israel. And yet it is increasingly dangerous. We’ve seen a skyrocketing of antisemitism,\" Stefanik said. \"And you have Zohran Mamdani, who is a defund-the-police, tax-hiking socialist who has campaigned with an unindicted co-conspirator of terrorist attacks, including the 1993 World Trade Center bombing that killed New Yorkers. So I stand by my statement, he is a jihadist, and this is an area where President Trump and I disagree,\" the lawmaker added. STEFANIK WRITING NEW BOOK AMID GUBERNATORIAL RUN BUZZ Stefanik entered New York's gubernatorial contest earlier this month in a challenge to unseat incumbent New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul. The president met with Mamdani on Friday and was asked by a reporter during the press conference that followed the meeting if he thought he was standing next to a jihadist, after noting Stefanik's characterization. \"No, I don’t. But she’s out there campaigning, and you know, you say things sometimes in a campaign. She’s a very capable person.

I met with a man who really wants to see New York be great again.\" Trump told the media on Friday that the two found areas of agreement.

What we have to do, however, is allow those officers to focus on policing. And what I mean by that is that in 2020, the response time for the NYPD was less than 11 minutes.

Last week, he had a big, celebratory dinner for the Saudi prince whose goons dismembered a columnist for The Washington Post. No problem! This: too much.”\n\nClaiming that Trump was smitten by Mamdani, Kimmel contrasted Mamdani with the people in Trump’s everyday orbit, “Mamdani shows up.

        "text": "When Elon Musk called the New York Times “government-funded media” in February after his Department of Government Efficiency identified government media subscriptions, the storied outlet didn’t take the criticism lying down.\n\nThe Times responded on X with a bulleted statement explaining the nature of those subscriptions. After Donald Trump attacked the paper in April for a line in a story that noted how legal experts have called his CBS lawsuit “baseless,” saying the Times should be held liable for its “likely unlawful behavior,” the paper said his comments were the latest in “a long list of legal threats aimed at discouraging or penalizing independent reporting about the administration.”\n\nThe Times’ proactive approach stands in contrast to journalists who traditionally let their work stand on its own, and it underscores the shifting environment of a media business under more scrutiny than ever. While mistakes in the past may have once been relegated to a corrections section, the stakes are now much higher, with the wrong words igniting a social media frenzy, or drawing legal threats from the president. \n\n“Letting the journalism speak for itself is an approach from a bygone era,” Patrick Healy, the Times’ assistant managing editor for trust and standards, told TheWrap. “Our audience is understandably asking really tough questions about why and how we publish what we publish — that’s fair, and I think we want to do a better job of opening up our process and how we work in that regard.”\n\nThat defense of proper journalism is critical at a time when mistakes can have devastating consequences. The BBC’s mangled editing of Trump’s Jan. 6 speech in a 2024 documentary prompted him to threaten a lawsuit for somewhere between “$1 billion to $5 billion.” The Times of London, meanwhile, was embarrassed last month after claiming to quote former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio railing against mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani — only to apologize for mistakenly quoting a different man with the same name. De Blasio later questioned whether the Rupert Murdoch-owned U.K. outlet had “abandoned meaningful journalistic standards and ethics.”\n\nAll news organizations have protocols for assessing the veracity of what they publish, though the administration of standards can range from handling grammatical and style matters to CNN’s “triad” approach, which includes a trio of newsroom editors, lawyers and standard-specific editors who drill into a story before it runs. Though integral to newsrooms, standards can be part of the business, with outlets having different practices and processes, and several declined to discuss their specific approaches.\n\nBut today’s perilous legal environment has forced news organizations to be extra-cautious in buttoning up copy and upholding already high standards, while also being willing to defend their journalism in new ways. Several outlets, including the Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Guardian U.S., opened up with TheWrap about operating in a second Trump era and in an era of declining trust in the mainstream media. \n\nAnd while accuracy is important, Healy said, it’s also about “making really public statements, comments on social media and elsewhere, defending our journalism, explaining our journalism, standing up for our reporters and other journalists when they come under attack.”\n\nThe new battleground\n\nIn September, Trump sued the Times and three of its reporters for $15 billion for libel over a series of stories the paper published about the president, his family and his businesses, mostly in the years before his second term.\n\nHealy reiterated the Times’ position that Trump’s lawsuit against the paper has “no merit,” characterizing it as “an attempt to stifle independent reporting and generate PR attention.” But he said such tactics informed the Times’ public approach to handling attacks on its journalism, recognizing that news organizations are facing greater scrutiny from a public inherently distrustful of the outlets that produce the news.\n\n“We’re just very aware of the pressure campaigns and activists from all sides who want the news media to referee and the Times to bend our standards and change our language in their favor, and President Trump and his administration are a big part of that,” Healy said. \n\nTrump’s camp, however, remains consistent in its attack on media.\n\n“President Trump is committed to continue holding those who traffic in lies, deception and fake news accountable for their reckless and politically motivated efforts to defame him and the MAGA movement,” a spokesperson for the president’s outside legal team told TheWrap.\n\nIn this litigious climate, how a news organization commits to its standards department is of new relevance. After a year of legal turmoil over its editorial policies, CBS News lost its head of standards, Claudia Milne, in October in the wake of Bari Weiss’ appointment as its editor-in-chief. \n\nWeiss has since considered dismantling the network’s standards department for “holding too much power,” according to the Independent, after CBS News axed its race and culture unit during layoffs last month. Both departments questioned CBS News anchor Tony Dokoupil’s handling of an interview with writer Ta-Nehisi Coates over the Israel-Gaza conflict, prompting Weiss to defend him in a Free Press editorial last year.\n\n“She also asked openly, ‘What’s the point of standards?’” a CBS News source told the Independent. (CBS News did not respond to a request for comment on its plans for its standards department.)\n\nHealy wouldn’t discuss Weiss’ management of CBS News’ standards department. But he said the Times has increased its standards desk by roughly 10 editors over the last several years. “The standards desk has grown just as the work has grown commensurate with the newsroom expanding,” Healy said.\n\n“Other news organizations are going to make their choices,” Healy added. “I really can’t pass judgment there, but I know for us, standards are core to what the Times does, and having an organized and robust standards desk of really excellent editors is essential to our journalism.”\n\nThe Guardian U.S. has also been “doubling down” on its commitment to its newsroom standards, deputy editor for news Paul Harris told TheWrap. Harris said the U.K.-based paper’s U.S. edition had already maintained a high bar for accuracy — ”We’re not a casual news organization at the best of times, and we’re super not a casual news organization now” — but the president’s hostility toward the press forces the Guardian to work to prevent those who see it as a “political enemy” from latching onto mistakes.\n\n“There’s obviously no doubt that Trump does see the press as the enemy of the people, and the Guardian, as a proudly progressive news organization, is probably not his favorite,” Harris said. “So we would have high newsroom standards anyway, for ethical reasons, but there is now a very solid, obviously practical reason to have them as well.”\n\nHarris said the paper has “definitely” been conducting more legal reviews of its stories than it did in the past, ensuring it was “more careful” in making sure its work stood up to scrutiny. It is also one of the few outlets that continues to employ a public editor, which it calls its “readers’ editor,” to serve as its internal conduit for its audience to scrutinize the newsroom’s reporting and hold it accountable for mistakes. \n\n“We deal with them all the time,” he said. “Sometimes in ways that, as a head editor, you’re on the wrong end of, but that’s just the way it is and it’s also the way it should be.”\n\nThe Journal’s stories aren’t generally receiving additional legal scrutiny, said Elena Cherney, the paper’s head of standards and ethics, but reporters continue to have access to legal advice in the course of their reporting. She said the paper’s ethos of reporting all sides of a story and getting as much information on the record was its north star, one that dated back to when she first started at the Journal in 2000.\n\n“Even then, many other news organizations didn’t expect the same level of reporting rigor from reporters as the Journal did and still does,” she wrote in an email. “Our standards put a big onus on our journalists to go the extra mile.”\n\nTrump continues to issue threats, suggesting in September that he might sue ABC for airing late night host Jimmy Kimmel, and last week called for the host to be fired. He has yet to file a lawsuit against the BBC, though he signaled it would be soon; a spokesperson for the legal team did not answer questions on the lawsuit’s timing. In its apology to Trump last week over the documentary’s editing, the BBC said it believed there was no basis for a defamation claim.\n\nHarris said his paper would remain undeterred in covering the Trump administration, though he noted that even if news organizations report accurately, they could still face legal action. “If the White House wants to come for you, it will anyway,” he said. “It doesn’t necessarily need you to have got your facts wrong to launch a multibillion-dollar lawsuit.”\n\n“The ultimate goal is to kill reporting”\n\nThere’s a reason Trump isn’t hesitating to file one lawsuit after another: He’s been successful at putting various media outlets on their heels.\n\nThe president in December extracted a $16 million settlement from Disney from his defamation suit last year against ABC and George Stephanopoulos, in which the president took issue with Stephanopoulos’ on-air claim that a jury found Trump liable for “rape” instead of its actual finding of “sexual abuse,” a legal distinction in New York. \n\nTrump likewise got a $16 million settlement in July from CBS-parent Paramount over a lawsuit related to how “60 Minutes” edited a Kamala Harris interview, a move critics saw as the company paving the way for regulatory approval of its merger with Skydance. \n\nThe two settlements, paid toward his impending presidential library, appear to have emboldened Trump in his quest to fight news organizations over unflattering stories, forcing companies to shell out millions and alarming media law experts in the process. \n\nThe ultimate goal is to kill reporting and to kill journalism that is less favorable to him.” – Katie Townsend, former Reporters Committee for Free of the Press deputy executive director\n\n“You’re inflicting pain by engaging in the lawfare, whether or not the outcome is ultimately in your favor,” said Katie Townsend, a Gibson Dunn partner and the former deputy executive director and legal director for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. “Donald Trump is very smart about that. He realizes it would ensure pressure, it’s a way to inflict pain, and the ultimate goal is to kill reporting and to kill journalism that is less favorable to him, that’s more critical to him and his administration and his administration’s policies, and that’s the end game.”\n\nAs The Wall Street Journal in July prepared to publish details of an alleged letter Trump sent to Jeffrey Epstein within a sketch of a woman’s nude body for the financier’s 50th birthday, Trump reportedly told the paper he would sue them “just like I sued everyone else.” A day after the story broke, Trump sued the paper and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, for $10 billion for defamation. (The House Oversight Committee in September released the letter allegedly penned by Trump.) \n\nWhile the Journal wouldn’t comment on the president’s lawsuit, Cherney said it remained undeterred in its coverage of the second Trump era, which has produced a string of scoops. (A Dow Jones spokesperson has previously said the paper has “full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit.”)\n\n“It’s less about having rigid standards and more about upholding our existing high standards, which have always been about maintaining reader trust in the fairness and accuracy of our newsgathering,” Cherney wrote in an email. \n\n“Practices like our commitment to ‘no surprises’ journalism, which means we seek to provide a chance for full and fair comment before we publish a story, stand us in good stead at a moment when journalistic practices are under a microscope.”",

        "text": "Seth Meyers had a good laugh at how “smitten” President Trump appeared to be with NYC mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani this week, but immediately zeroed in on the quiet commentary it offers about the rest of the president’s team.\n\nTo kick off his “A Closer Look” segment on Monday night, the NBC host pulled up an image of Trump smiling broadly at Mamdani, as the latter addressed the press. The president’s delight reminded Meyers of “a 5-year-old meeting Mickey Mouse,” but that was just the tip of the iceberg. Mamdani also charmed Trump into walking back several of his previous insults toward the man.\n\n“I’ve never seen Trump this smitten before,” Meyers marveled. “This is a reminder he doesn’t work with a single cool person. He is surrounded by so many charmless goons that the first time he got to hang out with someone who had a little charisma, he swooned like he was on a date with the varsity quarterback.” \n\n“You’d have stars in your eyes too if you spent every day of your life with joyless gargoyles like Stephen Miller and JD Vance, and then you met a 34-year-old social media star who rapped in a halal cart and once appeared in an actual Disney movie,” he continued.\n\nThe late night host then joked that, before cameras started rolling, Trump probably ran through the list of his team for Mamdani and insulted each one individually. Meyers was also amused by the fact that everyone thought there would be tension between Trump and Mamdani during the meeting, with many pundits predicting fireworks.\n\n“They got fireworks, but they were more like those big old heart-shaped fireworks you see in a rom-com,” Meyers joked.\n\nThe standout quote from the meeting though, at least for Seth, was Trump encouraging Mamdani to just stand by his comments and call the president a fascist.\n\n“That is the flirtiest I’ve ever heard anyone say ‘You can call me a fascist,’” Meyers exclaimed. “‘You can call me a fascist. You can call me any– I’ll be whatever you want me to be!’ I’ve never seen someone so desperate to have another male friend. The nervous smile, the giddy laughter, and look, I’m not judging the man. I’ve been there. Reminds me of when I went day drinking with Paul Rudd.”\n\nYou can watch Seth Meyers’ full “A Closer Look” segment in the video above.",

The two men meeting comes after months of them both openly disapproving of each other. The meeting has proven to be a “political grenade,” according to the source who spoke to Julia Manchester.\n\n“To be honest, I think this pours gasoline on the internal war within the Dems,” the veteran noted. According to the insider, the Oval Office meeting will “further force” Democrats to accept Mamdani and “his agenda.”\n\nJosh Orton, a Democratic strategist, explained how the contempt against the leadership is a first. “I can think of no historical example that would compare to this level of internal caucus fear and dissension,” he noted in an interview with The New York Times.\n\nOrton went on to elaborate how “unique” it is for a whole group of senators to oppose the “leadership’s entire disposition toward politics and the Trump administration.” He labeled the group as “essentially a guerrilla group of senators.”\n\nAccording to a report by The New York Times, the group contains Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen, Tina Smith, and Chris Murphy. Other reports have pointed toward the frustration party members are feeling over the lack of fight that the Democratic leadership is putting up against Trump.\n\n WOW: Democrat Rep. Ro Khanna says Chuck Schumer is an ineffective leader.\nIs Schumer losing his base? pic.twitter.com/34uLTxsnoz\n— House Judiciary GOP (@JudiciaryGOP) October 16, 2025\n\nRo Khanna, a progressive member of the House, also criticized Schumer’s ability to lead after the historic government shutdown. In an interview with Politico, he questioned what the future of the Democratic Party would look like.\n\n“Who is going to be effective? And most Democrats around the country just don’t think that person is Chuck Schumer,” he added.\n\nSchumer’s spokesperson addressed the floating speculation while denying it.

        "text": "When I first heard of Aftyn Behn, the Democratic candidate for Tennessee's special election for Congress in the district that represents Nashville, I just assumed she was your garden-variety leftist who loved to virtue signal to her peers that she is better than the rubes she wanted to represent. \n\nNow I understand that she is much, much worse. She is a smarter version of the Blue-haired radical who secretly fantasizes about upending society by working her way up the ladder, as Zohran Mamdani has in New York City. \n\nBoth are reasonably intelligent, attractive, and profoundly dangerous figures, although Mamdani is by far the better talent. \n\nBehn burst on the national scene because some enterprising opposition researcher dug up her now-famous interview, where she revealed the fact that she hates the people she wants to represent in Congress. That's not an unflattering interpretation of what she implied; she said it outright. \n\n🚨 Aftyn Behn-- the Democrat nominee for the upcoming TN07 special election-- says that she despises Nashville, the city that she's running to represent in Congress:“I hate the city, I hate the bachelorettes, I hate the pedal taverns, I hate country music, I hate all of the… pic.twitter.com/L9lmo1YkkJ— Greg Price (@greg_price11) November 19, 2025\n\nOnce the ball got rolling, people started digging up other, uh, questionable things she said about defunding the police, and she has been unwilling to even walk those statements back so far. She went on the friendliest network possible and still couldn't give a straight answer about her beliefs. \n\nQ. So you don't want to clarify whether you still believe that the police should be defunded?Behn: ...once again, I....don't remember these tweets...Q. What is your position today, hows that, on this issue?Behn: .....once again, I'm here to talk about my race, which is,… https://t.co/5HgNBkCsGW— Mary Margaret Olohan (@MaryMargOlohan) November 24, 2025\n\nQ: Representative, in 2020 you made some tweets that have since been deleted, that were very critical of police. You said, in those since-deleted tweets, that the Metropolitan Police Department in Nashville should be dissolved, another shared on a teacher's union tweet that Defund the Police should be a requirement for schools reopening, and another saying \"Good morning to the 54% of Americans who believe that burning down a police station is justified.\" 2020 was a very fraught year. Do you still stand by those comments, and if not, is there anything you want to clarify?BEHN: Uh – I'm not going to engage in cable-news talking points, but what I will say is our communities need solutions, we need local people deciding, solving local problems with local solutions. And that's not the overreach of a federal government or a state government, of which we are dealing with in Nashville and our cities across the state of Tennessee.\n\nBut these incidents just expose that she is a garden-variety liberal, although farther left than many of them. She is arrogant, but not much more so than your typical urban liberal who looks down on the normies while pretending to care about their well-being.\n\nBut it turns out that she is much worse than that, which makes her emblematic of the radical leftward drift of the Democratic Party. \n\nShe seems nice https://t.co/irl5gDlebf— travis4nh (@travis4nh) November 25, 2025\n\nShe is a sociopath in the Jay Jones mold, which is to say just the kind of candidate that the Democratic Party has gravitated toward in recent years. She was likely chosen because she fit the \"optics\" of the kind of candidate who the party thought they could get past the typical voter in Tennessee. Young, attractive, and smooth enough, and not obviously radical unless you get to see behind the facade that she projects. \n\nBut underneath? A sheer will to power and a willingness to dispose of all the things typical people value in the pursuit of that power. \n\nThe goal is to present an \"I'm just like you, only a bit smarter\" vibe. But the reality is that just under the surface is a desire to rule over others.\n\nBehn turns out not to be as smooth at this game as Mamdani, although I am past predicting that she cannot win. Democrats clearly don't care whether their candidates are sociopaths. They share that same will to power, and there don't seem to be limits to how far they will go to seize power. \n\nBehn is running uphill in this race—this is a district where Republicans typically win quite easily. But you can be sure every Democrat will come out to vote because they hate Trump so much, while an early December special election is much less likely to get Republicans to the polls. \n\nIf Jay Jones can win, perhaps even Behn can too. And if she does, expect Democrats to celebrate, despite the fact that she clearly hates the electorate and has contempt for the very people she is asking to vote for her. \n\nThis is somehow called \"saving democracy.\" \n\nEditor’s Note: Every single day, here at Hot Air, we will stand up and FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT against the radical left and deliver the conservative reporting our readers deserve.

        "text": "What conclusions do you draw from your quick introduction to Summers, which, presumably, you stitched together from YouTube Shorts, Wikipedia, and ChatGPT? More to the point, if you believe yourself to be a rational person who draws inferences based on the evidence in front of you, what should you believe?\nIn the past few months, I have been trying to gauge how much of the American public is now convinced that a cabal of pedophiles runs the world. Polls have shown that a significant majority of the country believes that the government has been hiding information about Epstein’s clients and about his death. But there is a difference between suspecting a coverup and going full Pizzagate-conspiracy mode, drawing connections among Summers, Epstein, Trump, Bill Clinton, Mossad, and the sudden rise of the A.I. industry, which now seems to be propping up a large part of the world economy—and then concluding that some shadowy group of oligarchs rules us all.\nThere are some indicators, however, that Planet Epstein has begun to eclipse our previous home. Congress, for example, voted 427–1 to mandate that the Department of Justice publish “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” linked to its investigation and prosecution of Epstein. That result owed a good deal to Marjorie Taylor Greene, who used to garner national attention primarily as the butt of jokes, but who, prior to her surprise announcement on Friday that she will resign from office in January, had become one of the most visible—and, yes, increasingly respected—politicians in the country. And the fall of powerful figures such as Summers, who escaped scrutiny in the earlier flareups of the Epstein story, suggests that there is a capitulation taking place. Anecdotally, I do not know a single person in my life who truly thinks that this is the end of the story or that every guilty party has been revealed. More crucially, Trump, who can usually count on a third of the country to accept whatever version of the truth he offers, found almost zero audience for his claim of an “Epstein Hoax”—the narrative that continued attention to Epstein is a Democratic plot to embroil his great Administration in scandal and distract from the “greatness” that Republicans are accomplishing. At the very least, elected officials—including those, such as Greene, who have spent the past decade serving as faithful Trump acolytes—have begun to fear the public’s wrath on this issue.\nWhat that insurrectionary energy sought was a single theory of the world, ideally one that did not rely on partisan leanings—or, really, on politics at all. Epstein has provided that. Lest we forget, Epstein died more than six years ago now, and although the story certainly had not been forgotten by the public, it had at least been moved to a low-heat back burner when Greene; Thomas Massie, a U.S. representative from Kentucky; and a handful of other politicians began to talk about the Epstein files again. The ham-fisted response from the Trump Administration certainly didn’t quiet things. The fact that an increasing number of Americans, spurred on by the war in Gaza and by new-media commentators across the political spectrum, were starting to question the influence that Israel had on Washington, D.C., has also played a role.\nA little more than a month ago, I noted that “on Planet Epstein, everything that happens—the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the war in Gaza, the suppression of speech by the Trump Administration—serves as proof that the country is run by blackmail, pedophilia, and fealty to Israel. I do not think very many Americans buy into every part of that story, and I imagine that a great number would be rightfully appalled by the implicit and explicit antisemitism in this view of the world.” In hindsight, I fear that I might have undersold the number of Americans who do believe all those things. I don’t know for sure, of course, as there’s no way to really quantify unrest and suspicion. I also don’t know how, if a good portion of the country now resides on Planet Epstein and wants to upend every American institution, society keeps functioning. What comes next? If you believe that Summers’s extensive appearances in the Epstein files suggest that both Harvard and OpenAI are fundamentally compromised by a child-sex-trafficking ring, and therefore must be burned to the ground, what do you put in their place?\nCould Greene, freed from Congress, and in spite of her past nuttiness and humiliations, become the magnet who pulls together the populist right and the populist left? Probably not. But it wouldn’t surprise me if she ran for President in 2028, possibly as the head of an America First party. (In a statement about her impending resignation, she condemned “the Political Industrial Complex of both Political Parties.”) Nor would it shock me if she chose someone from the insurrectionary left as her running mate. (At a press conference last week about the Epstein files, Greene and Massie were joined by Ro Khanna, the left-wing representative from California, and one of the most visible co-sponsors of the recent Epstein bill.) Such a campaign would certainly feature a lot of talk about Epstein and Israel, and would likely call for a new vision of the country that did away with what Greene called traitors who serve “foreign countries and themselves.” How would such a ticket fare against, say, a standard Democratic ticket anchored by a familiar face like Pete Buttigieg or Gavin Newsom? How would this horseshoe campaign do against J. D. Vance? Maybe not so well; political inertia and the two-party system are still powerful forces, despite the Epstein revolution that’s taking place on every smartphone in the country.\nBut, in the next few years, more politicians will emerge who adopt the crucial positions of this coalition: foreign-policy isolationism and economic populism. Even Zohran Mamdani, who famously said in a mayoral debate that he would not visit Israel because he would be working on New York’s problems—and who pulled off his own unexpected feat on Friday, by charming the President in the Oval Office—adhered, in his campaign, to a version of these tenets. What this suggests is that political life after Trump will be defined by odd ideological pairings that do not follow the political lines of the past twenty years. An abrupt realignment now feels more probable than endless polarization. (Although it’s hard to imagine a political horseshoe that would bend equally toward left and right. More likely, this one will bend toward nativism with lip service paid to widening the public’s social safety net.) Some of the surprises that result from this realignment, such as Mamdani’s unlikely victory, will surely cause both hope and fear, as people grapple with the unexpected. But I do not think that we can fully predict the alliances to come, nor the new order they will bring. ♦",

They always accept these claims when it's Trump. Slotkin threw in the Nuremberg trials, and the movie A Few Good Men instead of any evidence.\n\nJorge noted that while the video may not meet a legal definition of “sedition”, it most certainly meets the elements of 18 USC §2387, which proscribes \"attempts to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty\" by military personnel.\n\nThe whole story as it unfolded suggests that the video was meant to cause a fierce reaction from Trump -- which would explain why the media didn't touch it until Trump reacted.

        "text": "There was no ring on the ring finger of second lady Usha Vance when she visited Camp Lejeune, a military base, alongside first lady Melania Trump earlier this week.\n\nThe duo was photographed on Nov. 19 walking together in North Carolina. And the second lady – the wife of Vice President JD Vance – was seen without her wedding ring, talking to the troops and to the first lady. Despite the online discourse, Vance has been pictured with and without her wedding band on numerous occasions.\n\nBy the time Friday, Nov. 21, rolled around, the split rumors surfaced on social media. Speculation about the state of the second couple's marriage intensified. But Vance, 39, is the first second lady of her kind, a reserved and hesitant public figure, more focused on motherhood than statesmanship.\n\nA spokeswoman for the second lady told USA TODAY in a statement Nov. 21 that Vance is \"a mother of three young children, who does a lot of dishes, gives lots of baths, and forgets her ring sometimes.\" The Vances have three children: Ewan, 8, Vivek, 5, and Mirabel, 3.\n\nOnce viewed simply through the lens of their vows, Vance is among a growing bipartisan group of modern women in America who are bucking the constructs and constraints of political marriages.\n\nWho is Usha Vance? Here's what to know about the incoming second lady\n\nJennifer Siebel Newsom, wife of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, reimagined her role as \"first partner,\" ditching the \"lady\" label due to gendered stereotypes. Michelle Obama has been outspoken during President Donald Trump's second term about the burden of being first lady. Rama Duwaji, married to New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, is an accomplished illustrator who never speaks to the press, offering statements through her artwork on Instagram.\n\nLike Melania Trump, she rarely sits for interviews. Besides an hourlong appearance on Meghan McCain's podcast, sitting as the former \"View\" cohost announced her third pregnancy, Vance has skipped press stops since her husband took office.\n\n\"Interesting. Usha Vance minus wedding ring yesterday at Camp Lejeune,\" Democratic strategist Adam Parkhomenko said on X, incorrectly stating the day of Vance's visit. \"Is JD sleeping on the couch?\" the Democratic Party's official X account said.\n\nUsha Vance skips wearing wedding ring. Why do we care?\n\nBorn and raised in San Diego, Usha Chilukuri was a child of Hindu Indian immigrants and both of her parents are educators.\n\nThe Vances met as students at Yale Law School, where she excelled. \"She seemed some sort of genetic anomaly, a combination of every positive quality a human being should have: bright, hardworking, tall, and beautiful,\" her husband wrote in his 2016 memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" calling the second lady his \"spirit guide.\"\n\nBefore President Trump picked her husband as his running mate, Vance was a lawyer at Munger, Tolles & Olson, a firm that specializes in litigation and corporate law. After Trump won the 2024 presidential election, Vance moved her family from their home in Cincinnati's East Walnut Hills neighborhood to the United States Naval Observatory, the traditional residence of the vice president's family.\n\nDuring her time as second lady, Vance has still been the subject of rumors about the health of her marriage. Kennedy heir Jack Schlossberg, now running for Congress, garnered backlash after joking that he was expecting a baby with Vance.\n\nThe internet ignited in furor after Charlie Kirk's widow, Erika, hugged her husband. Vice President Vance made headlines last month for saying he hoped his wife would convert to Catholicism.\n\n\"Do I hope eventually that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved in by church? Yeah, I honestly, I do wish that, because I believe in the Christian gospel, and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way,\" JD Vance said, speaking at a Turning Point USA event at the University of Mississippi on Oct. 29.\n\n\"But if she doesn't, then God says, 'Everybody has free will,' and so that doesn't cause a problem for me. That's something you work out with your friends, with your family, with the person that you love,\" he added.\n\nThen, of course, the missing ring.\n\nThere are countless reasons why somebody may choose not to wear their wedding band. They took it off to be cleaned. It felt too tight. They left it on the bathroom counter before going to bed that night. In the movies, the wife slips off her wedding ring after an argument or fight. In real life, many people just forget.\n\nVance is busy doing the dishes and giving the kids baths. In America, it could also just be that the second lady's ring and narrative belong to her first.\n\nContributing: Amaris Encinas, Aysha Bagchi",

This is a reminder: He doesn’t work with a single cool person!” Meyers said while showing an image of several Trump officials, including White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Vice President JD Vance. “He is surrounded by so many charmless goons that the first time he got to hang out with someone that had a little charisma, he swooned like he was on a date with the varsity quarterback.”\n\n“You’d have stars in your eyes, too, if you spent every day of your life with joyless gargoyles like Stephen Miller and JD Vance, and then you met a 34-year-old social media star who rapped in a halal cart and once appeared in an actual Disney movie,” he added.\n\nMoments later, Meyers played a clip of Trump interrupting Mamdani after a reporter asked the Democratic socialist about describing the president as a fascist.\n\n“That’s OK, you can just say ‘Yes,’ OK? It’s easier — it’s easier than explaining it, I don’t mind,” Trump said before patting Mamdani on the arm.\n\n“That is the flirtiest I’ve ever heard anyone say, ‘You can call me a fascist,’” Meyers quipped.\n\nHe then launched into his Trump impression: “You can call me a fascist, you can call me — I’ll be whatever you want me to be!”\n\nWatch more of Meyers’ Monday monologue on “Late Night.”",

        "text": "Comedian Louis C.K. has found love with Philip Seymour Hoffman's widow — 11 years after the Hunger Games star died of a heroin overdose.\n\nRadarOnline.com can reveal the funnyman, 58, was spotted kissing Mimi O’Donnell, 55, during a romantic stroll in New York City.Shock New RomanceO'Donnell, Spotify's head of scripted fiction, shared a 15-year relationship and three children with Hoffman, the Hollywood actor who died in 2014 at 46 after a devastating drug relapse.\n\nIt's her first romance since her longterm partner's tragic death.\n\nC.K. was infamously \"canceled\" after admitting to multiple sexual misconduct allegations in 2017. \n\nHe was previously married to Alix Bailey and has two daughters. \n\nThe controversial comedian has also been linked to Fiona Apple, Sarah Silverman, Blanche Gardin, and Dasha Nekrasova.\n\nHe became one of the first high-profile figures swept up in the #MeToo movement in 2017, when five women accused him of exposing himself and masturbating in front of them in nonconsensual and often bizarre circumstances.Rebuilding CareerHe admitted the allegations were correct, saying: \"These stories are true,\" and apologized. \n\nHollywood quickly cut ties, pulling him from projects and replacing him in roles that had already been filmed.\n\nSome comedians, including Chris Rock and Silverman, defended his right to return to the stage. \n\nOthers, including Judd Apatow and Rose Byrne, said it was too soon. \n\nHe's been steadily rebuilding his stand-up career since making a comeback in 2019.\n\nThe comic has a string of sold-out shows for his current Ridiculous tour with two shows at New York's Beacon Theatre this week.Overdose TragedyO'Donnell, who lives in a multimillion-dollar West Village home, recently made headlines as an early supporter of New York City's new Democratic Socialist mayor Zohran Mamdani. \n\nThe father of O'Donnell's three children, Hoffman, died of an accidental drug overdose in his Manhattan apartment in February 2014, at the age of 46.\n\nHoffman's struggle with addiction stretched back to his early 20s, though few in Hollywood ever knew the full story. \n\nThe actor quietly got sober after graduating from NYU's drama school in 1989 and stayed clean for more than 20 years, keeping his past heroin use so private that even close colleagues were unaware of the severity of his early battles.\n\nBut he secretly relapsed in 2012, beginning with prescription opioids before sliding back into heroin.Friends later said his habit escalated at alarming speed, with the Oscar winner allegedly spending up to $10,000 a month on drugs in the year before his death. \n\nHoffman even checked himself into a detox facility for just ten days in May 2013, a short stay that those close to him saw as a worrying sign he wasn't confronting the relapse.\n\nO’Donnell separated from Hoffman months before his death because he wasn't addressing his drug use, though the two continued co-parenting their three children.\n\nShe later described watching the relapse as \"like witnessing a drowning in slow motion,\" saying she hoped the distance would force him to seek help.",

It assists immigration to Israel. It is a recognized nonprofit organization.\n\nIt seems that, since Mamdani thinks Israel is illegitimate as a Jewish state, he therefore also believes furthering Jewish immigration is an illegal activity.\n\nHis distain of Israel and Jews is open and obvious.\n\nMark Seitelman\n\nThe violent attack on the Park East Synagogue was just a prelude to what’s to come when the openly antisemitic, anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian and pro-BDS Mamdani and his Democratic Party, led by far-left radicals, takes office.\n\nMax Wisotsky\n\nHighland Park, NJ\n\nMamdani doesn’t seem to understand the central story of the Bible is for Jews to return to the actual Holy Land and efforts to do so are not in violation of international law.\n\nIs it even appropriate for a mayor-elect, a Muslim at that, to deny the understanding of another person’s religion in Amer-ica?\n\nAlan Hoffman\n\nEast Windsor, NJ\n\nThis was not an act of free speech or protest.\n\nThis was a test to see what these terrorists could get away with. Next time, it will be worse.\n\nWe need better laws against holding hate rallies outside houses of worship.\n\nCarol Meltzer\n\nMamdani should know that if Jews violate international law by moving or intending to move to Israel, we’ve been doing so for a long time.\n\nThe Amidah, the centerpiece prayer recited by Jews of all denominations, calls on God to “bring us together from the four corners of the Earth into our Land.”​\n\nBy his token, we Jews violate international law every time we open a siddur and have been doing so for almost two millennia.\n\nJeff Elikan\n\nSilver Spring, Md.\n\nNo one should be surprised by this hate-filled protest. The Muslim Brotherhood is here, planning to “transform Western society from within.”\n\nFrom the disruption of college campuses to the normalization of antisemitism, they are on a roll.\n\nRobert Mangi\n\nGarden City\n\nThe Issue: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) announcing her resignation from Congress.\n\nAs a die-hard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene voter, I think she should retract her resignation immediately (“Shocker! MTG quits Congress,” Nov. 22).\n\nShe used her time in office to torch waste, expose bureaucratic nonsense and say what every fed-up American was thinking.\n\nShe subjected witnesses like Dr. Anthony Fauci, Kimberly Cheatle and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew to withering cross-examinations.\n\nIn 1982, William Safire asked, “Who speaks for the average man?” Today the answer is MTG.\n\nAndrew Delaney\n\nI have come to see MTG as an eccentric trouble-maker over the past five years.\n\nI think her resignation has a lot to do with the fact that President Trump and her congressional colleagues are fed up with her.\n\nShe feels betrayed, and it hurts so much that she can no longer focus on her job, but that’s not on Trump or her party; that’s on her.\n\nIt’s one thing to take your job too seriously, but I think her mistake was taking it too personally.\n\nGood luck to her wherever she goes from here.\n\nArthur Saginian\n\nSanta Clarita, Calif.\n\nWant to weigh in on today’s stories?

        "text": "Michelle Obama has once again captured global attention after sharing fresh behind-the-scenes images from a recent photo shoot. The former first lady's slimmer silhouette and refreshed styling prompted a wave of online reactions, with some social media users speculating about weight loss drugs such as Ozempic. Those claims, however, are unproven and, as many experts caution, unnecessary. Obama has never stated she is taking any medication for weight loss, and commentators warn that sudden online debate about a woman's appearance can be misleading and harmful.\n\nWhy People Reacted Negatively to Michelle Obama\n\nThe photographs in question were taken as part of an update to Annie Leibovitz's celebrated Women portrait series and shared widely across social platforms. In the new shots, Michelle Obama wears relaxed, contemporary clothing and appears leaner than in some earlier public appearances. The pictures were styled for a specific editorial look, which means lighting, angles, retouching and wardrobe all played a major role in how she appeared. Reports that covered the shoot pointed out that the pictures were part of a controlled shoot rather than casual snapshots.\n\nPeople on social media were quick to draw conclusions. With public interest in GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy at an all-time high, many attribute any visible weight change to medication rather than to normal life factors.\n\nCelebrities across the board have faced similar allegations, which sometimes result from new hairstyles, changes in fitness routines, different diets, or simply different photographic contexts. The presence of rumour does not equal proof, and Obama's own social media shows that she is living a happy and fulfilling life.\n\nREAD MORE: Is Donald Trump Copying Zohran Mamdani? Internet Explodes Over His New Look\n\nWhy the Ozempic Angle is Misleading\n\nThe viral claim that Michelle Obama is on Ozempic has no factual basis beyond unverified online speculation. As of this writing, there is no statement from Obama or her representatives confirming the use of GLP-1 drugs. All publications reporting on the new pictures noted that such claims remain unverified. Public figures also retain the right to privacy about medical matters and should not be the subject of casual diagnosis on social media.\n\nMedical experts and photo professionals highlight many harmless reasons why a person might look different from one image to the next. Ageing, natural hormonal changes such as menopause, adjustments to diet and exercise, hydration levels and temporary fluctuations in body composition can all change the way someone appears. Professional photographers also use composition, lens choice, retouching and lighting to create a particular mood or aesthetic. Any one of those factors could explain the change without invoking medication.\n\nThe Cultural Cost of Speculation\n\nThere is a real cultural cost to turning every change in a woman's appearance into a conspiracy. When public reaction leaps straight to prescription drugs, it overlooks the full humanity of the person photographed.\n\nMichelle Obama has long been vocal about healthy living and body confidence, and she has faced intrusive commentary before. Spreading unfounded claims risks normalising a culture that imagines medical interventions where none have been proven. Fact checking and thoughtful reporting matter as social media reactions are rarely reliable. Currently, Michelle Obama appears to enjoy a strong family and social life, alongside running other ventures including her podcast and public outreach projects.\n\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK",

        "text": "Socialism has failed every time it has been tried because it is impossible for a group of people to implement a centralized governing apparatus capable of effectively organizing society. \n\nHeretofore, most people have resented and rejected the yoke of socialism, sometimes after long struggles, because collectivism is also antithetical to individual autonomy, free will, human nature, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nThis is not the case in the United States. Today, more than 30 years after the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, young Americans want socialism. \n\nAccording to new polling conducted by Rasmussen Reports and The Heartland Institute, which included 1,496 likely voters aged 18 to 39, more than half of young Americans want a democratic socialist to win the White House in 2028.\n\nLikewise, more than half of those polled have a favorable impression of New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, and nearly 60 percent support socialist policies like a nationwide rent freeze and government-run grocery stores in every town.\n\nSEE ALSO: Mamdani Wants Gov't-Run Grocery Stores in NYC. Here's How Well That's 'Working' in Kansas City.\n\nThere are many reasons why socialism appeals to young Americans. \n\nFirst and foremost, young people are not being taught about the dark history of socialism. Second, they are misled into believing that socialism is superior to free-market capitalism. Third, they are brainwashed into believing that collectivism is more righteous, fair, and just than personal freedom. Fourth, they feel that the American dream is dead and socialism is the solution to the cost-of-living crisis they face.\n\nNearly three-in-four young likely voters think the cost of housing is at a crisis level, and only 22 percent think they will be better off than their parents. \n\nAt this point in time, given the economic headwinds they face, coupled with their ignorance of socialism, it makes sense that an alarming portion of young Americans want socialism.\n\nRELATED: Magic Fairies and Pixie Dust: Listen to What Mamdani Says About Funding for 'Free' Buses in NYC\n\nEven more concerning, many young Americans also want to give an advanced AI system the authority to control the majority of public policy decisions. More than 40 percent of young likely voters are okay with letting AI, not human beings, determine the laws, rules, and regulations that govern society. More than a third think AI should revise the Constitution, be granted to authority to determine individual rights, and run the world’s largest militaries.\n\nThe reality that almost half of young Americans want AI to govern society, combined with the fact that more than half also want socialism, makes for a dangerous proposition.\n\nWhat if AI could make socialism feasible? What if AI and quantum computing could organize enormous amounts of data in real time and develop an efficient centralized system that could monitor and control everything? \n\nTheoretically, an AI-based socialist system could do a far better job than human-led bureaucracies when it comes to redistributing wealth, calculating and distributing resources, monitoring the population, etc.\n\nModern, AI-infused socialism could be billed as incorruptible, all-knowing, and most importantly, effective.\n\nUnlike the vast centralized bureaucracies that utterly failed to micromanage economies, an AI-driven command-and-control economy could use ruthless efficiency to guarantee equal outcomes.\n\nOf course, an AI-generated socialist utopia, in which Marx’s dream of “From each according to their ability, to each according to their need” is finally realized, could turn into a dystopian nightmare.\n\nBefore this happens, I hope young people realize that socialism is the problem, not the solution. Even more importantly, I hope they understand that liberty, free will, and individual autonomy are blessings that ought to be protected from any encroachment, whether from humans or machines.\n\nChris Talgo (ctalgo@heartland.org) is editorial director at The Heartland Institute.\n\nEditor's Note: President Trump is leading America into the \"Golden Age\" as Democrats try desperately to stop it. \n\nHelp us continue to report on President Trump's successes.

        "text": "Slick article\n\nI thank the Miami Herald for publishing the Nov. 20 article concerning the opening of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico to oil drilling and the after-effects of this action. Articles like these are crucial in protecting Florida’s extremely unique environments and thereby protecting the massive tourist industry alongside it.\n\nExpressing Florida residents’ concerns as a result of the previous oil spill is crucial in reflecting people’s views and stating how elected officials are representing their districts is an amazing example of the power of democracy. The article emphasizes the people’s views and the power of democracy at its finest.\n\nFrederick Landsea,\n\nPalmetto Bay\n\nCode of ethics\n\nPresident Trump’s latest rant about the congressmen who told military members they don’t have to follow illegal orders shows that Trump is ignorant or is trying to win the public relations contest by misrepresenting what they said. They stated what is in the U.S. military code: that service members have a duty to refuse orders that require the commission of a crime, violate the Constitution, federal law or clear international law obligations.\n\nFurthermore, if the military or its members commit a crime, they can be prosecuted by article 92 in the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Unlike Trump, they don’t have immunity and following orders is not a get out of jail card.\n\nThis might have been a factor in Admiral Alvin Holsey’s unexpected early retirement from Southcom, as the legality of the strikes in the Caribbean is extremely dubious and may come back to jeopardize military personnel who did them.\n\nTrump probably doesn’t understand that the military swore an oath to follow the Constitution, not the commander-in-chief’s orders if they are unconstitutional or unlawful.\n\nJose Teijeiro,\n\nWho would have thought it would come to this?\n\nGeorgia U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is now the voice of reason in the Republican Party. And for that, she is called a traitor and getting death threats. Unbelievable.\n\nNorman Segall,\n\nCoral Gables\n\nHighest hypocrisy\n\nIsn’t it rich and at the same time pathetic to hear Donald Trump threaten some elected members of Congress with “death” because they encouraged active military members to refuse to obey an illegal order?\n\nTrump justifies this as seditious behavior.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, Trump’s conduct and speech invited a mob of his MAGA followers to rebel against the authority of the U.S. Congress and the Constitution. That is seditious behavior. Trump was impeached. He also should have been convicted and imprisoned for his role in the events of Jan. 6.\n\nHe says he wants death. If so, for whom?\n\nDavid Kahn,\n\nPoints to consider\n\nRe: the Nov. 20 op-ed, “Does Trump have a tipping point?” I smiled as I read John M. Crisp’s theoretical proposition. It affirms everything I have told friends and family alike about the president. From past history to current events, Trump has been untouchable, getting away with everything he has wanted to do — with the unwavering assistance of his MAGA supporters.\n\nThere is no tipping point when your base is a political cult led by a charismatic person who orders the beliefs, behaviors and customs of all members. The cult’s characteristics convey authoritarian control, extreme beliefs, isolation from society and veneration of a single individual.\n\nTrump’s supporters are too deeply invested in him to conclude they were wrong. Doing so would tacitly be admitting they were duped, conned and lacked the wisdom to know any better. That embarrassing conclusion would prevent any MAGA supporter from reaching the tipping point.\n\nEdward Blanco,\n\nReducing exposure\n\nFor decades, PFAS (per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances), have been a class of synthetic chemicals used in products such as nonstick cookware, firefighting foam, stain-resistant fabrics and food packaging. Dubbed “forever chemicals” because they don’t break down easily in the environment, PFAS can accumulate in soil, water, even in the human body. Long-term exposure has been linked to liver damage, suppression of the immune system, thyroid disease and various cancers.\n\nPFAS have been detected in rainwater and some public water sources across Miami-Dade County, though testing shows levels remain below federal and state safety limits. Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department regularly monitors the contaminants. Residents concerned about exposure are encouraged to use certified water filters or have their tap water tested.\n\nElsewhere in Florida, PFAS contamination has drawn more urgent attention: elevated levels in groundwater and private wells near military bases, airports and industrial sites have prompted some counties to provide bottled water or install filtration systems. Communities in Pensacola, Orlando and Tampa have all reported PFAS above advisory levels, making this a state-wide problem.\n\nWith federal regulation still evolving, Florida continues to grapple with how to effectively monitor, limit and remediate persistent pollutants.\n\nJonathan Rubin,\n\nTastes change\n\nZohran Mamdani, the mayor-elect of New York City, obviously hit a nerve with most New York City voters. Mary Anne Mancuso’s Nov. 16 op-ed, “Miami GOP is right to sound the alarm on Mamdani,” did not mention how those New Yorkers came to support Mamdani.\n\nWhen members of a society are continually exposed to the greed and avarice of corporations and political cronyism, they begin to feel hopeless. They start thinking about change.\n\nThis has happened in the past and unfortunately, history repeats itself if lessons were not learned the first time. Today, this is especially true for our young people, who face excessive college debt, often lack a decent living wage and starter homes that can cost half a million dollars and up.\n\nMancuso writes that the distinction between communism and democratic socialism doesn’t matter. Apparently, it does. When we talk about wealth in our country, we look at median and average household income. The numbers can become skewed because the top tier includes billionaires and millionaires.\n\nMancuso further warns us that this threat of democratic socialism will bring more government intervention. Where has she been for the past 10 months?\n\nCutting SNAP benefits from children and the elderly, healthcare costs skyrocketing and ICE rounding up immigrants without due process is the epitome of government intervention.\n\nMancuso cautions us to remember history and warns others not to repeat it. That warning might be the only point of agreement she and I have.\n\nKathleen C. Fleischman,\n\nMiami Springs\n\nFloating library\n\nThe Presidential Library, which will be built on Biscayne Boulevard, will be a fitting tribute to Donald Trump and his presidency.\n\nOf course, it will have to be built on stilts, because after a hundred years of rising sea levels, the Atlantic Ocean will be lapping at its foundation and, in the distance, Miami Beach will be just a memory.\n\nJames Gross,\n\nNational Hurricane Center meteorologist,\n\nSouth Miami\n\nFat of the land\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio has issued an initiative that will affect me directly: a ban on obesity. I can understand why a nation would want their citizens as healthy as possible (although having visited the U.S. on several occasions, I didn’t see many salad bars).\n\nA guiding principle in life is that all people are equal, irrelevant of gender, race, religion. Now apparently, not bulk. Many in the world are obese, especially in the U.S., so I might have to cross it off my list.\n\nI would probably also be crossed off the list given that not all of my letters to the editors have praised President Trump, who looks like he is also in the obese category. Dennis Fitzgerald,\n\nMelbourne, Australia\n\nThat’s all folks!\n\nSo, can we now tell any woman, “Shut up, piggy?”\n\nAsking for a friend.\n\nMarcelo Salup,\n\nCoral Gables",

        "text": "Today we discuss Texas, overreaction and the voluminous field of candidates for California governor.\n\nIs there anyone who is not running for governor?\n\nI'm not. And neither are my two cats. At least they weren't as of this morning, when we discussed the race before breakfast.\n\nThat leaves us somewhat short of the 135 candidates who ran in California's 2003 recall gubernatorial election. But not by much.\n\nI count nearly a dozen serious candidates, with possibly more to come. Why so many?\n\nOpportunity.\n\nThis is the most wide-open race for California governor in decades. By comparison, you'd have to go back to at least 1998, when Lt. Gov. Gray Davis surged past a pair of moneybag candidates, Al Checchi and Rep. Jane Harman, in the Democratic primary, then stomped Republican Attorney General Dan Lungren in November to win the general election.\n\nNow, as then, there is no one who even remotely resembles a prohibitive front-runner.\n\nPolling in the governor's race has shown former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter and Chad Bianco, Riverside County's Republican sheriff, narrowly leading the field. But with support for both in the middling 13%-to-21% range, we're not talking about a pair of world-beaters.\n\nLike nature, political ambition abhors a vacuum.\n\nSpeaking of moneybags...\n\nTom Steyer!\n\nAfter making a bundle as a hedge fund manager, the San Francisco billionaire and environmental activist has been panting after public office for years. Running for president didn't work out in 2020, even after Steyer spent more than $345 million on his effort. (That's close to what the Dodgers spent on their 2025 payroll.)\n\nSo now Steyer is running for governor, a move he appeared to telegraph by airing nearly $13 million in self-promotional ads that, oh yes, supported passage of Proposition 50, the Democratic gerrymander initiative.\n\nWhat are his chances?\n\nLongtime readers of this column - both of you! - will know I make no predictions.\n\nBut California voters have never looked favorably upon rich candidates trying to make the leap from political civilian to the governorship or U.S. Senate. In fact, over the last 50-plus years, a gilded gallery of the well-to-do have tried and spectacularly failed.\n\nPerhaps Steyer will display the policy chops or the razzle and dazzle they all lacked. But his launch video certainly didn't shatter any molds. Rather, it presented a stereotypical grab bag of redwood trees, potshots at Sacramento, multicultural images of hard-working-everyday-folk, a promise to fight, a pledge to build more housing and, of course, a dash of profanity because, gosh darn it, nothing says \"unbridled authenticity\" like a political candidate swearing!\n\nMaybe his fellow billionaire, Rick Caruso, will show more creativity and imagination if he gets into the governor's race.\n\nAt least Democrats have been showing signs of life.\n\nIndeed. Dare I say, the party's mood swing from near-suicidal to euphoric has been quite something.\n\nWinning gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia - not by a little, but a lot - and prevailing in down-ballot contests in Pennsylvania and Georgia had a remarkably transformative effect. (Zohran Mamdani's mayoral victory in sky-blue New York City was no big surprise once the democratic socialist prevailed in the primary.)\n\nLiterally overnight, Democrats seized the momentum heading into the 2026 midterm election, while Republicans have begun scrambling to reposition their party and recraft its messaging.\n\nAll that being said, even before their buoyant off-year performance those widespread reports of Democrats' demise were greatly ... well, we'll leave that Mark Twain chestnut alone. As analyst Charlie Cook points out, 2024 was a deeply disappointing year for the party. But it wasn't a disaster.\n\nDemocrats gained two House seats. There was no net change in any of the 11 gubernatorial races and legislative contests across 44 states ended in something close to a wash. The party lost four Senate seats - and control of the chamber - but three of those losses came in the red states of Montana, Ohio and West Virginia.\n\n\"This is not to argue that Democrats had a great night in November 2024, but it certainly wasn't a massacre or a party-wide repudiation,\" Cook wrote in a recent posting. \"If voters had intended to take it out on the party as a whole, the results would have looked quite different.\"\n\nRather than a wholesale takedown of Democrats, the result seemed very much a rejection of President Biden and, by extension, his hasty replacement on the ballot, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWhat does that mean going forth?\n\nIf you're asking whether Democrats will win control of the House or Senate...\n\n...I haven't a clue.\n\nDemocrats need to gain three seats to take control of the House and both history and Trump's sagging approval ratings - especially as pertains to the economy - augur well for their chances. The president's party has lost House seats in 20 of the last 22 midterm elections and, according to Inside Elections, the fewest number of seats that flipped was four.\n\nThat's why I thought Proposition 50, which sets out to all but decapitate California Republicans in Congress, was a bad and unnecessary move, effectively disenfranchising millions of non-Democratic voters.\n\nAn appeals court last week tossed out a Republican gerrymander in Texas, putting Democrats in an even stronger position, though the legal wrangling is far from over. The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the decision, pending review. And still to come is a high court ruling that could gut the Voting Rights Act and yield Republicans a dozen or more House seats nationwide.\n\nSo the fight for control is far from decided.\n\nAs for the Senate, Republicans stand a much better chance of keeping control, given how the seats contested in 2026 are located on largely favorable GOP terrain.\n\nBut until the votes are counted, nobody knows what will happen. That's the thing about elections: they help keep wiseacres like me honest.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025, Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

        "text": "Kellyanne Conway, a former senior counselor to President Donald Trump, said Monday on Fox News that she thinks socialist New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani lost some of his credibility during his Friday meeting with the president.\n\nConway said during an appearance on “The Five” that her former boss got the better of Mamdani during the Oval Office sit-down, which has been widely described as stunningly friendly and civil in spite of the previous animosity between the two New York politicians. The former Trump advisor also said that the president demonstrated during the meeting his “classic” ability to charm people across the political spectrum, which she likened to a “gravitational pull.”\n\n“I think Mamdani would have done better saying ‘no’ to the meeting. He’s reduced some of his credibility among the folks who basically are addled with Trump Derangement Syndrome and essentially look at Trump and say, ‘The more that he enrages me, the less I should engage him,'” Conway said. “And Mamdani did the opposite here.” (RELATED: Everyone ‘Got Played’: Curtis Sliwa Says Americans Were ‘Suckers’ Going Into Trump-Mamdani Meeting)\n\n“This is classic Trump. He’s the charmer here,” the Republican strategist added. “He’s charming this guy who hasn’t even taken office yet, and he’s hoping that this guy will not follow through on some of his radical ideas, hope that he will rethink some of his non-radical ones.”\n\n“And for a movement, Jessica, that talks about ‘No Kings,’ you got Trump sitting there like royalty, and the guy looking like he’s going to go get him a Diet Coke,” Conway said, addressing “The Five” co-host and Democratic strategist Jessica Tarlov, and referencing the president’s favorite beverage. “It looked like the apprentice to the senior partner, no doubt.”\n\n“But this is classic Trump. He did this with Barack Obama and Joe Biden during transition. Same kind of meeting. He congratulated Hillary Clinton when he beat her and said, ‘Wow, she ran a really tough campaign. She’s really tough’. He hopes she’ll help in his presidency. Of course, she did nothing of the sort,” Conway said.\n\nThe Republican strategist said Mamdani could have either more directly confronted or ignored Trump but instead let himself become “cowed” by the president.\n\n“Imagine if Mandami had gone in there and said, ‘Look, I disagree with things you’re doing. Here are the names of the people who have been abducted by ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and deported unfairly. He did nothing like that. He looked totally cowed and charmed to be there,” Conway said. “If you really wanted to make Donald Trump irrelevant and wish him away, you would ignore him.”\n\nShe added that in the decade since Trump announced his run for president in the 2016 election, she has “never encountered” who could “actually ignore” him.\n\n“He [Trump] is a gravitational pull. He is a magnetic field,” Conway said, giving examples of the U.S. president’s recent meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\nThe Republican strategist said she hopes Trump and Mamdani “work together for the good of New York and the good of the country.”\n\nDuring a Sunday interview on “Meet the Press,” Mamdani said he still considers Trump to be a fascist following their meeting, after he was pressed on the topic by NBC News’ Kristen Welker.\n\n“And that’s something that I’ve said in the past. I say it today,” the avowed socialist politician told Welker. “And, I think, what I appreciated about the conversation that I had with the president was that we were not shy about the places of disagreement about the politics that has brought us to the moment.”\n\nDuring the Friday meeting, a reporter asked Mamdani if he stood by past remarks calling the president a “fascist.” As Mamdani seemed about to answer the question, Trump jokingly interjected, “That’s OK, you can just say yes … I don’t mind.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

        "text": "Linville A. M. McDonough is a University of Maine at Farmington student majoring in political science and minoring in creative writing.\n\nFor years, the Democratic National Committee has gotten involved in state races. And for years, this has been viewed as a positive. Support from the DNC has meant more funding for a race and extra help for Democratic candidates. But what happens when candidates are not chosen by those who live in the state? \n\nOutside funding has too much influence in state politics, and now Maine has become involved in the battle of wills over who should represent us and the Democratic Party.\n\nThe party leaders are becoming increasingly out of touch with everyday voters. They fear losing votes, but at the same time, they are blind to what American voters need. Interest has shifted intensely to Maine heading into 2026, with the Senate seat held by Susan Collins being eyed as a potential seat to flip. \n\nIn 2020, the DNC poured money into our state, hoping a Democrat could defeat Susan Collins. Ads were run with statements saying that Susan Collins had lost touch with Maine. \n\nA connection to Collins’ voters has always been her family’s history in Aroostook County. However, many people think that Collins’ time in D.C. has caused her to forget her roots. She has become more easily swayed into supporting bills that ultimately harm Mainers. We need a fresh face with a fresh perspective. That has been clear for years now. \n\nIn 2020, the DNC chose Sara Gideon to run against her, and she gained support from outside organizations. Polls taken at that time showed she had a good chance of winning. However, when the election results were announced, Gideon secured only 42% of the vote. It became clear that she had not been the optimal choice for Maine. Polling had failed to adequately represent working-class and rural Mainers, an unbelievably ridiculous mistake. \n\nIt did not matter what her polices were when it came down to the wire. As a candidate, she was unable to meld with voters in the 2nd Congressional District. Susan Collins’ Mainer roots were valued more than any change Gideon could bring. People felt a lack of connection with someone from Rhode Island, but that was ignored. The DNC had stuck its fingers in the race, but it didn’t understand how Maine works. \n\nWere Maine voters not asked who they wanted to represent them? Did they have enough of a say in the process? I don’t think we did. The Democrats acknowledged the problem, but the DNC has failed to agree on a solution. Will we see a repeat of the same mistakes made in 2020, again in 2026?\n\nGraham Platner announced his run against Susan Collins with much support from both the 1st and 2nd congressional districts and liberal, moderate and conservative voters alike. He’s an oyster farmer, a veteran and a Mainer in all the best ways. His kindness and ability to reach out to people and build bridges has proven to be very successful, as he visits every town hall he can in this time.\n\nPlatner certainly has not been without controversy, but he has approached his past with an honest attitude, which most people appreciate. He has acknowledged and apologized for the offensive things he has said, and has spoken openly about his military service, his PTSD, his depression and the dark times in his life. \n\nWhat should be focused on is his ability to overcome these challenges and learn from his mistakes, but the Democrats in D.C. have started using his past mistakes as leverage against him to support their chosen candidate. \n\nThey will likely spend a similar amount of money on anti-Platner campaigns to Susan Collins’ team. They did it with Zohran Mamdani, and they have even more motivation to get that Senate seat in the hands of someone they believe is best for us, Mainers. Or rather, the party. Whether we like it or not, money can tip the scale in a politician’s favor. It just depends on who has it and what their goals are.\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer and others have convinced Gov. Janet Mills, after months of persuasion and promises of support, to run against Susan Collins. Janet Mills has accomplished many good things for Maine, but she’s 77 and has been in politics for a long time. She has a history that can make her unintentionally biased. \n\nMills would likely not run for a second term due to age. Consistency in who represents our state is important, but I’m not sure the DNC is thinking ahead for Maine’s future. \n\nIt is hard to deny that some of Schumer’s support for Mills is self-motivated. Platner has said he is willing to go against Schumer if he thinks it’s in our best interest. Platner has also spoken out against corruption and has not been shy in saying he sees some of it in the Democratic Party.\n\nThe DNC’s involvement with this race so far is proof of its prejudice toward certain candidates, and it seems an awful lot like abuse of power or even corruption. Regardless of whether it’s money-motivated or not, the Democratic Party has been resistant to new candidates who want to shake things up. There is an unofficial club, and only approved Democrats are allowed to join.\n\nNew York and Mamdani are prime examples. Democrats in D.C. supported Andrew Cuomo despite clear cues from the people of New York City, who wanted Mamdani. Obviously, Platner differs from Mamdani in many ways, but there are similarities between them. \n\nBoth have been tailored by their generation’s experience growing up, and both have clear goals for the future and are willing to fight for them. And both are being put against DNC-funded candidates who are already entrenched in politics.\n\nIt seems to me, and my generation, that every time we have a candidate who is outspoken and different, the DNC actively works against them. They are suppressing valuable voices, and candidates who inspire young voters and connect with everyday people are being overlooked before they have a chance to prove themselves. \n\nI don’t want Maine to become a victim of the DNC’s meddling and uninformed outside opinions again. Maine voters know what Maine needs, and we need to be left alone to figure it out.",

        "text": "A communist went to the White House Friday. I was working in the Reagan administration when former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev came to the White House in 1987. To be honest, many of us were not happy.\n\nJust as President Reagan was, we were very dubious about the Soviet Union. Reagan had devoted his presidency to bringing “the evil empire” down. Of course, we were also welcoming a head of state for an official visit, and the flag of the Soviet Union was displayed on Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nA lot has happened since then. The Soviet Union is gone, but today’s Marxists are not bred in Moscow. They are bred in the United States, on our university campuses, and make their home in the Democrat Party.\n\nFriday afternoon, President Trump met the mayor-elect of New York City, Zohran Mamdani. There is no doubt that Mamdani is a Marxist Islamist, yet he won 50% of the vote in a three-way race.\n\nBefore the White House meeting, the House of Representatives voted on a resolution to denounce the horrors of socialism. It should have been unanimous, but the vote was 285 to 98. Every Republican present voted for the resolution, but 53% of House Democrats present voted against the resolution. Ponder the implications of that.\n\nBy the way, when I said a communist was coming to the White House, I was quoting the delightful White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. I visit the White House often and I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall at Friday’s meeting, which was described as cordial.\n\nSpeak with reporters after their meeting, President Trump stressed that he and Mamdani have disagreements, but he loves New York City and wants to see it thrive.\n\nNow, one of them believes you do that by punishing success and trying what has failed all over the world. The other believes in spurring economic growth, reducing regulations, and putting more police on the streets. Their meeting Friday may well be the “closest” they will ever be.\n\nSome analysts say that neither man’s base will be satisfied with Friday’s meeting. I can’t speak for Mamdani’s radical supporters, but President Trump has been willing to meet with anyone his entire political career, unlike the “dictator” Democrats and the media portray him to be.\n\nOut-Of-Control Corruption\n\nThe news out of Minnesota lately has not been so “nice.” A 77th defendant was just indicted in Minneapolis for his role in a massive scheme to defraud American taxpayers of $250 million in COVID relief funds.\n\nThe money was supposed to feed children in need during the pandemic. According to federal prosecutors, only 3% of the money actually went to feeding children. Many of the people involved in this scheme are members of the Minneapolis Somali community.\n\nHere’s another outrage.\n\nThe state of Minnesota just shut down a program to help seniors and people with disabilities secure housing. Why would they do that given the current housing affordability crisis? Exploding costs were a big reason.\n\nWhen the program was established in 2020, it was expected to cost around $2.6 million. But the next year, the program spent 8 times more than that. The following year, it spent 16 times more. When the program was shut down last month, it was on track to spend more than $120 million this year.\n\nHow do you go from spending $2.6 million to $120 million? Fraud. Six Somalis were just indicted for stealing money from the program.\n\nFederal prosecutor Joe Thompson said the “vast majority” of this program was pure fraud funneled through “fictitious companies solely created to defraud the system.” Thompson added:\n\n“What we see are schemes stacked upon schemes, draining resources meant for those in need… I have spent my career as a fraud prosecutor, and the depth of the fraud in Minnesota takes my breath away.”\n\nBut that’s not all.\n\nA similar thing happened with the state’s program to assist children with special needs. Medicaid autism claims in Minnesota went from $3 million in 2018 to $400 million in 2023.\n\nDuring that time, the number of autism treatment centers and providers went from 41 to 328—many were newly established centers in the Somali community. When the fraud was finally discovered, the rate of “autism” among Somali children was more than three times the state average—all part of the fraud.\n\nWhat happened to all that money meant to help Americans in need? Much of it was sent to terrorists in Somalia who want to kill Americans. One off-the-record source said, “The largest funder of Al-Shabaab [terrorists] is the Minnesota taxpayer.”\n\nMedia & Political Malfeasance\n\nWhy is this story not major headlines? It is in conservative media sources, but Big Media won’t touch it because it doesn’t serve the cause of the radical globalists.\n\nThe last thing they want you to know is that the corruption of Somalia actually followed the Somalians who came to Minnesota and now live in the part of Minneapolis known as “Little Mogadishu.” (Mogadishu is the capital of Somalia.)\n\nThree key people were either clueless or complicit in this corruption. Either they had no idea, which is impossible to believe given the extent of the fraud, or they just didn’t act because it didn’t serve their purposes.\n\nOne is the man who almost became vice president of the United States—Governor Tim Walz. Another is Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, who now serves as Minnesota’s attorney general. Ellison aggressively goes after conservatives, but not corrupt Somalis. The final individual is Rep. Ilhan Omar.\n\nDonald Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, and Omar deserves a prize for being the world’s greatest ingrate. America rescued her from an African refugee camp. But all she does is trash America, accuse American troops and our allies of war crimes, and stoke radical Islamism. And she is a hero and a role model to young Muslim girls all over America.\n\nTaxpayer money was diverted from needy Americans by Islamists in America and sent to avowed terrorists who want to kill us!\n\nAnd the Democrat leadership of Minnesota and the leftist media don’t care. The only reason we know anything at all is because of investigative journalism by conservative media outlets and appointees of President Trump.\n\nMigration Matters\n\nThe mass migration of Somalians to Minnesota began during Bill Clinton’s administration, when a civil war broke out in Somalia. The migration to the U.S. continued under several administrations.\n\nMinnesota should be a Republican state. It has a similar profile to much of the Midwest—states like Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. We have won all those states, but not Minnesota. It has many working-class people who were left behind by globalism.\n\nBut to win Minnesota, you have to win the greater Minneapolis area, which now has a significant number of Muslim voters. Former Minnesota state senator David Gaither said:\n\n“If you’re a politician, it’s a significant disadvantage for you to alienate the Somali community. If you don’t win the Somali community, you can’t win Minneapolis. And if you don’t win Minneapolis, you can’t win the state. End of story.”\n\nSo, mass immigration from a corrupt nation has put Minnesota firmly in the Democrat column. Moreover, the political influence of the Muslim vote prevented a Jew, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, from being on the 2024 Democrat presidential ticket.\n\n“Diversity” is not our strength—especially when immigrants from cultures that despise Western values refuse to assimilate. This “diversity” will be our destruction.\n\nBy the way, 47 mosques have reportedly opened in Texas in the past two years. One analysis finds there are at least 330 mosques in the state today.\n\nA Real “Both Sides” Problem\n\nSince there is news that the Bush family is plotting a political comeback, here’s a little reminder. After 9/11, George W. Bush wanted to visit a mosque ASAP. Why? To reassure Muslims that we were not at war with Islam.\n\nAt the time, I thought it was a bad joke. Muslims should have been rushing to the White House to reassure Bush that the “religion of peace” was not at war with us!\n\nBut another way Bush tried to reassure Muslims was to import more of them from the Third World—a trend Barack Obama and Joe Biden were all too happy to continue.\n\nThe Uniparty Comes Together\n\nThursday, the Uniparty that has frustrated so many of us for decades gathered in Washington, D.C., for Dick Cheney’s funeral.\n\nWhy would Anthony Fauci get an invitation to Cheney’s funeral? Because he is a creation of Cheney, who wanted Fauci to outsource biological experiments to other countries because it was illegal to do them here. Fauci did his job—sending money to the Wuhan lab!!\n\nWhy was Rachel Maddow there? She called Cheney every name in the book every night on MSDNC while he was vice president. What do they have in common? Only one thing I can think of: they both hate Trump and voted for Harris in the last election.\n\nWhy is James Carville there? The “Ragin Cajun” made his living attacking the Bushes and the Cheneys.\n\nBut they all come together to resist the populist president who wants to help the average American.\n\nLock Them Up!\n\nRemember Antifa, the group that Donald Trump designated as a terrorist organization? Democrats claim the group doesn’t even exist.\n\nWell, five members of the non-existent group were just convicted on terrorism charges for their roles in the July 4th ambush of a Texas immigration detention facility. \n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio has ordered nearly 300 State Department employees who were denied promotions during the Biden administration because of discriminatory “diversity, equity, and inclusion” policies to be compensated and promoted. \n\nA California school district dropped its appeal after losing a lawsuit over its radical gender ideology programs that forced elementary students to read books promoting transgenderism to kindergartners. \n\nFathers in Maine are collecting signatures for a ballot initiative to protect girls’ sports from cheating boys. More men in other states should follow their example to defend their daughters. \n\nLast year, pregnancy resource centers provided over $452 million in medical care, education services, and material goods to women who made the choice of life. Please support your local pregnancy resource center. \n\nDisney dropped references to “diversity, equity, and inclusion” during a recent employee event and from its 2025 business report—a small but notable win.",

        "text": "Renowned comedian Louis C.K. was recently seen sharing a passionate kiss with Mimi O’Donnell, the longtime partner of the late actor Philip Seymour Hoffman. This encounter comes 11 years after Hoffman’s tragic overdose.\n\nThe 58-year-old comedian, who faced widespread backlash after confessing to several sexual misconduct allegations in 2017, has been in the spotlight again. Most recently, he defended his decision to perform at a comedy festival in Saudi Arabia.\n\nDuring a romantic walk in New York City, C.K. and O’Donnell were observed closely embracing, with C.K. tenderly placing his hand on O’Donnell’s head as they paused for several kisses.\n\nO’Donnell, approximately 55, currently serves as the head of scripted fiction at Spotify. She had a 15-year partnership and three children with Hoffman, the acclaimed Capote actor who succumbed to a heroin relapse in 2014 at the age of 46.\n\nThis signifies O’Donnell’s first public relationship since Hoffman’s passing. The Daily Mail reached out to Louis C.K.’s representatives for a statement but has not yet received a response.\n\nIt marks her first public romance since Hoffman’s death. The Daily Mail has contacted representatives for Louis C.K. for comment and has yet to hear back.\n\nO’Donnell declined to comment to the Daily Mail. \n\nC.K., born Louis Alfred Székely, was previously married to Alix Bailey and has two daughters. \n\nHe has also been linked to Fiona Apple, Sarah Silverman, Blanche Gardin, and Dasha Nekrasova.\n\nC.K. became one of the first high-profile figures swept up in the #MeToo movement in 2017, when five women accused him of exposing himself and masturbating in front of them in nonconsensual and often bizarre circumstances. \n\nHe admitted the allegations were true the next day, saying: ‘These stories are true,’ and apologized. \n\nHollywood quickly cut ties, pulling him from projects and replacing him in roles that had already been filmed.\n\nSome comedians, including Chris Rock and Sarah Silverman, defended his right to return to the stage. \n\nOthers, including Judd Apatow and Rose Byrne, said it was too soon. \n\nC.K. launched a comeback in 2019 and has been steadily rebuilding his stand-up career since.\n\nHe has a string of sold-out shows for his current Ridiculous tour with two shows at New York’s Beacon Theatre tomorrow and Wednesday.\n\nHe then heads to California for nine stand-up gigs before ringing in the New year back in Brooklyn at Kings Theatre. \n\nO’Donnell, who lives in a multimillion-dollar West Village home, recently made headlines as an early supporter of New York City’s new Democratic Socialist mayor Zohran Mamdani. \n\nShe appeared in one of his first TV ads in April, jumping up and down beside the then-candidate while holding a campaign sign.\n\n‘I love a progressive candidate. He’s got the energy. I love free child care, free buses,’ she told the New York Post. \n\nThe father of O’Donnell’s three children, Hoffman, died of an accidental drug overdose in his Manhattan apartment in February 2014, at the age of 46.\n\nHoffman’s struggle with addiction stretched back to his early 20s, though few in Hollywood ever knew the full story. \n\nThe actor quietly got sober after graduating from NYU’s drama school in 1989 and stayed clean for more than 20 years, keeping his past heroin use so private that even close colleagues were unaware of the severity of his early battles.\n\nBut he secretly relapsed in 2012, beginning with prescription opioids before sliding back into heroin. \n\nFriends later said his habit escalated at alarming speed, with the Oscar winner allegedly spending up to $10,000 a month on drugs in the year before his death. \n\nHoffman even checked himself into a detox facility for just ten days in May 2013, a short stay that those close to him saw as a worrying sign he wasn’t confronting the relapse.\n\nThe addiction eventually fractured his long-term relationship with O’Donnell. \n\nShe separated from Hoffman months before his death because he wasn’t addressing his drug use, though the two continued co-parenting their three children.\n\nO’Donnell later described watching the relapse as ‘like witnessing a drowning in slow motion,’ saying she hoped the distance would force him to seek help.\n\nThe talented actor who won a Best Actor Oscar for his work in Capote was found dead on the bathroom floor of his $10,000-a-month West Village apartment. \n\nPolice discovered 70 bags of heroin and 20 used needles inside.\n\nHoffman’s drug habit allegedly saw a preferred narcotics were heroin and the prescription drug OxyContin. \n\nFriends said O’Donnell had separated from him in the months leading up to his death as his addiction spiraled. \n\nThey shared three children: son Cooper, now 22, and daughters Tallulah, 18, and Willa, 16. \n\nHe checked into a rehab center for just 10 days in May 2013, but his drug use had escalated before his death.\n\nThe actor won an Academy Award for Capote (2005) and earned further acclaim for Doubt (2008), The Master (2012), and the cult classic, The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999). \n\nHis final completed film, A Most Wanted Man, a spy thriller, was released after his passing in 2014.",

        "text": "A group of liberal senators, dissatisfied with Chuck Schumer’s leadership, has banded together to form a “Fight Club” ahead of the pivotal midterm elections. Their goal is to challenge the party’s continued support for establishment candidates.\n\nThe discontent stems from Schumer’s refusal to back Zohran Mamdani, a fresh face in politics, for New York City mayor, which has stirred frustration among these senators.\n\nThis newly formed group has already started strategizing against Schumer, according to insiders. Their rebellion became apparent following a meeting in the Oval Office, which some insiders describe as a shrewd maneuver by President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump’s unexpectedly cordial meeting with New York City’s mayor-elect last week was much warmer than anticipated, especially given their previous tensions.\n\nA seasoned Republican operative present at the meeting described it as a strategic move, likening it to a political grenade aimed at causing disruption within the Democratic Party.\n\n“Honestly, this could ignite the internal conflict among the Democrats,” the source revealed to Julia Manchester of The Hill. “It might push the Democrats to fully support Mamdani and his platform.”\n\nThe ‘political grenade’ may have already exploded, as the ‘guerrilla group’ is now planning to challenge Schumer during primaries for the 2026 midterms, particularly in Maine, Michigan and Minnesota.\n\n‘I can think of no historical example that would compare to this level of internal caucus fear and dissension,’ Josh Orton, a Democratic strategist, told The New York Times. \n\n‘To be essentially a guerrilla group of senators who are raising concerns not just about one bill or one decision, but questions of leadership’s entire disposition toward politics and the Trump administration, feels unique. \n\nThe liberal group includes longtime progressive faces Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, as well as Chris Van Hollen, Tina Smith and Chris Murphy, the Times reported. \n\nWhile many of them lean closer to Sanders’ brand of democratic socialism, reports suggest they want to the party to put up more of a fight against Trump, even referring to their meetings as ‘Fight Club’ in a reference to the 1999 film. \n\nA spokesperson for Schumer denied any favoritism or complacency with candidates, claiming they only have one goal. \n\n‘Our North Star is winning the Senate majority in 2026 and any decision is made to achieve that goal,’ the rep said.\n\nThe senators aren’t alone in their frustration with Schumer, as progressive members of the House have also been critical in the wake of the shutdown failure. \n\nRo Khanna, a California progressive, told Politico: ‘The question is what is the future of Democratic leadership. Who is going to be effective? And most Democrats around the country just don’t think that person is Chuck Schumer.’\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the most famous members of Congress and someone who many think could challenge Schumer for his Senate seat in 2028, was similarly critical. \n\n‘The Democratic Party cannot last much longer by denying the future, by trying to undercut our young, by trying to undercut a next generation of diverse and upcoming Democrats that the actual electorate and voters support,’ she said. \n\nThe rebel Democrats aren’t the only ones who see Schumer, who has led the party in the Senate since 2017, as weakened following the shutdown.\n\nTrump openly bragged that Republicans ‘broke’ Schumer during brutal negotiations to end the longest government in US history. \n\n‘I think he made a mistake in going too far,’ Trump told Fox News about the standoff in negotiations. ‘He thought he could break the Republicans and the Republicans broke him.’ \n\nThe US Senate voted to end the record-setting government shutdown by a 60-40 tally after a number of Democrats defected. \n\nThe seven Democrats and one Independent who caucused with the GOP were: Dick Durbin of Illinois, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Jacky Rosen of Nevada and Angus King (I) of Maine. \n\nNone of the members have been a part of any of these ‘Fight Club’ meetings with their fellow senators. \n\nAfter weeks of negotiations, the moderate Senate Democrats agreed to reopen the government without a guaranteed extension of health care subsidies, angering many in their caucus who have demanded that Republicans negotiate with them on the Affordable Care Act tax credits that expire January 1. \n\nThune promised a mid-December vote on the subsidies, but there was no guarantee of success. \n\nIn a possible preview, the Senate voted 47-53 along party lines Monday not to extend the subsidies for a year. Majority Republicans allowed the vote as part of a separate deal with Democrats to speed up votes and send the legislation to the House.\n\nThe president said Schumer’s status as a major party broker had withered as the lengthy shutdown dragged his beleaguered party into the abyss. \n\n‘I’ve never seen a politician change so much,’ Trump admitted. ‘He was a pretty talented guy. He’s lost his talent.’\n\nHe accused Schumer of having ‘Trump derangement syndrome’ and said the Democrat Party had been taken over by ‘crazed lunatics.’\n\nProgressive groups MoveOn and Our Revolution have also demanded that Schumer be removed as leader, citing liberal victories in off-year elections in early November showing a willingness for the public to wait out the shutdown.\n\n‘Americans showed a growing surge of support for Democrats who fought back – both at the ballot box last week and peacefully in the streets last month. Inexplicably, some Senate Democrats, under Leader Schumer’s watch, decided to surrender,’ said Katie Bethell, MoveOn’s political action executive director\n\n‘It is time for Senator Schumer to step aside.’\n\nWhile most Democrats have trashed the deal, some liberals have stepped up to back Schumer to continue.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries claimed that ‘the overwhelming majority of Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, have waged a valiant fight over the last seven weeks, defeating the partisan Republican spending bill 14 or 15 different times, week after week after week.’ \n\nWhen asked if Schumer was effective as leader and should keep his job, Jeffries answered: ‘Yes and yes.’ \n\nMSNBC commentator Rachel Maddow also defended Schumer but with faint praise, suggesting that there were no Democrats who could do any better. \n\n‘There’s nobody who is stepping up to take that job right now,’ Maddow admitted.\n\n‘There is no more wasted breath at this particular moment in our governing than the question of Chuck Schumer’s future. He has the vote of every Democratic member of the Senate. He will continue to have that,’ added fellow MSNBC anchor Lawrence O’Donnell. \n\nSchumer, in a speech to the Senate on Monday, said that Democrats succeeded in putting healthcare ‘at the forefront of people’s minds.’\n\n‘The American people will not forget Donald Trump’s cruelty and heartlessness over the past six weeks,’ he added.\n\nJon Cowan, president of the centrist think tank Third Way, said in an interview that the attacks on Schumer coming from the left will likely subside.\n\n‘Every Democrat and allied interest group is going to end their circular firing squad and aim all of their ammunition at Trump’ and at congressional Republicans who are vulnerable to losing their seats in next year’s elections, he said. \n\nSchumer, who has held his seat since 1999, is up for re-election again in 2028.",

        "text": "Top O' the Briefing\n\nHappy Tuesday, dear Kruiser Morning Briefing friends. Selenrecj and the Bouillabaisse Truck will be arriving at 7 AM to offer his wild reimagining of breakfast burritos. \n\nLast Friday, I kicked off the Briefing by asserting that we should just let the Democrats keep tripping all over themselves. I don't sweat politics as much as I used to because the post-Biden Dems are a real Keystone Cops kind of outfit. They have no concept of \"too far,\" especially when it comes to their unhinged hatred of President Trump. \n\nWhile enjoying a little publicity bump after some of the elections earlier this month (which I also didn't sweat), a few Democratic members of Congress decided to step in it by recording a video telling members of the military to ignore orders from President Trump. Trump Derangement Syndrome symptoms have always had a hint of sedition in them, so that was nothing new. It's just the latest proof that the Democrats in the upper echelon of the party are all mentally unwell. \n\nThere's a lot of you-know-what-covering going on right now over the video. As my Townhall colleague Amy Curtis writes, the \"narrative is falling apart at the seams.\" \n\nMichigan Senator Elissa Slotkin in one of the Democrats in the video, and she's struggling in her attempts to put the cat back in the bag. This is from Matt:\n\nAs PJ Media previously reported, Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and a group of Democratic lawmakers recently released a video telling military and intelligence personnel to refuse \"illegal orders\" from President Donald Trump’s administration. They didn’t mention Trump, but the implication was clear.This sparked a fierce backlash, with Trump accusing them of “sedition at the highest level” and saying their actions are punishable by death. The situation quickly escalated into a heated political firestorm with the pearl-clutching we’ve come to expect daily from Democrats every time Trump says or does something.But then Slotkin backed off.On ABC’s This Week, she admitted that she was “not aware” of any illegal orders coming from Trump.\n\nOddly, as Matt notes, ABC's Martha Raddatz kept the heat on Slotkin, and the senator didn't handle it well. I'm focusing on her today because she's a textbook example of how easily Democrats will lie about anything. \n\nI spend a lot of time with family in Ann Arbor and I was back there last year for the two months leading up to the election. The television was on a lot and nobody was muting the incessant campaign ads, so I got to see a lot of Elissa Slotkin's commercials. She pretty much ran as a moderate Republican, which Democrats often do when they're running for office in states that are still a bit purple. Yeah, some people still fall for that. \n\nWhen Slotkin was first sworn into the Senate earlier this year, she was one of the few Democrats who was acknowledging that they struggled last year because the party had gone too far to the left on some issues. She was one of only two Democrats to refrain from voting last March on a bill to ban transgender males from competing in women's sports. True, she didn't vote with the Republicans, but she also didn't join her party when they wanted to make a statement. \n\nThe 2025 Democrats are, as we're all aware, the Borg now. Everyone must be assimilated, and that's why we see Elissa Slotkin tacking hard left these days. She'll probably be hosting drag queen bingo at elementary schools in the new year. \n\nNo matter how sincere a Democrat new to Washington is about not becoming a whacked-out, TDS lefty, it's not going to last. The party has lurched too far to the left now. Even if it course-corrects, what they consider the center right now would have been Fidel Castro Land a decade ago. Zohran Mamdani isn't a drop in the commie bucket for them, he's the beginning of a flood. \n\nElissa Slotkin is falling all over her words now because words are sloppy and have no meaning in the mouths of Democrats. She's merely a perfect example of how far afield they've wandered. \n\nIt's a good thing to remember the next time any Dem in Congress starts squawking about bipartisanship.\n\nContributions to the Mailbag of Magnificence can be sent to [email protected]\n\nClick the button below to get the Morning Briefing emailed to you every weekday.

        "text": "“I have facts. They have opinions.”\n\nThat’s how Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent answered me when I asked him why he seems to have such an easy time dismantling the arguments of establishment media reporters. I shared with him my theory that he is able to calmly embarrass anti-Trump journos because he honed his skills debating Yale students while he was a professor. He didn’t reject my suggestion (he had nothing but kind words for his students), instead offering the aforementioned response. \n\nHe has facts, and they have opinions.\n\nIt’s quite simple, when you put it that way.\n\nWATCH the full interview:\n\nAnd through the first year of the Trump administration, Bessent, the avatar of MAGAnomics has certainly had the facts. He stood up to seemingly everyone in the elite consensus (aside from President Trump himself and the writers of the Breitbart Business Digest) and said that not only can we win trade wars with zero new inflation, but countries will be begging us to cut new deals.\n\nMy colleague John Carney and I got his thoughts on this and more than a dozen other topics in a 45-minute sit-down interview in the historic “Cash Room” at the Treasury Department adjacent to the White House. \n\nThe full interview is today’s episode of The Alex Marlow Show podcast with additional exclusive commentary in today’s Breitbart Business Digest. \n\nThe conversation began with a brief tour of Bessent’s past, where his anti-establishment mindset enabled him to conquer Wall Street (he’s worth more than half-a-billion dollars). “I’ve made money betting against elite consensus,” he said. \n\nHe told us that he specifically modeled his investment career on people who are not only contrarians, but are willing to change their minds. This was quite refreshing in what feels like an increasingly tribal political moment.\n\n“Policy is personnel. And when I saw what President Trump was doing, one of my biggest single trading game days was the 2016 victory,” he said.\n\nHe also identified that Donald Trump was going to become president, twice. \n\n“I thought I would be a good match to be President Trump’s Treasury Secretary,” he told us, “or just to be part of his administration.” \n\n“So, I went to him,” he continued, “almost three years ago now, and said, ‘Sir, I think you’re going to win. I think it’s going to be transformational, and I would like to be part of the economics team.’”\n\nBut Bessent was becoming MAGA many years earlier.\n\nHe described attending a Hillary Clinton fundraiser ahead of the 2016 election because he “wanted to go and sit in the room and hear what they had to say. And I walked out of that meeting, and I said, they’re going to lose.”\n\n“That was the best research money I ever spent,” he added. \n\nHillary Clinton wasn’t the only person he shaded during the event. I asked him to contrast himself with Jeffrey Epstein collaborator and arch-Democrat establishmentarian Larry Summers, to which Bessent said, “You always got to look and see what Larry’s motives are and who’s paying him,” noting that Summers has a “fascination with one of the biggest Chinese propagandists in the world.”\n\nSummers was the president of Harvard, the treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, and director of the National Economic Council under Barack Obama. He also sought seduction advice from Epstein after the convicted sex offender was busted for child sex trafficking. \n\nIn the second half of the interview, we focused on policy and strategy. Bessent detailed how the Trump administration applies maximum pressure to win trade negotiations and how rival nations routinely thank them for the new deal terms. Naturally, he heaped praise on President Trump’s dealmaking acumen.\n\nThe conversation then turned to inflation. The Treasury Secretary walked through “the three ‘i’s that are eviscerating working Americans”: immigration, interest rates, and inflation. He shared that he believed inflation will come down substantially in 2026 and teased a forthcoming study from the Council of Economic Advisers that shows that inflation in red states is 50 or 60 basis points lower than blue states.\n\nA deep discussion of rare earths followed, during which Bessent described the administration’s goal of “de-risking” from China, as opposed to “decoupling.” He touted the fact that rare earth magnets are being made in the United States for the first time in 25 years and that this new industry is likely to generate thousands of new jobs.\n\nBut that’s not the only industry where China’s hold on our supply chain gives him concern.\n\n“We got a problem with pharmaceuticals. We got a problem with semiconductors, steel, ship building. Those are strategic,” he said. “We don’t need to decouple from China. We just have to de-risk. And no one was willing to de risk because it’s hard. It’s not easy, but President Trump has told the pharmaceutical companies, you’re bringing the production here.”\n\nElsewhere in the conversation, the Secretary describes how the national security aspects of his job are amongst the most time-consuming. He also offered advice for Zohran Mamdani (even though “he knows everything”) and explained how the Trump administration views deregulation as the centerpiece of their economic agenda.\n\nThe interview ended on a positive note, with some kind words from the Treasury Secretary: “Congratulations. You both get A’s for your early analysis.”\n\nThe full interview is available now on The Alex Marlow Show feed on YouTube, Apple, Rumble, and Spotify. \n\nLook for more clips and analysis at Breitbart.com and in the Breitbart Business Digest.",

He was then rushed to a local hospital and pronounced deceased.\n\nPhotos from the scene show what appears to be a large pocketknife, blood stains on the pavement, and bloody cloths:\n\nAccording to Pix 11, a motive in the case was unclear. It was the second homicide in that area over the past few days.\n\n“On Sunday, 39-year-old Gibson Winters was fatally shot near West 46th Street and Twelfth Avenue at around 4:15 a.m., cops said. Winters was shot in the back and groin and died at the hospital. There have been no arrests in either case,” the outlet said.\n\nNow, authorities are searching for the three men suspected in the Monday incident. Sources told the Post one was wearing a purple sweater and black ski mask, and another was wearing a black jacket, dark colored pants, and brown boots. The third person was wearing black clothes.\n\nIn May 2024, a man was accused of stabbing a tourist near Times Square and in a separate case, another man was the target of a machete attack in the same area, per Breitbart News.\n\nThe news came as New York City Police Department (NYPD) officers also reportedly endured a 63-percent rise in assaults against them over the past six years.\n\nPrior to winning the New York City mayoral race, socialist Zohran Mamdani seemed to suggest he wanted “mental health experts” to lead in responding to certain crises, Breitbart News reported in October.",

        "text": "Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) expressed that he believes Curtis Sliwa, the Republican candidate in New York City’s mayoral election, cost him “the election.”\n\nDuring an interview on 77 WABC radio station, Cuomo described Sliwa as being “a total fraud for decades.” Cuomo also declared that if Sliwa had not run, he “would’ve won” the election over now-Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani (D).\n\nSpeaking with former New York Gov. David Paterson (D), the two spoke about the NYC mayoral election. Paterson admitted that he had “never heard” of Mamdani’s name until February and questioned how Mamdani was “able to do what he did.”\n\n“I always believed he [Sliwa] would drop out because there was no way for him to win,” Cuomo said. “All he could do is be a spoiler and be responsible for Zohran’s victory. I couldn’t believe that as a Republican, he would … could live with himself and the Republicans could live with him as the person who elected Zohran, which is exactly what happened.”\n\n“If he had dropped out, I would have won, I’m convinced,” Cuomo added. “Because I would have gotten that seven, I would’ve been about a point from Zohran, but it would have changed the whole dynamic.”\n\nCuomo continued to accuse Sliwa of being out there “with the clown show,” spending more time criticizing Cuomo than Mamdani. Referencing how Paterson said the radio station was receiving calls from Sliwa’s relatives, claiming Sliwa had not received equal time, Cuomo pointed out that WABC and radio host Sid Rosenberg “made Sliwa” and “gave him tremendous coverage.”\n\n“Again, talking about election coverage — nobody ever mentioned that Sliwa has been a total fraud for decades,” Cuomo said. “I think Sid Rosenberg was still in Florida when it turned out that the Guardian Angels and Sliwa made up a whole raft of stories of rescues that they did, that turned out not to be true — that Sliwa said he was kidnapped by the New York Police Department and held, and then admitted that wasn’t true.”\n\nCuomo added, “I believe he cost me the election,” and stated that if Sliwa had not run, he would have won the election.\n\nCuomo’s comments come after Mamdani, a democratic socialist, won the city’s mayoral election over his opponents. Breitbart News reported that Mamdani’s win came after “consistent polling” showed him leading in the election.\n\nAccording to CNN, Mamdani received 50.4 percent of the vote, while Cuomo received 41.6 percent of the vote. Sliwa received 7.1 percent of the vote.\n\nPrior to the mayoral election, Sliwa was reported to have melted down during an interview with 77 WABC after he was warned by Rosenberg that he would lose the election.\n\n“So far, you’ve been on this show for eight minutes, and all you’ve talked about is Cuomo,” Rosenberg said at the time to Sliwa. “And, I know you hate him, and I’m going to be honest with you, Curtis — because we’ve been friends for a long time — I don’t feel like you’re running against Mamdani anymore.”",

        "text": "Millennials moved to cities in droves during the 2000s and 2010s, drawn by the restaurants, the nightlife, and the high-paying jobs. Urban planners and local leaders celebrated, embracing what became known as the “creative class” theory — the idea that attracting educated, creative workers would drive cities’ economic growth.\nReal estate developers built accordingly, constructing apartment buildings filled with studios, one-bedrooms, and two-bedrooms designed for singles, roommates, and childless couples. Young professionals could afford the rent, and investors got steady returns. Building larger apartments for families felt risky when the smaller units were working so well. As for single-family homes or townhouses, the types of housing that families with children typically seek out — well, cities weren’t building those either.\n\nKey takeaways:\n- Cities attracted millennials in their 20s but are losing them in their 30s as they start families — and Gen Z, a smaller generation, won’t fill the gap.\n- Families leave cities during their peak earning years in part because there aren’t enough homes that fit their growing needs, which makes cities even less family friendly and hurts the local economy. \n- Demographic decline, economic pressures, and even the real estate industry signal to city leaders that ignoring families is no longer sustainable.\n\nThe strategy worked — until millennials aged out of it. As they now enter their 30s and 40s and start having children, they’re ditching cities where the housing stock never caught up to their changing needs. Across the nation, large urban counties lost roughly 8 percent of their under-5 population between 2020 and 2024, according to data from the Economic Innovation Group. In New York City, families with children under 6 have left at twice the rate of everyone else, a trend that became central to incoming mayor Zohran Mamdani’s winning affordability campaign.\nWhen families leave, cities lose far more than tax revenue; they lose their highest earners, biggest spenders, and the next generation of workers. Because Gen Z is a smaller generation, and the rise of remote work means there’s less pressure for them to live in expensive cities to access high-paying jobs, they aren’t going to fill the gap left by millennial families. \nThe creative class theory wasn’t wholly wrong, but it missed that cities need to retain those people through their peak earning years, which happen to coincide with when they have children. And as baby boomers retire, working parents become even more critical to a city’s economic strength.\nIf cities hope to remain economically healthy, they’ll need to build more housing for families with kids. \nWhy cities haven’t been building for families\nSeveral forces have worked against family-friendly development. Homeowners increasingly tend to be older and past their child-rearing years and often oppose changing zoning laws to allow more housing in their neighborhoods. Worried that the increased density could hurt their property values or quality of life, these more affluent, politically engaged residents tend to wield their outsized influence to keep newcomers out. \nAs a result, American cities are overwhelmingly zoned for single-family housing, leaving little room for the kinds of duplexes, townhouses, and smaller apartment buildings that offer young families an affordable middle ground between cramped apartments and expensive homes.\nThere is also resistance to certain kinds of families moving in. “I’m sorry, but class and race matter in America,” said Mildred Warner, a professor of city and regional planning at Cornell University. Put differently, many cities have used exclusionary zoning over the years to keep out Black and low-income families. \nUpending these historic patterns will require policy changes beyond just fixing zoning codes. Ending parking minimums — which force developers to build a certain number of costly parking spaces per unit — would make it cheaper to construct family-sized apartments. Allowing single-stair buildings up to four stories — rather than requiring two staircases — would free up space for larger, more flexible floor plans better suited to families. Making it easier to approve smaller buildings (those under 50 units) would let developers experiment with different housing types.\nAnother option is to pass laws requiring developers to include more family-sized units, like three- or four-bedroom apartments, though real estate experts warn that such a prescriptive approach could backfire.\nAn alternative idea, proposed by the Institute of Family Studies (IFS) this year, is to change how governments measure the success of their affordable housing programs. Right now, funds that finance apartments at public expense focus on maximizing the number of units built. IFS researchers suggest they should instead prioritize the number of bedrooms and the number of people housed in order to incentivize family-sized apartments. \nA professional culture problem exists, too. Many planners simply don’t consider designing urban communities for families to be part of their job. Michael Huling, a senior county planner in Clark County, Nevada, traces the issue back to dynamics from the 1960s and 1970s, an era when people were flocking en masse to suburbs. Limits on density, rules on how far houses must be from streets, and onerous parking regulations all contributed to a development culture that treated families as a suburban concern, not an urban one.\n“A lot of those anachronistic development patterns and development priorities are still lingering today and we’re still stuck with them,” he told Vox.\nStill, there’s a structural problem that goes deeper than zoning and building codes, or even professional norms. Kids don’t pay taxes, but they do absorb plenty of government services, and cities crave population growth without the associated costs of funding it.\nThe economic reality is harsh and unevenly distributed. Public support for seniors can be up to three times higher than for children, but the federal government provides the vast majority of senior aid while covering less than a third of child subsidies. Instead, state and local governments bear the bulk of K-12 education costs, creating a negative incentive for cities to welcome families with school-age children.\nWarner has found that many politicians restrict family housing, because they don’t want to pay for the schools those children would attend. Because schools are funded largely through local property taxes, cities treat school spending as a direct burden on local budgets while ignoring that businesses benefit enormously from having its future workforce educated nearby. They “ignor[e] the increasing importance of human capital investment as a critical economic development strategy,” she wrote.\nRobert Verbruggen, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, put it bluntly. “Kids don’t pay for themselves while they’re still kids,” he told Vox. “They pay for themselves later when they grow up and get jobs.”\nHis advice for mayors is pragmatic: If you want a thriving city, you need growth and more people paying taxes. Welcome families now and “you have a built-in fan base of the next generation of kids who grew up there and are already familiar with city life.”\nA belated recognition of the consequences\nIn addition to city planners, more elected leaders are beginning to recognize the crisis of housing in their cities. They’re right to, given the compounding challenges their cities face if the crisis continues pushing families to leave. If people in their early-to-mid-30s leave cities right when they’re becoming most productive and experienced in their careers, then they take their mentorship skills and institutional knowledge with them. Cities tend to end up with extremes at both ends: lower-income residents and very wealthy residents in luxury housing, but fewer middle and upper-middle class families.\nOnce families leave, cities are left with fewer vocal advocates pushing for better schools, parks, and transit, making the areas even less attractive to the next generation of parents. And as stressful as more kids in schools might be to finance, in the long run, declining school enrollment (fueled in part by more people leaving cities) and fewer children born mean even fewer taxpayers and less consumer spending. \nIndeed, declining birth rates are another problem. Recent research has found clear links between housing costs, housing size, and birth patterns. Not only is a lack of suitable housing steering families out of cities, it’s contributing to some people choosing not to have kids at all. \nThe Institute for Family Studies found that housing costs limit childbearing goals more than any other factor, including undesired singleness, preference for leisure, schooling, child care costs, and student debt. Housing costs can lead to living with one’s parents for longer, and that has a huge negative effect on fertility.\nAnother study published this month by an economist at the University of Toronto estimated that rising housing costs in the US since 1990 have led to 11 percent fewer children being born and building more two- and three-bedroom apartments could more than double the impact on birth rates compared to building more one-bedroom units. \nIdeas to stem the bleeding\nThese and other changes are forcing the real estate industry to shift. Some institutional buyers — the investors who purchase apartment buildings to operate as rentals — are starting to reject studio and one-bedroom heavy buildings, worried that tenants will keep moving out after short stays, driving up their operating expenses. And construction financing challenges driven by tariffs and high interest rates have created new openness among developers to rethink their more conservative approaches. The “built-to-rent” boom has also demonstrated to investors that families with kids will, in fact, rent homes. \nOne developer is advocating for a range of other solutions. Bobby Fijan is one of the country’s most vocal critics of his industry’s inertia. He started the American Housing Corporation to build family-sized row homes, with the first one set to open in Austin in December. Eventually, Fijan wants to expand into apartments.\nHe’s pushing other ideas, too. In a study published in September, Fijan and IFS senior fellow Lyman Stone surveyed over 6,000 Americans about their housing preferences. When shown apartments of the same square footage but different bedroom configurations, many people preferred layouts with more rooms, even if they don’t currently have children.\nOne model emerged as particularly promising: the one bedroom plus a den. Dens, which often have no windows or closet, are commonly used for an office, a TV room, or nursery. Fifty-seven percent of childless-by-choice people preferred this layout over a standard one-bedroom of the same total size, as did 54 percent of people who say they’d one day want kids. \nFor the real estate industry, the IFS pitch is straightforward. Since developers are already building apartments at 750 to 1,100 square feet, adding one more wall to divide the space could create units that appeal to a broader market. And because families with kids stay in apartments longer than singles, lower turnover could translate to lower operating costs.\nIf cities can keep couples expecting their first child even a half decade or so longer, they might begin to address the problems Warner and others have warned about. More families staying means more of the high earners and high spenders who drive local growth.\nBut Warner is skeptical of the bedroom-plus-den plan, which puts a ceiling on family size. People “like to stay where they are,” she said, and with that arrangement, you’d probably relocate as your family grows. It could accommodate babies and toddlers, but would be less ideal for teenagers who want real bedrooms with doors and windows (and parents of teenagers who’d want that, too). She’d rather see cities build actual two- and three-bedroom units — a return to how cities used to build before developers shifted to smaller apartments. \nFijan and Stone don’t disagree but see their proposal as a way to work within existing constraints. Their hope is that keeping families in cities through their children’s early years could create ongoing political pressure for the deeper changes needed to truly fix the problem.\n\nWill the “abundance” movement embrace families?\nThe growing “abundance” movement argues that removing regulatory barriers to housing and energy — for instance, cutting zoning restrictions and speeding up permitting — is key to economic growth. But making cities family friendly often requires direct government spending on schools, child care, parks, and transit. That’s a harder sell for a movement built around deregulation, not public spending. \nAt the national abundance conference this past fall, Leah Libresco Sargeant, of the Niskanen Center, tried to find a more palatable way to bring her movement on board with new family investments. She argued that the upfront costs of having children prevent families from forming, similar to how high housing costs prevent cities from growing. Baby bonuses and reducing barriers to family-friendly housing, she pointed out, could address both obstacles.\nBobby Fijan welcomes the support from abundance but remains cautious. “I genuinely think that families need to be the goal and not a byproduct” for policymakers, he told Vox.\nFijan believes the abundance movement, which skews younger, may grow into prioritizing families more as its members age. On the political right, he worries that Republican distrust of Democratic-controlled cities could also complicate support for urban family investments. But he remains optimistic, since millions of people want and need to live in cities.\n\nIn the end, housing alone won’t keep families from leaving cities. Cities still need to address public safety concerns, improve schools, and fix basic infrastructure like broken sidewalks and unreliable buses. That will require substantial investments in education, transit, and child care, not just removing regulatory barriers. It will mean challenging homeowners who benefit from the status quo and making spending choices that might not pay off for years.\nThe cities that figure out how to keep their families will thrive. For local leaders watching parents flee and school enrollments drop, these are fights worth having.\nThis story was supported by a grant from Arnold Ventures.

        "text": "Voters want stuff to be cheaper.\nTo most economists, the best way to make things more affordable is to make them more plentiful: When the supply of a good rises, its price tends to fall. Thus, to push down the costs of expensive commodities, the government should make them easier to produce. \nFor example, zoning restrictions make it illegal to build apartment towers in many urban centers. This reduces the supply of housing, which leads to higher rents. Therefore, economists argue that the government should make housing more affordable by legalizing the construction of multifamily buildings.\nBut voters don’t love this answer. After all, it asks them to accept some immediate costs (construction noise, for example) for hypothetical future benefits. More critically, supply-side reforms do little to address their affordability concerns today. When a city council votes to upzone a neighborhood, a dozen condo towers don’t promptly sprout up through the concrete. \nSo, some politicians have recently gravitated towards a simpler solution to high prices: Make prices above a certain threshold illegal.\nIn New York City, mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani campaigned on a promise to “freeze the rent” on rent-stabilized apartments. In New Jersey, the incoming Democratic governor, Mikie Sherrill, vowed to cap electricity rates.\nEconomists consider such price controls counterproductive in most markets because they discourage investment, thereby reducing affordability in the long run. Yet some of the Democratic Party’s leading economic thinkers are warming to them — sort of.\nCan voters have a little bad economic policy, as a treat?\nIn a New York Times op-ed last week, former Biden administration official Bharat Ramamurti and economist Neale Mahoney argue that price controls tend to be economically corrosive, but that Democrats should embrace them, anyway.\nTheir case is primarily political. In their telling, “voters are demanding short-term price relief” and “price controls may be the only viable way to provide it.” Ramamurti and Mahoney acknowledge that price caps have often backfired historically, leading to lower production and less affordability in the long run. But they contend that policymakers can largely avoid these pitfalls by making their price controls temporary. Essentially, they suggest that the government should increase the supply of energy and housing through public investment and regulatory reform — but, while we’re waiting for those new houses and power plants to come online, it should tide consumers over with price controls. \nI think this argument is largely misguided, for four chief reasons:\n* The economic costs of most price controls are quite large.\n* Price controls are rarely the best way to address affordability concerns, even in the short-term.\n* Letting a “temporary” price control expire is politically difficult.\n* Achieving the public’s preferred economic outcomes is more important than echoing its policy intuitions. \nMost price controls take a big toll\nThe case against price controls boils down to one simple claim: When prices move freely, they can make the economy work efficiently, to everyone’s benefit. \nIn competitive markets, rising prices are a symptom, not a disease. They signal that a good has become either more scarce or more desired: If a Labubu factory burns down, then the supply of Labubus available to consumers will shrink. If wearing a menagerie of slightly monstrous stuffed animals somehow becomes fashionable, then demand for Labubus will soar. Either way, a mismatch between how many Labubus people will want — and how many producers can provide — will emerge. If the price of Labubus is allowed to rise and fall freely, then this mismatch will become visible. \nPrice increases therefore surface critical information about supply-and-demand mismatches. And they also give both producers and consumers an incentive to mitigate those incongruities.\nWhen Labubu prices rise, producers earn higher profits, which encourages investors to direct more capital into Labubu production. Over time, that leads to more — and therefore cheaper — Labubus on the market.\nThis same dynamic holds for more vital goods, such as electricity. If a gas plant breaks down, and the power supply in an area suddenly falls, then electricity prices will rise. And that will attract investment toward new power infrastructure — solar panels, gas plants, transmission lines — which will make electricity more plentiful in the long run.\nIn the meantime, elevated prices help consumers ration scarce power efficiently. Rising rates discourage individuals from using power frivolously — such as by leaving the lights on when they’re not home — freeing up electricity for more essential uses. \nPrice controls undermine these mechanisms of economic coordination. When a city caps rents on existing housing units, it discourages investment in new residences. In fact, San Francisco’s 1994 rent control law actually reduced the supply of rental homes in the city, as many landlords converted their units into condos or commercial properties. This ultimately led to higher rents.\nLikewise, price controls can undermine efficient rationing. Gasoline was in short supply in the early 1970s. When gas prices moved freely, this led consumers to economize: People cut back on inessential trips, leaving more gasoline available to commuters. When Richard Nixon put a price cap on gas, however, scarce fuel was allocated more haphazardly. People who showed up to a station at the right time got below-market price gasoline; those who arrived a bit later got no fuel whatsoever, since the pumps had run dry.\nThis is not to say that market prices always produce efficient or socially desirable outcomes. Markets can fail in all sorts of ways. And in some eccentric sectors — where consumers have little choice, sellers have little competition, or the government drives demand — price controls can actually be beneficial. \nHealthcare may be the clearest example. The market for mastectomies isn’t much like the one for Labubus. When the price of a life-saving surgery rises, consumers don’t respond by purchasing a different, lower-cost medical procedure; people are generally willing to pay most any sum to avoid death. And in any case, most people have insurance that will cover at least some of the cost of a medically necessary operation, irrespective of its price.\nFor these reasons, allowing healthcare prices to rise won’t necessarily promote efficiency. Rather, doing so might just transfer income from patients and insurers to doctors, hospitals, and drugmakers. Putting limits on what providers can charge, therefore, makes sense and is common practice in advanced economies.\nFree markets don’t ration scarce resources justly. But neither do price controls.\nThis said, there is a natural objection to rationing scarce consumer goods through market prices: Rich people can afford to pay more for goods and services than poor people can. \nPerhaps, the argument goes, elevated prices will divert electricity from frivolous uses to essential ones. But high rates could just as easily shift kilowatts away from a working-class person’s air conditioning to a billionaire’s private ice rink.\nThis is a legitimate concern. And there are circumstances in which policymakers would be wise to impose non-market rationing systems in light of it. Amid a devastating drought, governments should ensure that all households have enough water for basic needs before allowing golf courses to keep their fairways green — even if the latter can outbid the former in the marketplace.\nNevertheless, for several reasons, price controls generally aren’t the best way to ensure a just allocation of resources amid temporary shortages.\nFirst, a price control does not actually shift scarce goods towards the least fortunate: It caps the price that everyone pays — even the rich — rather than reducing costs specifically for the disadvantaged.\nSecond, a price control often functions like a tax on the production of a good that’s already in short supply. At an intuitive level, there’s an appeal to compensating the victims of high prices by taking money from those who are charging them the exorbitant rates: When tenants are paying high rents — and landlords are making large profits — there’s some justice in redistributing from the latter to the former. \nAnd yet, if there is a housing shortage, then funding transfers to working-class tenants by taxing producers of housing — rather than rich people in general — doesn’t make much sense. Doing so effectively encourages the wealthy to invest in anything besides new housing. \nThird, since price controls tend to undermine long-term supply, their ultimate distributional implications can be complex and regressive. Rent control does not simply transfer income from landlords to tenants. Rather, it often redistributes from newer residents to long-time ones, from younger households to older ones, and — over the long run — from renters to landlords by constraining new construction and driving up market rents.\nFor all these reasons, the best way to address short-term affordability challenges is to shift purchasing power from the rich to the working class through taxes and transfers. \nRamamurti and Mahoney dismiss this option on the grounds that giving people more money to purchase housing or electricity often pushes up demand, and thus, prices.\nYet if a transfer program is properly designed, this should not be too great a concern. The affluent account for a disproportionate share of consumption. So hiking their taxes will meaningfully reduce consumer demand. If the government then targets aid at those who are most in need, then it will increase that portion of the public’s purchasing power without putting much upward pressure on prices.\n“Temporary” price controls die hard\n\nOne surprising thing\nNew York enacted rent controls as an emergency measure during the post-World War II housing crunch, yet some restrictions persist to this day.\n\nRamamurti and Mahoney are well aware of price controls’ downsides. But they suggest these costs can be mitigated by making price caps temporary. In their view, if policymakers put “sunset clauses” into their rent or utility freezes, then such measures won’t take that big a bite out of long-term investment and supply.\nYet there’s a tension in this argument. On the one hand, Ramamurti and Mahoney suggest that voters won’t tolerate politicians who oppose new price controls. On the other hand, their plan assumes that electorates will allow future politicians to let already-existing price controls expire.\nThis isn’t logically contradictory. But it seems empirically dubious. After all, voters famously exhibit status-quo bias and loss aversion — which is to say, they prioritize avoiding losses over securing gains. For this reason, they are much more likely to punish politicians for taking away existing benefits than failing to create new ones.\nIf a price control is economically disastrous and unpopular, then this dynamic won’t prevent its repeal. Nixon had little trouble phasing out his price caps once they’d yielded shortages and inflation. But Ramamurti and Mahoney clearly presume that their price controls would be valued by some constituencies. And this has certainly been true of rent control: Those who happen to live in rent-controlled units tend to appreciate the policy. For precisely this reason, however, “temporary” rent controls tend to have staying power: New York implemented rent limits as an emergency measure after World War II. Yet various rent restrictions remain on the books in NYC to this day. \nThus, if policymakers must avoid permanent price controls — as Ramamurti and Mahoney seem to believe — it’s not clear why it would be politically easier for them to do this by implementing controls and then letting them expire, rather than simply never imposing controls in the first place.\nTo be fair, I suspect Ramamurti and Mahoney have an implicit answer to this: There is an affordability crisis today, but there won’t be one tomorrow, if policymakers take various steps to expand the supply of key goods. Therefore, demand for price controls will decline over time.\nBut there are two problems with that reasoning. First, as just noted, some rent control measures enacted amid acute shortages never fully expired, even during times when housing was relatively well-supplied. \nSecond, by historical standards, life is unusually affordable for Americans today. Accounting for inflation, the median US household earned a higher income in 2024 than at any time on record. Today, prices are rising at a historically unremarkable 3 percent rate, while unemployment is relatively low. \nNone of this means that ordinary Americans should be grateful for their lot. Housing is outrageously and needlessly expensive. The rich commandeer a grossly outsize share of wealth and growth. The typical US household may be better off today than it was in the past. But it could be dramatically more comfortable, if economic policy were more efficient and egalitarian. \nMy point is simply that today’s economic problems aren’t exceptional. If they constitute an emergency that demands price caps, then future conditions are liable to constitute the same — especially since price controls tend to make life less affordable over the long term.\nWhat voters want even more than price controls\nAll of this said, there may nevertheless be contexts where embracing temporary price controls is justified on political grounds. \nRent control polls extremely well. And the issue is highly salient in some places; it seems doubtful that an opponent of rent limitations could have won New York City’s mayoral race this year. \nPoliticians can’t implement reforms that truly enhance affordability if they cannot get elected. Further, there is some evidence that tenants are more supportive of new construction when they enjoy rent protections. \nFor these reasons, it’s conceivable that some municipal politicians can best advance the cause of housing abundance by embracing narrow forms of rent control.\nBut at the national level, neither party faces a political imperative to embrace price controls. Given this, they should not enact controls that will, in practice, make most people worse off — both because doing so is bad in principle and because voters are unlikely to reward politicians who deliver unpopular economic outcomes (no matter how well their counterproductive economic policies may initially poll). \nInstead, national candidates should campaign on the broad goal of making life more affordable for ordinary Americans — then, once in power, they should pursue policies that would actually do that. \nIn the peculiar market for prescription drugs — in which companies commonly hold patent monopolies that forbid competition and the government picks up much of the bill — this would likely involve imposing some price controls. When it comes to housing and energy, by contrast, delivering greater affordability will principally require cutting red tape and increasing public investment. Meanwhile, to ensure a more just distribution of scarce resources, policymakers can increase taxes on the rich and social welfare benefits for working people.\nPerhaps, this platform would buy candidates fewer votes than across-the-board price controls. But the latter’s cost is too damn high.",

        "text": "The housing market keeps getting worse. Home prices have risen more than 50 percent since the pandemic. About a third of Americans households now spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing. In 2014, the median age of a first-time homebuyer was 31. In 2025, it was 40 — the highest on record.\n\nThe core of the problem is simple: Too much money chasing too few homes. How many more homes does America need? I've seen estimates ranging from 2 million to 5 million. It's a shortage decades in the making — and one we're nowhere near on track to solving. In 2025, America built fewer homes per 100,000 people than it did in 2005, 1995, 1985 or 1975.\n\nEvery White House since President Barack Obama's administration has recognized the need to build more homes but the results, under both Democrats and Republicans, have been anemic. Housing is a hard problem to solve from the Oval Office. Zoning and building rules are set at the state and local levels. Interest rates are set by the Federal Reserve. In 2024, Kamala Harris promised to build 3 million new homes and released a plan that no housing expert I spoke to thought could come anywhere near achieving that goal.\n\n\" The thing that I think we learned is that federal housing policy is stuck in a really weak equilibrium,\" said Jared Bernstein, who led President Joe Biden's Council of Economic Advisers. \"There is just far too little asked of cities and states. They won't do much to push back on the barriers that are blocking affordable housing.\"\n\nBernstein, who is now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, wants to change that. He's among the authors of a new housing plan that tries to deliver the next administration a set of solutions nearer to the scale of the problem.\n\nAt the core of the center's plan is an idea it calls \"Rent Relief for Reform.\" I don't love the name, but I like the idea: Places with a housing shortage — and that's a lot of them — get a choice. Build the housing and the federal government will give all the renters in the city up to $1,000 off their rent — or don't build the housing and lose access to certain federal grants.\n\nThe Searchlight Institute, a new Democratic think tank, recently proposed a similar idea. In that version, cities and other places that hit ambitious housing targets would qualify for a federal rebate that would give every household — so both homeowners and renters — a check equal to the average increase in rent over the last year. In other words, build enough housing and the federal government will give the people who live near that housing money.\n\nBoth those ideas are trying to solve the hard problem at the heart of housing politics: It's the people who already have homes who have a voice in local politics and planning. They often like their neighborhood the way it is. They don't want more traffic or new neighbors or the hassle of nearby construction. What's in it for them?\n\n\"You can put this kind of crassly as you're incentivizing renters to show up at local elections and push their elected officials to do things that are renter-friendly, which I don't hate as a strategy,\" said Jenny Schuetz, who leads housing policy at Arnold Ventures. \"If most renters showed up in the primaries and demanded that their mayor and City Council actually do good things, we could have some pretty different outcomes. But mostly renters don't show up — particularly in the primary — and so you get these homeowner-dominated coalitions in cities that make it hard to build.\"\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nThe other problem is that even a housing policy that does benefit a community will do so slowly. It takes years to plan and build new homes. It takes time for new supply to lower costs. That time breaks the feedback loop between good policy and good politics. \" If you're a politician and you have a four-year term, you really need to do all of your housing stuff in year one if you want to have people feel the benefit within that single term,\" said Aaron Shroyer, who served as special assistant to Biden for housing policy and co-authored the Searchlight plan.\n\nSome polling Searchlight did is telling here. Seventy-nine percent of Americans say housing costs are \"too high\" or \"way too high.\" Sixty-two percent say it's become harder to find housing they can afford. But only 24 percent think building more housing in their community would lower costs. People do not believe building housing near them will benefit them. So policymakers need to create that benefit; they need to turn the indirect and slow gains of growth into something more visible and immediate for the community that is creating that growth.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nThe other big idea in the Center for American Progress plan is to change the way we build housing in America. \"If you go back to 1910, somebody showed up with a toolbox and a hammer to build a house,\" Bernstein said. \"And if you go to 2025, it's the same damn thing. This is the one sector where productivity has been literally falling for five decades while everything else has been going up.\"\n\nThe comparison that often gets made here is to manufacturing. Between 1950 and 2020, productivity in the manufacturing sector — how much you could produce with the same number of workers — rose by more than 900 percent. That's a big part of why everything from tables to televisions is cheaper today than decades ago. But over the same period, productivity in the construction sector has fallen. That's not the only reason housing is so expensive today, but it's part of it.\n\nBut you can manufacture housing — constructing homes in an off-site factory much the way we construct cars and then shipping them for final assembly. This is technology pioneered in the United States when George Romney, Mitt Romney's father, served as secretary of housing and urban development during the Nixon administration. But the United States never figured out the rules nor the financing to make an industry out of it. Instead, it's taken hold elsewhere. In Sweden, for example, more than 40 percent of new homes — and more than 80 percent of single-family homes — are fabricated off-site.\n\nThe Center for American Progress's plan proposes a slew of projects to take this industry America invented and make it one where America is a leader. They want the government to seed a major research program to fund innovation in housing construction. They want to have the federal government leverage its purchasing power to become an initial buyer for modular housing — one idea here would be to have the Department of Defense upgrade its military base housing using modular construction. They want to modernize building codes to make modular easier — removing, for instance, an outdated federal requirement to attach a permanent steel chassis to all modular construction — and updating federal insurance and financing rules to make sure modular production qualifies.\n\nYou could imagine states and cities acting even before the federal government does. \"New York was once a beacon of creative, public sector-led, affordable housing production,\" says Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's housing plan. \"But decades of disinvestment and shrinking government capacity have left us waiting on the real estate industry to solve a housing crisis from which they profit.\"\n\nLeft unsaid in his plan is that publicly subsidized, affordable housing has become monstrously expensive to construct because the public money triggers rules and process and reviews and negotiations that market-rate housing doesn't contend with. A Rand study found that, per square foot, affordable housing cost more than 1.5 times as much to build in California as market-rate housing; a Washington Post investigation revealed an affordable housing development in D.C. where the units cost $800,000 each to build, even as the same developer was building market-rate units for $350,000 next door. One reason we don't build enough affordable housing is we've made affordable housing unaffordable to build.\n\nMamdani proposed investing $100 billion to build 200,000 \"publicly subsidized, permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes\" over the next decade. That works out to $500,000 per unit — if all goes well. What if New York City became a test case for how modular construction could allow public housing, ordered and built at massive scale, in unionized factories, to become cheaper and faster to build than market-rate housing? If it was only $350,000 per unit, that would mean building almost 300,000 units for the same cost.\n\nOne problem the modular housing industry has faced is the absence of steady demand to keep the factories running and work out the kinks of construction. A place like New York City that wanted to build public housing at scale, over a long period of time, could create that steady demand and use it to seed an industry — New York could become America's leader in modular construction.\n\nPerhaps that's fanciful. But our thinking on housing — both public and private — has been far too small for far too long. We've accepted shocking cost increases paired with stagnating productivity. We've made it impossible for tens of millions of families to build the lives they want in the cities they'd ideally choose. At this point, making it possible to build more housing just isn't enough. We need to change how we build housing. I don't know if modular housing is really the answer. But it's worth trying.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.",

        "text": "“Late Night” host Seth Meyers on Monday revealed why President Donald Trump was so charmed by New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani during their Oval Office meeting.\n\n“I’ve never seen Trump this smitten before. This is a reminder: He doesn’t work with a single cool person!” Meyers said while showing an image of several Trump officials, including White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Vice President JD Vance. “He is surrounded by so many charmless goons that the first time he got to hang out with someone that had a little charisma, he swooned like he was on a date with the varsity quarterback.”\n\n“You’d have stars in your eyes, too, if you spent every day of your life with joyless gargoyles like Stephen Miller and JD Vance, and then you met a 34-year-old social media star who rapped in a halal cart and once appeared in an actual Disney movie,” he added.\n\nMoments later, Meyers played a clip of Trump interrupting Mamdani after a reporter asked the Democratic socialist about describing the president as a fascist.\n\n“That’s OK, you can just say ‘Yes,’ OK? It’s easier — it’s easier than explaining it, I don’t mind,” Trump said before patting Mamdani on the arm.\n\n“That is the flirtiest I’ve ever heard anyone say, ‘You can call me a fascist,’” Meyers quipped.\n\nHe then launched into his Trump impression: “You can call me a fascist, you can call me — I’ll be whatever you want me to be!”\n\nWatch more of Meyers’ Monday monologue on “Late Night.”",

It’s a quiet development, but a potentially transformative one, and Axios reports that senior Democratic National Committee officials have met with reform advocates to discuss making it real.\n\nRanked choice voting is simple at its core. Instead of marking only a single candidate on their ballot, voters rank the candidates in order of preference—first choice, second choice, third choice, and so on. If someone wins a majority of first-choice votes outright, the election is over. If nobody wins a majority, the last-place candidate is eliminated, and voters who ranked that candidate first have their second-choice votes counted. The process continues until one candidate grabs a majority of the vote. \n\nThe goal is to give voters more freedom to vote their values without worrying about “spoiler” candidates, while also encouraging campaigns to build broader coalitions.\n\nAccording to Axios, the conversation inside the party is still in its early stages. A formal move toward ranked choice voting would require layers of approval from the DNC’s rules and bylaws committee, buy-in from the larger membership, and cooperation from state parties—some of which would need legislative changes to adopt the system. \n\nThat’s a long road. But the fact that these discussions are happening signals something important: The existing primary model is divisive and has served our party’s broad base poorly.\n\nA primary system driven by majority support, not fractured pluralities\n\nParty stalwarts know the challenges primary season brings—the formation of camps as activists and rank-and-file Democrats pick their candidates. It is rarely enough to simply support one’s own; people feel pressure to tear down everyone else. Few of us are immune to those dynamics, including me. We are human, after all. \n\nBut ranked voting changes that dynamic. You can no longer alienate supporters of other candidates; you need them. Candidates have to court those voters, convince them that even if their first choice is someone else, they’re still worthy of a high ranking. Obnoxious, destructive behavior serves zero purpose.\n\nAn end to outsized early-state distortions\n\nRanked choice voting fixes some long-standing distortions in the primary calendar. Iowa and New Hampshire may no longer have top billing, but there will still be early states—meaning most of us still won’t have a meaningful voice in the opening rounds. Under the current system, those early results create intense pressure for candidates to consolidate or drop out. Ranked voting weakens that incentive. It rewards broad appeal rather than whoever happens to eke out, say, 22% in the first few contests.\n\nA check against media-manufactured momentum surges\n\nBy producing clearer, majority-driven outcomes, ranked voting blunts the breathless media narratives that inflate or deflate campaigns based on tiny, unrepresentative early-state pluralities. The early-state circus becomes less important, and candidates who don’t appeal to wide swaths of the electorate can’t ride a fluke finish into weeks of free media.\n\nProtection against crowded-field chaos in 2028\n\nRanked choice voting is also a hedge against crowded fields, which we’ll certainly have in the 2028 cycle. Under the current system, someone can walk away with the lead simply because everyone else cancels each other out. Ranked voting breaks that dynamic and ensures candidates can’t prevail with narrow, factional support.\n\nA boost for candidates who actually build coalitions\n\nRanked choice voting rewards candidates who do the hard organizing work—building relationships in multiple communities, showing up for constituencies outside their ideological home turf, and proving they can win not just a slice of the party but a majority of it. \n\nEven candidates who seem to win on “vibes,” like New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, succeed because that energy rests on top of real coalition work. His campaign may have projected momentum and enthusiasm online, but underneath that was the kind of multilingual, cross-community organizing that ranked voting structurally favors. \n\nThat kind of coalition building led to one primary ad in which Mamdani and one of his opponents, Comptroller Brad Lander, endorsed each other, telling their backers to rank the other person second.\n\nPut simply, vibes help, but they don’t replace the coalition—they amplify it.\n\nHigher turnout from voters who no longer fear “wasting” their vote\n\nA lot of people skip primaries because they think their preferred candidate isn’t “viable.” Ranked choice voting eliminates that psychological penalty. Voters can safely choose their favorite and still influence the final outcome. That especially matters for younger voters, working-class voters, and voters of color—exactly the parts of the Democratic coalition that benefit from having their voices counted in full.\n\nA calmer, more unified party heading into the general election\n\nRanked voting lowers the temperature inside the party. This isn’t about being nicer for the sake of niceness; it’s about avoiding the durable bitterness that can seep into the general election. When candidates need second-choice votes, they have real incentives to avoid torching their rivals’ supporters.\n\nSpace for ideological allies to cooperate instead of cannibalize\n\nIdeological blocs can work together rather than undermine each other. Imagine a 2020 Democratic primary cycle where Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders didn’t split the left but ran as an informal one-two ticket—encouraging their supporters to rank them together, strengthening each other rather than sabotaging both of them.\n\nA system that welcomes movement candidates without creating spoilers\n\nRanked choice voting discourages spoiler narratives without discouraging participation. Movement candidates, regional candidates, and single-issue candidates can all run without getting blamed for “splitting the vote.” The system absorbs that diversity instead of letting it distort the outcome.\n\nA nominee tested across the entire Democratic coalition\n\nPerhaps most importantly, ranked choice voting produces a nominee who has been tested across the full breadth of the party—someone who has earned not just passionate first-choice supporters but broad second-choice goodwill. That’s the kind of candidate who enters the general election stronger, more grounded, and with fewer wounds to heal.\n\nRanked choice voting in primaries won’t magically heal every tension inside the Democratic Party, and it won’t guarantee a drama-free primary season. Nothing ever does. But it does offer something better than what we have now. \n\nRanked voting rewards coalition building, respects the full diversity of the Democratic electorate, and reduces the incentives to burn down half the party in the name of a fleeting advantage. It gives voters more freedom, gives campaigns better incentives, and gives the eventual nominee a stronger foundation heading into the general election.\n\nWhether the DNC ultimately embraces the change or not, these discussions are an acknowledgment that the old model has limits—and that a healthier, more representative process is out there.",

        "text": "James Carville may be best known for a single line he uttered during the 1992 presidential race when he helped Bill Clinton defeat George H.W. Bush. The line was \"It's the economy, stupid\" and it wasn't just a random thought, it was Carville's strategy for capitalizing on voter dissatisfaction with the economy.\n\nJump forward 33 years and Carville now sees that a very similar message could provide Democrats a way out of the political dungeon they've found themselves in. He's mostly looking at the recent election in which affordability seems to have trumped (no pun intended) every other issue.\n\nZohran Mamdani, Abigail Spanberger, Mikie Sherrill — even down-ballot Georgia Democrats — all won with soaring margins because the people are pissed. And the people always point their anger at the party in charge. Rent is out of control. Young people can’t afford homes or pay student debt. We’re living through the greatest economic inequality since the Roaring Twenties.President Trump has done nothing to curb the cost of what it requires to take even a breath in America today, the centerpiece promise of his 2024 campaign. The people are revolting, and they have been for some time.\n\n\"The people are revolting and they have been for some time\" is a hilarious line. In any case, Carville says the key to giving Dems a second chance is to make the midterms all about economic rage.\n\nI am now an 81-year-old man and I know that in the minds of many, I carry the torch from a so-called centrist political era. Yet it is abundantly clear even to me that the Democratic Party must now run on the most populist economic platform since the Great Depression.It is time for Democrats to embrace a sweeping, aggressive, unvarnished, unapologetic and altogether unmistakable platform of pure economic rage. This is our only way out of the abyss...Just as it was for the Mamdani campaign, raging against the rigged, screwed-up, morally bankrupt system that gave us the cost of living crisis must be the centerpiece of every Democratic campaign in America. Unless you’re the top 1 percent, this touches everybody...We have to present ourselves as adamantly, even angrily, opposing the system that is preventing younger rural voters from buying homes, jacking up utility bills and keeping grocery prices at astronomical levels. It is vital that Democrats, with some big ol’ cojones, rail against the unjust economic system that has created these conditions.\n\nIs he right? Well, affordability does seem to be the issue that is driving voters at this moment. Of course, the reason affordability isn't great in the first place is that we had record inflation during the Biden administration. That inflation was partly caused by massive overspending championed by Democrats, including one massive bill absurdly labeled the Inflation Reduction Act. (Remember when Joe Manchin became public enemy #1 for trying to limit spending?)\n\nSomeone made this slightly silly but memorable chart.\n\nAngry about affordability? Why are prices so high?Blame Joe Biden.𝐈𝐍𝐅𝐋𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍 𝐑𝐀𝐓𝐄 𝐁𝐘 𝐏𝐑𝐄𝐒𝐈𝐃𝐄𝐍𝐓Trump 1.0 --> NO INFLATIONBiden --> RUNAWAY INFLATIONTRUMP 2.0 --> INFLATION COMES DOWN pic.twitter.com/ly9lR6HZ0R— Stephen Moore (@StephenMoore) November 14, 2025\n\nSo, yes, Carville is probably right that shrewd Democrats can escape responsibility for their own mess by suddenly becoming the champions of affordability. It's also true that the party in power usually suffers during the midterms, so they have historical precedent on their side.\n\nBut it's also true that President Trump and Republicans can fight for for affordability themselves. And they have the advantage of actually having political power to carry out their plans over the next year. If they can bring some prices down that should limit Democrats' ability to capitalize on the unhappiness with the economy they helped to create.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Hot Air's conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

        "text": "It’s no laughing matter.\n\nComedian Louis C.K. was recently caught kissing Philip Seymour Hoffman’s longtime partner, Mimi O’Donnell, 11 years after the acting legend’s fatal overdose.\n\nC.K., 58, was spotted walking arm-in-arm with O’Donnell through New York City over the weekend, per photos obtained by Daily Mail.\n\nMore pics showed the pair stopping to kiss during their romantic stroll through the Big Apple, while others saw the “Louie” star gently holding O’Donnell’s face in his hands.\n\nThe controversial comedian later removed his hat and took O’Donnell by the arm while a small white dog, which C.K. held by a leash, followed close behind.\n\nThe Post has reached out to C.K.’s reps for comment.\n\nHoffman dated O’Donnell for 15 years before his tragic drug death at the age of 46 on Feb. 2, 2014.\n\nAlthough the pair never married, they welcomed children Cooper, 22, Tallulah, 19, and Willa, 17, during their time together.\n\nO’Donnell reflected on the Oscar winner’s death and his struggle with addiction in a moving essay for Vogue in 2017. \n\nThe “Capote” star was found dead in his West Village apartment with 70 bags of heroin and 20 used needles inside, according to police.\n\n“It’s been almost four years since Phil died, and the kids and I are still in a place where that fact is there every day,” she wrote. “We talk about him constantly, only now we can talk about him without instantly crying.”\n\n“That’s the small difference, the little bit of progress that we’ve made,” O’Donnell continued. “We can talk about him in a way that feels as though there’s a remembrance of what happened to him, but that also honors him.”\n\nO’Donnell made headlines more recently for endorsing New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.\n\n“I love a progressive candidate. He’s got the energy. I love free child care, free buses. I like all the stuff he’s said,” Hoffman’s longtime girlfriend told The Post back in April.\n\nAs for C.K., he tied the knot with actress Alix Bailey in 1995. The pair welcomed daughters Kitty, 23, and Mary Louise, 20, before their divorce in 2008 after 13 years of marriage.\n\nThe surprising photos of the comedian and Hoffman’s ex kissing come nearly eight years after several women accused C.K. of sexual misconduct in a bombshell New York Times exposé.\n\nFive women claimed that the “Lucky Louie” comic, whose real name is Louis Alfred Székely, exposed himself and masturbated in front of them without their consent.\n\nC.K. later admitted to the allegations and issued a lengthy apology in 2017.\n\n“These stories are true,” he began. “At the time, I said to myself that what I did was okay because I never showed a woman my d–k without asking first, which is also true.”\n\n“The power I had over these women is that they admired me,” C.K. added. “And I wielded that power irresponsibly.”\n\nThe comedian came under fire again more recently for performing at the Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia.",

It often begins with a motorist’s refusal to give the officer a driver’s license, proceeding to the demand that the officer summon a supervisor, etc. Joe ended up in handcuffs in the back of a squad car, charged with assault and other crimes, adding to his already lengthy history of run-ins with the law.\n\nWhat causes these unnecessary confrontations? In a word, equality — or, as I’ve previously pointed out, Equality, with a capital “E,” denoting the quasi-religious faith in Equality common among liberals. “All men are created equal,” as our Declaration of Independence famously proclaimed, and that simple five-word phrase has become the foundation of a dangerous cult, which threatens to wreck the very nation that the Declaration announced our ancestors’ intent to create.\n\nEquality, as conceived by liberals, is not merely a political ideal, but a moral principle, so that any sort of inequality is to them a sort of sin. If your bank balance is even a dollar more than your neighbor’s, this is oppression — your poor neighbor is being oppressed and exploited, and you should feel guilty about it. Sins against the cult of Equality are denounced as injustice, and once someone starts viewing the world through such warped lenses, they see injustice everywhere. The rich are oppressing the poor, whites are oppressing racial minorities, men are oppressing women, so on and so forth, and the liberal will never find an end to these alleged injustices that cry out for remediation. (RELATED: The Dangerous Cult of Income Equality)\n\nIf you were fortunate enough to have studied political science under old-fashioned professors, as I did, you understand that the ideals expressed in the Declaration of Independence — “unalienable rights,” etc. — are somewhat self-contradictory. That is to say, equality and liberty are at odds with each other. People have different interests and different abilities, and, insofar as they have liberty to engage in what the Declaration calls “the pursuit of happiness,” their fortunes will vary greatly, so that they are not equal in terms of their income, wealth, and social status. To view this kind of naturally occurring inequality as proof of oppression is absurd, and yet it is on the basis of such a belief that liberals spend their lives crusading for what they think of as “social justice.”\n\nPermitted to advance unchecked, the Cult of Equality must ultimately destroy all established authority, all commerce and industry, and unleash bloody violence — e.g., the Khmer Rouge in “Year Zero” — before finally imposing absolute dictatorship.\n\nOf course, liberals deny any such intent, but the road to Hell is proverbially paved with good intentions, and liberals have become accustomed to not being confronted about their fanatical belief in Equality, by which so many evils may be justified. Given how common it is for children to be taught to revere Equality as an unquestionable good, even conservatives may hesitate to point out what’s wrong with this idea. It’s not politically popular to criticize Equality, or to defend any particular species of actual inequality, and so the liberal syllogism is permitted to avoid scrutiny of its basic premise.\n\nNew York City is preparing to inaugurate a new mayor who campaigned on a platform of wild-eyed radicalism. Zohran Mamdani has promised to freeze rents, to build thousands of “affordable housing” units at taxpayer expense, and to impose punitive taxation on the rich. Critics have pointed out the practical obstacles to Mamdani’s agenda, but the real question is why a majority of voters in New York City have bought the “democratic socialist” hokum that Mamdani is peddling. However bad the status quo in New York may be, what is the basis for the apparent belief of most New Yorkers that extreme left-wing measures are the solution to their problems? Is it just a blind hatred of the rich? (RELATED: The Mamdani Model: More Socialist Mayors to Come)\n\nHate can be a powerful force in politics, and the Cult of Equality justifies the kinds of hatred that Mamdani expresses, including his Hamas-style denunciations of Israel. Anyone can see that the Israelis are richer than their Palestinian neighbors and that, in terms of organized military power, Israel is vastly superior to any of its enemies. It is Israel’s success, contrasted to the failures of its neighbors, which has attracted the hatred of those like Mamdani who incite paranoia about a wicked Zionist conspiracy. (RELATED: The Anti-Colonial Shadow Over Mamdani’s Socialism)\n\nLet us return, now, to Joe and his traffic stop in Wisconsin. At the root of Joe’s confrontational defiance was his belief that he is equal to the cop — denying the police officer’s authority to order Joe to hand over his driver’s license. But it becomes impossible to enforce any law if the authority of duly-sworn officers is not recognized. We, as citizens, vote for legislatures that enact laws, and we elect local governments that hire police to enforce those laws. The Bill of Rights guarantees certain protections — habeas corpus, trial by jury, etc. — and with those guarantees in mind, a law-abiding citizen has no reason to fear the police, much less to take a defiant attitude toward the cop just doing his job.\n\n“You’ll have your day in court,” the supervising sergeant of the township police told Joe during the traffic stop that ended with Joe handcuffed in the back of the squad car. This was an adage among Americans for generations: “You’ll have your day in court,” meaning, basically, don’t argue with the cop, but take it up with the judge in whatever hearings or other court proceedings may follow. Some people, however, act as if police authority is an insult: “How dare this cop presume to boss me around?” To acquiesce with the officer’s orders would be to admit that the officer is in some way superior, and any kind of superiority is unacceptable to the Cult of Equality.\n\nJoe got a free ride to jail (not his first such ride) because he could not accept the reality of the officer’s lawful authority, and here, dear readers, you must excuse me for invoking a much higher authority. To put it bluntly, Joe needs Jesus, and so do we all.\n\nThe eighth chapter of Matthew’s gospel tells how, in Capernaum, a Roman centurion appealed to Jesus, “Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented”:\n\nAnd Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him. The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.\n\nJesus “marvelled” at the centurion’s expression of what it means to be “a man under authority” and, having praised the centurion for his “great faith,” said the word that accomplished his request, so that the centurion’s “servant was healed in the selfsame hour.”\n\nThese few verses are sufficient to inspire many lengthy sermons, but notice first that the centurion appealed for the healing of his own servant. A few years ago, when one of my sons was studying Hannibal’s invasion of Italy (218–204 B.C.), he remarked that historians now believe slaves constituted fully half of the population of the city of Rome at the time. Slavery was commonplace in the ancient world, and the fact that the Roman centurion had a servant was not remarkable.\n\nSecond, notice how the centurion abases himself to Jesus: “Lord, I am not worthy.” At the time, Judea was under the imperial yoke of Rome, so that an officer of the legions could expect any of the conquered Jews to show respect toward him, but this centurion was so desperate for the healing power of Jesus that he confessed his own unworthiness even to have him “come under my roof.” It was this that led the centurion to describe himself as “a man under authority,” requesting Jesus just to “speak the word” that would heal his servant, eliciting the response: “Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel…. And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee.”\n\nSet aside, for the sake of argument about more secular matters, whether the reader believes in the miracles recorded in the Bible. The point is that Christians, who do so believe, are called to emulate the example of Jesus in complying with lawful authority. Even when He was betrayed, persecuted, and crucified, Jesus did not resist. He came to serve as an atoning sacrifice, in fulfillment of prophecy, and we who call ourselves Christians are commanded to take up the cross and follow Him.\n\nThe police officer is “a man under authority.” Is that not apparent? Is further explanation needed? Why would Joe in Wisconsin, or anyone else, have a problem with the cop just doing his job? Isn’t such lawless defiance a predictable consequence of the Cult of Equality, which encourages fools to think there is no such thing as superior authority?\n\nWhen I was a boy attending Sunday School at the First Baptist Church of Lithia Springs, Georgia, obedience to authority was among the lessons most strenuously taught. It’s right there in the Ten Commandments: “Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land.” And this duty extended also to respecting civil authority, as the Apostle Paul admonished the early church in Rome: “Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God.”\n\nWe may observe that Paul was counseling those early believers to comply with “the powers that be” at a time when Christians faced persecution by Roman authority. The duty of being “subject unto the higher powers” was not contingent on whether those powers were exercised by godly men, or whether Christians suffered wrongly under the “powers that be.” Faith that everything is “ordained of God” — even our own suffering — is an obligation for all Christians, because we have the promise that one day we will have “our day in court,” at the Final Judgment, when our plea will be entered by He who healed the centurion’s servant.\n\nThe Cult of Equality is anti-Christian, both in the theological sense and in a practical sense. Paul warned the Ephesians to “put on the whole armour of God” in the struggle “against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.” In the very same chapter, however, Paul admonished children to obey their parents and servants to obey their masters. The Cult of Equality rejects traditional distinctions of authority, and the Christian church today faces no enemy more hostile than the atheistic radicalism of the Left.\n\nReal injustice and actual oppression are not so rare that they can be ignored, but the Cult of Equality conjures up imaginary victimhood — “heteronormative patriarchy,” “structural racism,” “systemic transphobia,” blah blah blah — to seduce its gullible followers into a delusional rage. Meanwhile, there are analogous delusions among the angry young men who heed a competing victimhood narrative (promoted by Nick Fuentes, among others), thinking themselves cheated out of what they deserve by Zionists and other enemies. It’s a crazy world we’re living in, where liberals claim that everybody is being oppressed by white men, while at the same time, some white men claim that they are the real victims of oppression.\n\nBack once again to that traffic stop in Wisconsin — Joe’s a white guy, and the officers arresting him were white, too. The last census found that Portage County is about 90 percent white, so there was no “racial injustice” involved in Joe getting manhandled into the back of a cop car. Joe nevertheless behaved like every BLM-inspired black suspect who decides to resist arrest because he believes his rights are being violated, turning a simple traffic stop or domestic disturbance case into a violent confrontation. Law enforcement officers risk their lives and, alas, too often lose their lives, because of the anti-police attitudes that have flourished in recent years. At the same time, calls to “defund the police” have endangered public safety, as has misguided leniency toward habitual criminals like Decarlos Brown.\n\nBy undermining law enforcement, the Cult of Equality endangers those “unalienable rights” which, in the words of the Declaration of Independence, governments are instituted to secure. When governments fail to protect the property and lives of their citizens, the result may be catastrophic — riots, anarchy, civil war. Why do you think it is, after all, that anarchist vandals in places like Seattle and Portland have made “ACAB” (All Cops Are Bastards) their most common graffiti slogan?\n\nNowhere is the Cult of Equality’s anti-law enforcement attitude more evident now than in the Left’s attempts to obstruct the Trump administration’s effort to apprehend and deport illegal aliens. Liberals have adopted such a radical egalitarian stance that they view any random foreigner as having an “equal right” to reside in the United States, no matter what the law says. Thus, the Salvadoran gangster Kilmar Garcia is described as a “Maryland man,” without regard either to his immigration status or the crimes he has committed since illegally crossing the border. Democrat politicians actively encourage attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents — calling them “Gestapo,” “Nazis,” “thugs,” etc. Why? Because somehow Democrats, in their maniacal devotion to the Cult of Equality, consider it unfair to enforce immigration law. (RELATED: The Geography of Defiance)\n\nWe are in a dangerous place, politically, when such contempt for authority is promoted by those who style themselves defenders of “Our Democracy.” It’s not just idiots getting themselves arrested because they can’t cope with a simple traffic stop. It’s members of Congress indicted for obstructing ICE agents. America itself is at risk when lawmakers become lawbreakers, but this is where the fanatical belief in Equality leads, and destruction awaits if we do not reverse course.\n\nREAD MORE from Robert Stacy McCain:\n\nDots and Patterns: What History Can Teach Us\n\nDemons and Demonization\n\nThe Historic Roots of Russiagate",

        "text": "Rioters outside Park East synagogue in New York recently chanted genocidal screeds such as “There is only one solution: intifada revolution” and “we don’t want no two states, we want all of it.”\n\nBut rather than unequivocally condemn the rabid antisemitism inherent in the protests, New York City’s mayor elect Zohran Mamdani’s office chose to not only tokenize synagogues as “sacred spaces,” but to then also condemn the synagogue and its event guest, Nefesh B’Nefesh, an organization that strives to get Jews to move to Israel, as “promot[ing] activities in violation of international law.” (RELATED: The New York Times Sets a New Low on Israel)\n\nAs I have argued before, far before fungible, fair-weathered concepts of “international law” ever existed, Jews were the indigenous people of the Land of Israel, having sovereignty or pseudo-sovereignty there during:\n\nThe Kingdom of Israel (1020 to 930 BCE);The northern Kingdom of Israel (930 BCE to 720 BCE);The southern Kingdom of Judah (930 BCE to 586 BCE);The Yehud under the Neo-Babylonian/Chaldean Empire (586 BCE-539 BCE);The Yehud Medinata under the Persian Achaemenid Empire (539 BCE to 332 BCE);The Hasmonean Dynasty under the Greek Seleucid Empire (164 BCE to 63 BCE)The Hasmonean Dynasty under the Roman Empire (63 BCE to 40 BCE);The Herodian Dynasty under the Roman Empire (37 BCE to 6 BCE);The First Jewish-Roman War (66 CE to 73 CE);The Palestinian Patriarchate under the Roman Empire (80 CE to 425 CE)Full independence from the Roman Empire as a result of the Bar Kokhba Rebellion (132 CE to 135 CE); andJewish autonomy in Jerusalem under the Persian Sasanian Empire during the Jewish revolt against Heraclius (614-617 CE).\n\nApparent in the above timeline is not only the millennia-old Jewish ties to the Land of Israel, but that the Jews regained control of it several times after losing it to colonizers: in 586 BCE under the prophets Ezra and Nehemiah (brokered with King Cyrus, who allowed the Jews to return following Persia’s defeat of the Babylonians), under the Hasmonean Dynasty (featured in the story of Hanukkah when the Jews defeated the Greeks), several times during the Roman Empire, during the Jewish revolt against Heraclius from 614-617 CE, and finally during the re-establishment of Israel in 1948.\n\nMamdani slanders Jews and Judaism, as a yearning for the Jews to return to the Land of Israel is baked into Judaism itself. In the liturgy, Jews have prayed to return to the Land of Israel since Time Immemorial. Jews conclude the Passover Seder and the Yom Kippur service (“Neilah”) with the words “Next Year in Jerusalem.” The Grace After Meals pines for the restoration of Jerusalem. (RELATED: Israel, the Church, and the Unraveling of Conservative Unity)\n\nPsalm 137:1 states that during the Babylonian Captivity, “By the Rivers of Babylonian we sat and wept when we remembered Jerusalem.” Psalm 137:5 states, “If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand lose its skill.”\n\nThe Jews’ return to the land of Israel is predicted in the Hebrew Bible. According to Deuteronomy 30:1-5,\n\nWhen all these things have happened to you, the blessings and the curses that I have set before you, if you call them to mind among all the nations where the Lord your God has driven you, and return to the Lord your God, and you and your children obey him with all your heart and with all your soul, just as I am commanding you today, then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you, gathering you again from all the peoples among whom the Lord your God has scattered you. Even if you are exiled to the ends of the world, from there the Lord your God will gather you, and from there he will bring you back. The Lord your God will bring you into the land that your ancestors possessed, and you will possess it; he will make you more prosperous and numerous than your ancestors.\n\nAnd Isaiah 11:11-12 states,\n\nAnd it shall come to pass that on that day, the Lord shall continue to apply His hand a second time to acquire the rest of His people, that will remain from Assyria and from Egypt and from Pathros and from Cush and from Elam and from Sumeria and from Hamath and from the islands of the sea. And He shall raise a banner to the nations, and He shall gather the lost of Israel, and the scattered ones of Judah He shall gather from the four corners of the earth.\n\nAnd Ezekiel 20:41-42 states, “With a pleasing savor I shall accept you when I take you out of the nations, and I shall gather you from the lands in which you were scattered, and I shall be hallowed through you before the eyes of the nations. And you will know that I am the Lord when I bring you to the land of Israel, to the land that I lifted My hand to give to your forefathers.”\n\nJeremiah 29:14 states that “And I will be found by you, says the Lord, and I will return your captivity and gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I have driven you, says the Lord, and I will return you to the place whence I exiled you.” Jeremiah 31:17 states, “There is hope for your future, says the Lord, and your children will return to their border.”\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Zion is mentioned 152 times in the Hebrew Bible and Jerusalem 669 times. Israel and Judah (as the names of land, in addition to the names of the biblical figures from whom they are named) are obviously in there, too.\n\nAnd if not because of all that, Mamdani should know that the Quran states that the land belongs to the Jews and that they will return to it.\n\nAs the prophet Isaiah stated in Isaiah 62:1, “For the sake of Zion I will not be quiet, and for the sake of Jerusalem I will not be still.” So let it be known that Mamdani defames Jews and Judaism by undermining the Jews’ inalienable right to live in (and return to) their ancestral homeland, the Land of Israel.\n\nREAD MORE from Steve Postal:\n\nWill Trump Get Saudi Arabia to Join the Abraham Accords?\n\nKazakhstan Joins the Abraham Accords.

        "text": "New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani revealed the “weirdest” thing he observed during his visit to the White House to meet President Donald Trump in an appearance on The Adam Friedland Show on Monday.\n\nWhen Friedland asked, “What was the weirdest thing he [Trump] showed you?” Mamdani said on the web-based talk show, “I sit down, waiting for the time of the meeting, and in front of me are all of these different coffee table books. And one of them is UFC at the White House. I had no idea, and I was just flippin’, flippin’ through that.”\n\nPressed on whether he would go to the White House UFC event scheduled for June 2026, Mamdani simply said, “No,” drawing a laugh from Friedland and himself.\n\n View this post on Instagram A post shared by THE ADAM FRIEDLAND SHOW (@theadamfriedlandshow)\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nThe lighthearted comments stand in stark contrast to the contentious relationship between the two politicians during the mayoral campaign. Mamdani defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary, then faced Cuomo again in the general election after he launched an independent bid alongside Republican Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani won the November 4 election with a clear majority.\n\nTrump repeatedly criticized Mamdani throughout the race, calling him a “communist lunatic” while questioning his fitness for office. The president also threatened to withhold federal funding from New York if Mamdani won.\n\nHowever, Trump appeared to completely reverse course after meeting Mamdani at the White House last week, showering the mayor-elect with glowing praise while fully endorsing him. Trump said he would feel comfortable living in Mamdani’s New York.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nDuring the interview, Friedland questioned how Mamdani maintained composure during the White House press conference, noting observers were surprised by his calm demeanor. When asked how he kept a straight face, Mamdani said he stayed focused by concentrating on his priorities for the city.\n\n“Honestly, I was just thinking about New York City,” Mamdani told Friedland.\n\nThe interview then turned to unusual elements of the White House visit. When Friedland asked about the strangest thing Mamdani encountered, the mayor-elect described his pre-meeting experience.\n\n“I sit down waiting for the time of the meeting, and in front of me are, like, all these different coffee table books, and one of them is UFC at the White House,” Mamdani said. “I had no idea, but I was just flippin’, flipping through that.”\n\nMamdani has provided additional details about his White House visit in other media appearances. During an NBC News Meet the Press interview with host Kristen Welker, he addressed the moment when reporters asked if he still considers Trump a fascist. Trump interjected that he didn’t mind the characterization because it was “easier than explaining” alternative views.\n\nMamdani confirmed he maintains that position but emphasized the productive nature of their discussion. He said their conversation focused on affordability issues including housing costs, childcare expenses, grocery prices, utility bills, themes central to his campaign.\n\nThe mayor-elect identified specific obstacles to addressing these concerns, citing zoning regulations, approval processes, construction costs. He particularly highlighted childcare expenses, noting they represent the second-largest cost for families at $22,500 annually per child.\n\nMamdani explained his strategy of building a working relationship with the federal government by emphasizing shared priorities. He referenced conversations with New York voters who supported Trump, using their concerns to find common ground with the president.\n\nThe meeting extended beyond the Oval Office to include time in the Cabinet Room, where Mamdani said they viewed historical presidential portraits, including one of former president Franklin D. Roosevelt. He drew parallels between his vision for New York and the legendary partnership between Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia and FDR during the New Deal era.\n\n“You can’t tell the story of LaGuardia without telling the story of FDR and the story of a relationship with the federal government that finally delivered at the scale of the crisis it was facing,” Zohran said. \n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Truth Social wrote: “It was a Great Honor meeting Zohran Mamdani, the new Mayor of New York City!”\n\nNew York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani wrote on X: “Working people have been left behind in New York. In the wealthiest city in the world, one in five can’t afford $2.90 for the train or bus. As I told Trump today—it’s time to put those people right back at the heart of our politics.”\n\nWhat Happens Next?\n\nMamdani takes office on New Year’s Day 2026.",

I hate it.\"\n\nIt was your typical virtue signalling BS, telling her audience that she was cool, unlike those flag-waving neanderthals who enjoy country music and those retrograde women who like to get dressed up and made up. \n\nShe is an AWFL, not one of those rubes. Ed has more on her disastrous performance on MS-NOW, or what Ed cheekily calls M-SNOW, since snow jobs are what they specialize in. \n\nHer latest...gaffe?...was her utter inability to address the fact that she was tweeting out all the leftist BS about eliminating police departments, as well as her musings about how she can get away with things that others can't because she is an AWFL. \n\nQ. So you don't want to clarify whether you still believe that the police should be defunded?Behn: ...once again, I....don't remember these tweets...Q. What is your position today, hows that, on this issue?Behn: .....once again, I'm here to talk about my race, which is,… https://t.co/5HgNBkCsGW— Mary Margaret Olohan (@MaryMargOlohan) November 24, 2025\n\nA transcript of her comments and Ed's wry response:\n\nQ: Representative, in 2020 you made some tweets that have since been deleted, that were very critical of police. You said, in those since-deleted tweets, that the Metropolitan Police Department in Nashville should be dissolved, another shared on a teacher's union tweet that Defund the Police should be a requirement for schools reopening, and another saying \"Good morning to the 54% of Americans who believe that burning down a police station is justified.\" 2020 was a very fraught year. Do you still stand by those comments, and if not, is there anything you want to clarify?BEHN: Uh – I'm not going to engage in cable-news talking points, but what I will say is our communities need solutions, we need local people deciding, solving local problems with local solutions. And that's not the overreach of a federal government or a state government, of which we are dealing with in Nashville and our cities across the state of Tennessee. If Behn does not want to \"engage in cable-news talking points,\" why is she making an appearance on cable news? It's not as if Behn wandered into a TV studio accidentally. Behn did the interview in an attempt to rescue her special-election campaign in a congressional district that has a Cook index of R+10 and which went for Donald Trump and Marsha Blackburn last year, 60/38. \n\nBehn is, as you can see, a terrible candidate, about as electable as...Jay Jones. \n\nWhich is my point. Democrats keep nominating terrible candidates with backgrounds that should be immediately disqualifying, but it doesn't seem to matter in some cases. Chesa Boudin got elected as the chief law enforcement officer of San Francisco, Jay Jones as Attorney General, and Zohran Mamdani as Mayor of New York City. I could go on, but you get the point. \n\nFor God's sake, Brandon Johnson got elected as Mayor of Chicago! He is more dedicated to Marxism than Mamdani and twice as racist. \n\nDemocrats love their awful candidates, although Boudin was so awful that he got booted. So there is that.\n\nIt's not that Republicans haven't nominated some real clunkers. For all his virtues, Trump is at least partly responsible for some of them. But in many of those cases, the clunkers lost because voters—even voters in love with Trump—exercise at least a modicum of personal judgment. \n\nDemocrats seem to vote on only one issue: opposition to Donald Trump. Their loyalty to that cause is so much greater than to the country or common sense that they will fill out that oval for a serial killer, it seems. They have come close enough, and I hope the experiment is never run. \n\nFor all the talk about love of democracy and belief in the good of the country, that is complete BS. If you voted for Jay Jones, you don't give a damn about anything but knifing Republicans in the back. \n\nDemocrats like to claim that Republicans are in a cult. To which I say: look in the mirror, folks. You are projecting something fierce. \n\nEditor’s Note: Every single day, here at Hot Air, we will stand up and FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT against the radical left and deliver the conservative reporting our readers deserve.

        "text": "Just a few months ago, it seemed that the political landscape was changing permanently, with young people shifting right – especially young men. Democrats spun up a vortex of efforts to win them back, but they often appeared to be flailing. This month’s elections, however, told a different story.\n\nYoung men in the US face a political identity crisis. It should not be controversial to say that the world that many were promised as children has not come to fruition. Two decades of war and a turbulent economy have combined with a massively changing workforce. Young men’s disaffection should come as no real surprise.\n\nAn entire ecosystem of hucksters has emerged to take advantage of these young people, peddling a dark vision that offers violence and control as a response to a changing world. Meanwhile, the Democratic party failed to imagine a political future that included these young men. In Democrats’ parlance, anyone who took one step in that direction was hopelessly lost, unable to see the beautiful egalitarian future that we could create together.\n\nThere is a fine line here. I am not arguing for the redemption, welcome, or whitewashing of the people who have peddled this bleak reality. But we can and should build a political coalition that includes this generation, that doesn’t leave them out in the cold, only to find a home in the most bleak fringes of a political movement that tells them that a lust for control over other people, especially women, is the only way to find meaning.\n\nOn the left, we tell ourselves the story of our own vaunted sympathy, and yet we assign only blame to the young men who do something similar, looking for community and only finding it among the most opportunistic and dangerous political movements. We have done little to welcome them in.\n\nAnd while Democrats had solid policies and economic plans, Republicans, backed by an army of digital content, were able to take the mantle of running on the economy and framing the left as cultural warriors out of touch with the majority of Americans.\n\nBut the good news is that this month’s elections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City show Democrats have learned a lesson.\n\nThe three marquee campaigns of this year were all remarkably similar, despite coming from different parts of the ideological spectrum. Their messaging was relentlessly focused on affordability – how expensive and difficult life has become for the working and middle-class people of their communities. Their solutions covered a wide ideological range, but the focus remained the same.\n\nMost young men, like most trans people and Black people and immigrants and everyone else, are dealing with housing that has skyrocketed in price, especially compared with our parents’ generations. Instead of having one career in our lifetimes, we now have to continually seek new jobs. Living independently as an adult is much more expensive and complicated now than it has been. These affordability campaigns gave young men something to do about those pressures rather than ceding that frustration to the most cynical actors.\n\nUndoubtedly this conversation is easier to have when Donald Trump is taking three steps every day to dismantle the economy. There’s a real sense that the economy is getting worse. That it’s more difficult to pay bills and keep food on the table, especially when Republicans are, quite literally, ensuring that 42 million people cannot afford to keep food on their table by refusing to fund Snap during their government shutdown.\n\nRepublicans got distracted, trying to defend Trump and also trying to repeat his playbook of tying Democrats to the culture war of the moment. But without Trump’s singular ability to control a media narrative, Republicans with far less political talent and capital floundered, making themselves look weak and silly in the process.\n\nThe political miracle is that this ruthless focus on affordability and cost of living may have brought in many of those same young men who had followed Trump a year ago. In Virginia and New Jersey, men under 30 broke for their new Democratic governors, with about six in 10 supporting Spanberger, according to the AP. In New York, young men went for Zohran Mamdani over Andrew Cuomo by a margin of nearly 40 points, according to a Tufts Circle analysis.\n\nIt turns out that these young men are not completely lost to us. We just failed to imagine a reality where they could be in our camp.\n\nAffordability broke through amid the longest government shutdown in US history, as consumer prices were rising ever higher thanks in part to Trump’s tariffs. For all of his bluster, eventually the economic reality becomes an unavoidable political crisis for anyone not far gone in his cult of personality who has to pay their bills.\n\nMikie Sherrill in New Jersey, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, and Mamdani in New York City showed us that the frustration that every working and middle-class person feels could be directed into a political coalition that sees marginalized people as people also affected by the greed and corruption that has made life unaffordable for so many.\n\nYoung men, like everyone else, are looking for a politics that can make life a little better. Democrats are finally figuring out how to offer them that chance.\n\n Cory Alpert is a PhD researcher at the University of Melbourne looking at the impact of AI on democracy.

        "id": 381896812,
        "text": "Over the weekend, Elon Musk’s X rolled out a feature that had the immediate result of sowing maximum chaos. The update, called “About This Account,” allows people to click on the profile of an X user and see such information as: which country the account was created in, where its user is currently based, and how many times the username has been changed. Nikita Bier, X’s head of product, said the feature was “an important first step to securing the integrity of the global town square.” Roughly four hours later, with the update in the wild, Bier sent another post: “I need a drink.”\n\nAlmost immediately, “About This Account” stated that many prominent and prolific pro-MAGA accounts, which signaled that they were run by “patriotic” Americans, were based in countries such as Nigeria, Russia, India, and Thailand. @MAGANationX, an account with almost 400,000 followers and whose bio says it is a “Patriot Voice for We The People,” is based in “Eastern Europe (Non-EU),” according to the feature, and has changed its username five times since the account was made, last year. On X and Bluesky, users dredged up countless examples of fake or misleading rage-baiting accounts posting aggressive culture-war takes to large audiences. An account called “Maga Nadine” claims to be living in and posting from the United States but is, according to X, based in Morocco. An “America First” account with 67,000 followers is apparently based in Bangladesh. Poetically, the X handle @American is based in Pakistan, according to the feature.\n\nAt first glance, these revelations appear to confirm what researchers and close observers have long known: that foreign actors (whether bots or humans) are posing as Americans and piping political-engagement bait, mis- and disinformation, and spam into people’s timeline. (X and Musk did not respond to my requests for comment.)\n\nX’s decision to show where accounts are based is, theoretically, a positive step in the direction of transparency for the platform, which has let troll and spam accounts proliferate since Musk’s purchase, in late 2022. And yet the scale of the deception—as revealed by the “About” feature—suggests that in his haste to turn X into a political weapon for the far right, Musk may have revealed that the platform he’s long called “the number 1 source of news on Earth” is really just a worthless, poisoned hall of mirrors.\n\nIf only it were that simple. Adding to the confusion of the feature’s rollout are multiple claims from users that the “About” function has incorrectly labeled some accounts. The X account of Hank Green, a popular YouTuber, says his account is based in Japan; Green told me Sunday that he’d never been to Japan. Bier posted on X that there were “a few rough edges that will be resolved by Tuesday,” referring to potentially incorrect account information. (On some accounts, a note is appended pointing out that the user may be operating X through a proxy connection, such as a VPN, which would produce misleading information.) For now, the notion that there might be false labels could give any bad actor the ability to claim they’ve been mislabeled.\n\nThis is the final post-truthification of a platform that long ago pivoted toward a maxim used by the journalist Peter Pomerantsev to refer to post-Soviet Russia: Nothing is true and everything is possible. This is how you get people apparently faking that the Department of Homeland Security’s account was created in Israel (a claim that has 2 million views and counting); both DHS and Bier had to intervene and assure users that the government’s account was not a foreign actor. High-profile right-wing accounts that previously served as yes-men for Musk—such as Ian Miles Cheong, a Malaysian who purportedly lives in the United Arab Emirates and posts incessant, racist drivel about American politics—have melted down over the platform’s decision to dox users.\n\nAcross the site, people are using the feature to try to score political points. Prominent posters have argued that the mainstream media have quoted mislabeled accounts without “minimum due diligence.” This nightmare is not limited to trolls or influencers. On Sunday, the Israel Foreign Ministry posted a screenshot of an account that purported to be reporting news from Gaza, next to a screenshot saying it was based in Poland. “Reporting from Gaza is fake & not reliable. Makes you wonder how many more fake reports have you read?” In response, the person in question posted a video on X on Sunday evening insisting he was in Gaza, living in a tent after military strikes killed his wife and three children. “I’ve been living in Gaza, I am living now in Gaza, and I will continue living in Gaza until I die.”\n\nWatching all of this unfold has been dizzying. On Sunday, I encountered a post claiming that, according to the “About” feature, a popular and verified Islamophobic, pro-Israel account (that posts aggressively about American politics, including calling for Zohran Mamdani’s deportation) was based in “South Asia” and had changed its username 15 times. When I went to X to verify, I noticed that this same account had spent Saturday posting screenshots of other political accounts, accusing them of being fake “Pakistani Garbage.” This is X in 2025: Potentially fake accounts crying at other potentially fake accounts that they aren’t real, all while refusing to acknowledge that they themselves aren’t who they say they are—a Russian nesting doll of bullshit.\n\nThere are a few ways to interpret all of this. First is that this is a story about incentives. Platforms not only goad users into posting more and more extreme and provocative content by rewarding them with attention; they also help people monetize that attention. Just before the 2016 election, BuzzFeed’s Craig Silverman and Lawrence Alexander uncovered a network of Macedonian teens who recognized that America’s deep political divisions were a lucrative vein to exploit and pumped out bogus news articles that were designed to go viral on Facebook, which they then put advertisements on. Today it’s likely that at least some of these bogus MAGA accounts make pennies on the dollar via X’s Creator program, which rewards engaging accounts with a cut of advertising revenue; many of them have the telltale blue check mark.\n\nAs Bellingcat’s Eliot Higgins noted on Bluesky, X’s architecture turns what should be an information ecosystem into a performative one. “Actors aren’t communicating; they’re staging provocations for yield,” he wrote. “The result is disordered discourse: signals detached from truth, identity shaped by escalation, and a feedback loop where the performance eclipses reality itself.” Beyond the attentional and financial rewards, platforms such as X have gutted their trust-and-safety or moderation teams in service of a bastardized notion of free-speech maximalism—creating the conditions for this informational nightmare.\n\nThe second lesson here is that X appears to be inflating the culture wars in ultimately unknowable but certainly important ways. On X this weekend, I watched one (seemingly real) person coming to terms with this fact. “Fascinating to look through every account I’ve disagreed with and find out they’re all fake,” they posted on Saturday. To be certain, X is not the main cause for American political division or arguing online, but it is arguably one of its greatest amplifiers. X is still a place where many journalists and editors in newsrooms across America share and consume political news. Political influencers, media personalities, and even politicians will take posts from supposed ordinary accounts and hold them up as examples of their ideological opponents’ dysfunction, corruption, or depravity.\n\nHow many of these accounts, arguments, or news cycles were a product of empty rage bait, proffered by foreign or just fake actors? Recent examples suggest the system is easily gamed: 32 to 37 percent of the online activity around Cracker Barrel’s controversial logo change this summer was driven by fake accounts, according to consultants hired by the restaurant chain. It’s impossible to know the extent of this manufactured outrage, but it doesn’t necessarily matter—the presence of so much fakery makes it possible to cast aspersions on any piece of information, any actor, or any conversation to the point that the truth is effectively meaningless.\n\nIt’s worth stepping back to see this for what it is: the complete perversion of the actual premise of not just social media but the internet. Although this crisis centers on X, most major social-media networks have fallen victim to variants of this problem. Fakery and manipulation are inevitable for platforms at this scale. Even when Twitter and Facebook were more committed to battling outside influence or enforcing platform rules, they were playing whack-a-mole. The idealism that these companies were founded with—Mark Zuckerberg wanted to connect the world, and Musk has said he wants to maximize free speech (Twitter’s original founders used similar language)—has decayed as they steered their products toward maximizing profits and playing politics. The self-proclaimed techno-utopians in Silicon Valley who have helped build, invest in, or cheerlead for these companies have enabled this ruin. They’ve traded reality for profit and prioritized technologies that aren’t just soulless and amoral, but inhuman in the most literal sense of the word.\n\nA rational response to all of this would be for people to log off. Indeed, that now seems like the least likely, but most optimistic, conclusion—that a group of people who realize they’re being goaded into participation in an algorithmic fun house decide to opt out of a psychologically painful discourse trap altogether. We should all be so lucky.",

        "text": "Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said she has no intention to cozy up with President Trump to secure more favorable treatment for the city, after learning of a friendly White House meeting between Trump and New York City’s new socialist mayor.\n\nUnlike New York City’s Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who met with Trump last Friday, Wu, a progressive Democrat reelected to a second term earlier this month, said she would not accept an invitation to the White House to meet with the Republican president.\n\n“I’m not interested in a bromance with the federal regime,” Wu told reporters Monday at an unrelated event in Jamaica Plain.\n\nWu, who has been thrust into the national spotlight for her defiance of the Trump administration since her March testimony before a Republican-led Congressional oversight committee in defense of the city’s sanctuary policies and protections for illegal immigration, said she plans to stick to her guns.\n\n“Every community has their unique and individual contexts, and every city leader, every university, every law firm, has to make their own decisions about how they handle this moment,” Wu said. “On my part, I am fighting as hard as I possibly can to stop the actions of a federal government that seems intent on attacking its own people.”\n\nMamdani and leaders of other communities may choose to try to broker a stronger working relationship with the Trump administration in light of threatened federal funding cuts, but Wu said that’s not the right approach.\n\n“From my point of view, flattery is not the way,” Wu said. “Boston residents want us to stand strong on our values and to get things done and to keep moving forward, and that’s what we’re going to continue to do.”\n\nLast week’s meeting between Trump and Mamdani, a respective Republican and socialist Democrat, was expected to be frosty, but turned out to be remarkably amiable, with both men speaking repeatedly of their shared goals to help Trump’s hometown rather than their combustible differences.\n\nTrump, who had in the past called Mamdani a “100% communist lunatic” and a “total nut job,” spoke openly of how impressed he was with the man who had called his administration “authoritarian.”\n\nWu said she would only accept a similar invitation to meet with the president at the White House if he met a list of her demands.\n\n“If (the invitation) came with a promise to stop snatching residents illegally off the streets, stop prosecuting his political enemies, stop cutting life-saving research and funding,” Wu said, “Sure, I would be open to a conversation at that point.”\n\nMaterial from the Associated Press was used in this report.",

        "text": "He’s governing by committee.\n\nTwo New York City Democratic Socialists of America leaders scored plum roles on Zohran Mamdani’s transition team — as the mayor-elect Monday named a who’s who of progressive advocates and veterans of Bill de Blasio’s administration to staff its committees.\n\nThe 400 comrades tapped by Mamdani to help his transition into City Hall include the local DSA’s co-chairs Gustavo Gordillo and Grace Mausser, who recently bragged that the mayoral election’s outcome counted as a “mandate” for their shared socialist agenda.\n\n“We’re looking to actually build a very different City Hall,” Mamdani, a DSA member, said during a press conference in East Harlem announcing his 17 transition team committees.\n\nGordillo will serve on the economic development and workforce development committee, while Mausser was named to the committee on small businesses and Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise.\n\nThe committees largely follow the template of past mayoral turnovers, covering traditional issues such as health and economic development — with the exception of two new ones focused on the lefty causes of “community organizing” and “worker justice.”\n\nMore than 70,000 New Yorkers applied from every single ZIP code in the city to work in Mamdani’s administration when he takes office Jan. 1, Mamdani said.\n\nWhether Mamdani will lean on his largely untested lefty allies — especially from the DSA — or tap veteran public servants for his City Hall staff has been an open question, but the makeup of his transition brain trust skews toward experience.\n\nSeveral notable high-profile names on the committees include:\n\nFormer FDNY Commissioner Laura Kavanagh, a veteran of Eric Adams’ administration, who is on the government operations committee.\n\nRodney Harrison, a widely respected NYPD and Suffolk County police official, will serve on the community safety committee.\n\nDe Blasio’s former health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot sits on the health committee.\n\nKathryn Wylde — who heads the business group Partnership for New York City, is part of Mamdani’s economic and workforce development committee.\n\nJed Walentas, the chair of Real Estate Board of New York, gives the real estate industry a voice in Mamdani’s transition as part of its housing committee.\n\nChristine Marinoni, wife of lefty “Sex and the City” actress and onetime gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon, is on the youth and education committee. She had donated $1,100 to Mamdani’s campaign.\n\nMamdani was flanked by several lower-profile, but still influential advocates and experts who’ll be part of his transition committees — including Annemarie Gray, executive director of the vocal YIMBY group Open New York, on one focused on housing.\n\nGray, who’s also a veteran of the de Blasio administration, and Open New York helped push voters to pass ballot measures giving the mayor new powers over building new housing.\n\n“I joined this committee because Zohran is committed to an all-of-the-above approach to the housing crisis that we know New York City needs, one that protects current tenants, while also building the homes of future families,” she said.\n\nThe two new committees consist of a grab bag of local organizers, labor leaders and policy experts, including Ai-jen Poo, who heads the National Domestic Workers Alliance, received a 2014 MacArthur “Genius” Grant and once attended the Golden Globes with actress Meryl Streep.\n\nMamdani argued the worker justice committee was necessary because of how the city has failed blue-collar New Yorkers in the past.\n\nHe said the community organizing committee likewise addresses a gap.\n\n“There has too often been a distance between the intent of what City Hall does and the impact of what it actually has in any given neighborhood across the five boroughs,” he said. “And you will typically find out from the New Yorkers who live there of the ways in which it’s fallen short.\n\n“We want to use this period as an opportunity where we learn from those lessons, we learn from that history, and we also learn how City Hall could be far more effective in actually executing its vision.”\n\n— Additional reporting by Carl Campanile",

        "text": "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries insisted Monday that he didn’t coordinate with Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on the New York City Democratic Socialists of America’s decision not to endorse his primary challenger. \n\n“No. We’re focused on making sure that the mayor-elect is successful in terms of delivering upon both his affordability agenda as well as his public safety agenda,” Jeffries (D-Brooklyn) said, when asked if he struck a possible deal with Mamdani, a DSA member.\n\nThe Queens assemblyman just last week urged his fellow NYC DSA comrades in a closed-door meeting not to back Brooklyn City Councilman Chi Ossé, who was seeking the group’s endorsement for his campaign against the top House Democrat.\n\nA key group within the DSA’s local chapter later narrowly voted against endorsing Ossé’s Dem primary challenge.\n\nA source told The Post that Mamdani’s camp had tried to get ahead of potential blowback from the minority leader by leaking a story about the mayor-elect attempting to dissuade Ossé from mounting the uphill primary challenge.\n\nA representative for Mamdani did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJeffries, meanwhile, was in his Eighth Congressional District Monday jumping on Mamdani’s key campaign issue of affordability with a press conference in Bedford-Stuyvesant about food insecurity. \n\nBut he said he hadn’t discussed with Mamdani the incoming mayor’s signature campaign promise to open city-run grocery stores, one in each borough, in an attempt to provide more affordable food and other goods to New Yorkers in need.\n\n“I look forward to having a conversation with him – we speak frequently – but look forward to having a conversation with him about that particular policy proposal,” he said, while specifically commending Mamdani’s focus on the overall affordability issue.\n\nThe moderate congressman — who waited until just days before the Nov. 4 election to offer a lukewarm endorsement for Mamdani as mayor — also didn’t directly answer when asked if he had any reservations about the proposed program.\n\n“I think that generally, Mayor-elect Mamdani has been strongly focused on the issue of affordability, but as he transitions from where he is not into the mayorship, it’s going to be important to figure out how at the city, state and federal level we can all align to make sure that we’re delivering on the policy things that he’s proposed,” he said.\n\nOssé has said that his primary campaign would attempt to win over voters by comparing federal military spending to defend Israel against investments in the district, The Post previously reported.\n\nWithout mentioning Ossé by name, Bed-Stuy Assemblywoman Stefani Zinerman told Jeffries at the event “nobody could do your job,” emphasizing the number of federal funds that have flowed to the district.\n\n“It is hard going to work every day to have to fight for people to have a moral code, the decency to just have resources – for people to have food on the table, a good job and healthcare to take care of their family,” she said.\n\nJeffries continued to praise Mamdani’s decision to retain Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch to lead the NYPD in his incoming administration. \n\n“I think that’s a great thing for the communities that I represent, a great thing for the city, and a great thing for his administration to get off to a fast start on public safety,” he said.",

        "text": "And she’s unlikely to be the only GOP lawmaker heading for the exit.\nAs Punchbowl News’ Jake Sherman reported Monday, several other House Republicans are considering leaving their post in the middle of the current term over frustrations with the Trump White House and Speaker Mike Johnson. “This entire White House team has treated ALL members like garbage,” a senior GOP member messaged Punchbowl. “And Mike Johnson has let it happen because he wanted it to happen.”\n“The arrogance of this White House team is off-putting to members who are run roughshod and threatened,” the member added, saying that Republican lawmakers have little hope of maintaining the House majority they held on to in 2024. They predicted more high-profile resignations, and that Johnson would lose his gavel. “Morale has never been lower.”\nIt’s a far cry from where Republicans were this time last year. In 2024 they were coming off a resounding electoral victory—they took the White House, retained control of the House of Representatives, and won back the Senate—and believed they had been given a “mandate” to radically remake America, as Trump claimed after defeating Kamala Harris. But they quickly abused that so-called mandate, with Trump authorizing Elon Musk to take a “chainsaw” to the federal government; forcing through his unpopular “big, beautiful bill”; and pursuing an aggressive tariff regime that has exacerbated the economic precarity he told voters he’d remedy. The public frustration with Trump has intensified further in recent months amid his administration’s brutal immigration crackdown, a historic shutdown, and his handling of the Epstein files—the latter of which was a catalyst for the rupture between Trump and Greene.\nCongress, meanwhile, has been “mostly sidelined,” as Greene lamented in a lengthy statement announcing her resignation, which will be effective January 5. Johnson has outsourced much of his chamber’s legislative duties to the White House, which is unilaterally pushing tariffs, conducting strikes on what it claims are drug boats in the Caribbean, and even replacing the East Wing with an ostentatious ballroom. The bulk of Johnson’s job, as he is currently performing it, appears to be standing in front of reporters and saying that he didn’t hear about the latest Trump scandal.\nThis year of chaos, cowardice, and corruption culminated in off year elections earlier this month that could foreshadow a 2026 blue wave. Democrats dominated in races across the country, including in high-profile contests in Virginia and New Jersey—where moderates Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill won gubernatorial elections—as well as in New York City, where democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani was elected to succeed Eric Adams as mayor. Even Trump acknowledged afterward, “I don’t think it was good for Republicans.”\nIt’s understandable why some Republicans might be frustrated with the position he and the sycophantic Johnson have put them in. But any lawmakers who are considering following Greene’s lead might want to look in the mirror before they leave the House and ask themselves what, exactly, they expected to happen when they cast their lot with Trump. In 2024, Democrats learned the hard way about the pitfalls of making opposition to Trump the core of their political identity. Perhaps Republicans, 10 years into this loathsome MAGA era, will finally be made to understand the danger of basing their entire political identity around supporting him.",

        "text": "In early October, RedState issued a warning about the critical need for local vetting of candidates before they run for higher office and potentially rise to positions of state and national prominence. \n\nCitizens must work to recognize and neutralize terrible candidates at the local level, before they have the chance to not just wreck a school board or a city, but a municipality, an entire state, and potentially, the nation. \n\nRead More: Des Moines School Board and VA AG Race Show Local Communities Must Vet Before Candidates Gain a Foothold\n\nFor New York City and Virginia, the die has been cast. Communist and Democrat Socialist Zohran Mamdani is now New York's mayor-elect. As for Virginia, they elected the sociopath Jay Jones, a Democrat legislator who ran for attorney general, even though text messages were exposed where he fantasized about violent deaths for his Republican colleague, his wife, and his children. This is a tragic commentary on not just voter standards, but the cavalier attitude toward violence that certain Americans have embraced — especially when the violence is directed toward people who hold views they don't like.\n\nAlso in early October, while the majority of politicos were obsessing over both these races and the New Jersey governorship, a school board in NJ's Monmouth County exposed what will now be known as \"The Jay Jones Effect.\" Marlboro Township School Board member Danielle Bellomo, a conservative and self-proclaimed supporter of President Donald Trump, was targeted by Scott Semaya, a liberal candidate for the board, with sexually-charged and violent threats over a text thread that allegedly involved the board vice president and the husband of one of its members.\n\nYou cannot make this stuff up. \n\nA New Jersey school board candidate was caught red-handed sending vicious, sexual messages about a conservative female board member in a group chat labeled “ThisBitchNeedsToDie.”Photos of Scott Semaya’s vile texts about Danielle Bellomo at a July school board meeting leaked this week on social media — and the widening scandal is now being investigated by local cops and roiling the affluent suburb of Marlboro.“Bellomo must be cold — her nips could cut glass right n” read one text, allegedly captured on camera while Semaya’s fingers typed an “o.”Outrage was immediate, and Semaya this week dropped out of the race for the Marlboro Board of Education, followed by his running mate Melissa Goldberg.The scandal in the leafy Monmouth County enclave has drawn parallels to the recent controversy in Virginia, where attorney general candidate Jay Jones was recently outed for a 2022 text message suggesting the state’s then-Republican House Speaker deserved to be shot in the head.“It was absolutely terrifying,” Bellomo exclusively told The Post. “When I found out about the messages I was absolutely shocked, especially with the climate of our country. It sent chills down my spine.\n\nIt should send chills down all our spines. This is a school board, where the education and concerns for the children of the community are supposed to trump any political leanings or personal animus. \n\nApparently not. \n\nSo, what evil has Bellomo done that has caused these hyperbolic and vicious attacks? She ran and won on a platform of curriculum transparency and parental rights, and she continues to stand for these things.\n\nBellomo has spent more than a decade volunteering in Marlboro Township schools. She says she ran for the board to support curriculum transparency and parental rights, not to become a target.\"I got involved in the school boards because I’m an active volunteer in our community. I’ve been involved with the parent organization that I account for going on 12 years,\" she said. \"So I saw the school board as the next step in furthering my involvement in the community and I wanted it to enhance my children’s educational experience while they were in the K-3 district. I never imagined that it would have led to this.\"\n\nYet Democrats and the left persist in downplaying this type of violent and charged rhetoric when it is directed toward conservatives and Republican candidates and officials. Even Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) commented on Bellomo's case, pointing out that the political violence seems to be weighted to one side and one side only.\n\nBut last week, Democrat electeds decided to create a video about the military having a constitutional duty to \"defy illegal orders\" from President Donald Trump, knowingly skating a line that could be classified as sedition. When the president called them out with a post that outlines what the price of sedition is, they cried about violence and hateful rhetoric. \n\nDive Deeper: Morning Minute: The Dems Released a Sedition-y Ad, and I Have Questions\n\nTo make a finer point: These types of dangerous individuals with flexible allegiances and violent fantasies are sitting in our U.S. Congress, trying to start a color revolution. How many of them started out as a city council person or on the school board? We need to start taking the vetting and ruling out of local candidates seriously. Many of these people should not be elected to dog catcher, let alone have public oversight over a school district, a city, or a county. Another illustration of this is playing out in Nashville with Democrat congressional candidate Aftyn Behn. She is being vetted and exposed ahead of a special election, and let us hope the citizens of Nashville are paying attention. Like this circumstance in New Jersey, these opportunistic and sociopathic characters must be exposed early and barred from any form of elected office. \n\nThe vicious chat group was believed to be composed of five men, and allegedly included Chad Hyett, current Marlboro school board vice president, according to a source. Many in the town of 41,000 are now calling for Hyett’s resignation.Semaya and Goldberg were running on a purportedly apolitical slate called Collaborators for Responsible Education, or CORE. The third candidate on the slate, longtime incumbent Michael Lilonsky, remains in the race. He did not return a message.Goldberg told New Jersey’s Patch.com she was abandoning her bid for the board because she “currently cannot commit to this role in addition to my other responsibilities.”\n\nUnlike Jay Jones, Semaya had some modicum of shame and stepped out of the race. But it only gets worse. Weeks after the egregious text thread was laid bare, Bellamo revealed in a school board meeting that board VP Chad Hyett had been harassing her for months over social media. One of the thoughts Hyett shared about Bellomo was that she is \"a real piece of work and a stain on our board.\"\n\nThe Marlboro BOE meeting last week was straight-up chaotic—and heartbreaking. Board member Danielle Bellomo bravely shared how Vice President Chad Hyett relentlessly harassed and trashed her on social media before the vile group chat surfaced, where he and others plotted her death ('ThisBitchNeedsToDie'). He refuses to step down from the Board of Education as the vice president.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, Bellomo filed a temporary protective order against one person who is alleged to be part of the text chain: Mitesh Gandhi, whose wife happens to be a board member. \n\nA Monmouth County judge this week extended a temporary protective order against Mitesh Gandhi, the husband of another school board member, after reading aloud a series of text messages allegedly written by him. The messages included a group chat titled, \"This B---- Needs to Die.\"In one of the text threads, Gandhi allegedly referred to Bellomo as \"a lying c---\" and wrote, \"Mission is to just let her die by herself lol.\"\n\nFox Digital reported that a judge extended that temporary protective order through January 2026.\n\nThe judge overseeing the protective-order hearing refused to dismiss Gandhi’s request to end the order, allowing Bellomo’s protective order to continue through January, when a full trial will be held. Under New Jersey law, a harassment-related protective order can be extended if a judge finds an ongoing risk to the petitioner.\n\nDespite the Marlboro Township Police Department recommending criminal charges, the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office has declined to do so. But Bellomo's disappointment is extended toward the Township district and board president's handling of the situation.\n\nBellomo says the most painful part has been the response, or lack thereof, from her own school district. One of the text threads, she claims, was sent during an in-person board meeting while she sat just feet away.\"Our township has policies. If someone is a threat, they’re not supposed to be allowed on school property,\" she said. \"Our superintendent, Dr. Michael Ballone, did nothing. Our board president, Brian Cohen, did nothing. They chose not to implement the policies that are already in place.\"\n\nBellomo also points out that this situation has produced a chilling effect. Upstanding citizens who should be running for public office are too afraid to do it because of the ugliness perpetrated by these men.\n\nBellomo says she has already heard from dozens of women who say her situation has scared them away from public service.\"They say, ‘I could never go through what you’re going through,’\" she said. \"That’s heartbreaking. Local government should not require you to put your family at risk.\"\n\nLocal government should not require that citizens resign themselves to being led by unconscientious and insane people. We must confront and deny them, and encourage brave individuals like Danielle Bellomo to step into the fray. Otherwise, we will continue to foster the Jay Jones Effect and see our nation rot from the inside out. \n\nAbraham Lincoln said it well:\n\nWe the people are the rightful masters of both Congress and the courts, not to overthrow the Constitution but to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution. \n\nEditor's Note: President Trump is fighting to dismantle the Department of Education and ensure America's kids get the education they deserve.\n\nHelp us fight back against Big Government waste and restore power back to the states.

        "text": "Radio host Charlamagne tha God said on Monday he doesn’t want to hear politicians recklessly accuse each other of fascism or communism anymore after the friendly meeting between President Donald Trump and NYC mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. The assassination attempts on Trump's life and the murder of TPUSA co-founder Charlie Kirk have sparked a national conversation about whether accusing one’s political opponent of extremism is contributing to a dangerous political environment. The friendly meeting between the two elected leaders made headlines for being surprisingly chummy after months of wary rhetoric from both. In one viral moment, Trump gracefully shrugged off a reporter asking Mamdani about his past comments of Trump being a fascist, saying he doesn’t care. Charlamagne argued in the \"Donkey of the Day\" segment of Monday’s episode of the \"Breakfast Club\" that the Trump-Mamdani meeting proved such accusations are overused and hypocritical. CHARLAMAGNE TELLS VAN JONES TO 'SHUT THE F UP FOREVER' AFTER CALLING MAMDANI’S VICTORY SPEECH DIVISIVE \"I don't want to hear any politicians call each other ‘fascists,’ ‘authoritarians,’ ‘wannabe dictators,’ ‘communists,’ none of that kind of rhetoric anymore. It's all dead. Because if you call someone that, and then turn around and say, ‘But I'm willing to work with them,’ it looks hypocritical,\" he said. Charlamagne also reacted to Mamdani’s interview on the following Sunday, when he told NBC host Kristen Welker on \"Meet the Press\" that he still believes Trump is a fascist, but even so, was willing to work with him. \"So, if Zohran truly believes Trump is a fascist, then working with him makes zero sense, but this is my issue. He doesn't fully believe Trump is a fascist, just like Trump doesn't fully believe Mamdani is a communist. It's all political theater,\" Charlamagne said. Charlamagne argued that while such rhetoric is irresponsible on its own, it leaves the voters divided. \"You know who it hurts the most? Us!\" Charlamagne said. \"You done told your aunt and three of your cousins, ‘F you, you [are] not invited to Thanksgiving this year’ because of who they supported politically. Meanwhile, the people we supported politically are willing to support each other. If Zohran and Trump can be in the White House smiling at each other and excessively touching on each other, then you and your family can enjoy Thanksgiving dinner together. Okay?\" ZOHRAN MAMDANI SAYS HE WILL DISCOURAGE 'GLOBALIZE THE INTIFADA' PHRASE He warned, \"Listen, to all elected officials, if you call somebody a ‘fascist’ or ‘communist,’ but then sit down and work with them like everything is normal, you make those words meaningless. Alright? It's dangerous to do that. It's dangerous to weaken those terms, and it confuses the public!\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",

        "text": "President Trump believes he has the upper hand in his budding relationship with Zohran Mamdani, according to a source who helped arrange last week’s bizarre lovefest at the Oval Office – and if you want to know why, just follow the money.\n\nTrump on Friday startled voters and pundits alike as he lauded New York City’s mayor-elect as a “rational person,” who “has a chance to really do something great for New York.” Previously, Trump branded Mamdani a “100 percent communist lunatic,” ripping his stance on taxes, the police and Israel and his refusal to condemn the phrase “globalize the Intifada.” \n\nLikewise, Mamdani, who has referred to Trump as a “fascist” and a “despot,” gushed about the duo’s “shared purpose.”\n\nTo make sense of the surreal spectacle, it’s helpful to know that behind the scenes, the meeting was brokered by a New York business titan close to Trump who believes the president should play the long game with the lefty Mamdani for the good of the city and for his own agenda – particularly as it relates to deportations, The Post has learned. \n\nIt’s also helpful to know that this was after said businessman was approached by a top official in Mamdani’s inner circle. \n\nThe surprise message from Mamdani’s transition team: The mayor-elect – who in his election-night speech had dared Trump to “turn the volume up” – would now like to smooth things over with Trump. \n\nThe Mamdani official indicated the newly elected mayor knows he needs help from the White House to pay for even a few of his vast spending promises and to balance the city budget as he must by law, say people with direct knowledge of the matter. \n\nThat, according to sources, was after Mamdani – a 34-year-old backbench assemblyman and former rapper – was briefed on the $7.5 billion in federal aid the city receives each year. That cash, sources noted, is crucial for his socialist agenda – and could be throttled by the president. \n\n“He faces a $17 billion budget deficit in the next fiscal year to pay for all the free stuff he’s proposing,” said the city business leader who helped organize the event and advised Trump to take the meeting. “Even if (Gov. Kathy) Hochul agrees to raise taxes, he still faces a multibillion-dollar shortfall. He needs Trump and Trump knows it.”\n\n“Trump is playing nice for now,” this person added. “But if Mamdani doesn’t allow deportations, or defunds the police or goes full on communist, Trump is ready to lower the hammer.”\n\nA White House press rep had no immediate comment. A spokesman for Mamdani also had no comment.\n\nTrump holds the upper hand, among other things, because the mayor faces a requirement under state law to balance the budget. Accordingly, the business leader advised the president that he has nothing to lose by offering an olive branch – even if it’s to an avowed socialist with far left cultural views. \n\nIn the weeks and months ahead, however, don’t count on uninterrupted warm and fuzzies. Trump continues to view Mamdani with extreme skepticism. The mayor will only get the money if he tempers his socialist economic and cultural agenda in the city where the president’s real estate empire still has a major footprint.\n\nOver the weekend, Mamdani on a Sunday talk show refused to disavow his past name calling of Trump as a “fascist” and a “despot.”\n\nOnly a few days earlier ahead of the meeting, Mamdani is said to have agreed not to antagonize Trump at the powwow and to keep the conversation on how best to fix the city’s affordability issues. \n\n“What I really appreciate about the president is the meeting that we had focused not on places of disagreement, which there are many, but also focused on the shared purpose that we have in serving New Yorkers,” Mamdani said of Trump in keeping his promise. \n\nIn the next fiscal year, New York City faces a budget shortfall of as much as $8 billion. When accounting for Mamdani’s plans for free buses, massive new spending on housing, plus items like subsidizing trans care for children, the deficit widens to as much as $17 billion, according to some estimates.\n\nMamdani is calling for higher taxes on individuals who make $1 million and a vast increase on the corporate tax rates. Both have to be approved by Gov. Hochul and the state legislature.\n\nHochul has been warming up to Mamdani’s plans, but he must finish the year without a deficit, and raising taxes could force more of the so-called 1% to keep moving out of the state as they have been for the past decade.\n\nAll of that could make Mamdani more beholden to Trump and his policy goals. Some say it’s already happening, pointing to Mamdani’s plans to re-appoint the tough-on-crime NYPD commissioner Jessica Tisch. Ditto for Mamdani’s recent support for the re-election of House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) over a DSA-endorsed challenger. \n\n“Trump is not worried about Mamdani,” said another city business leader. “He has a ‘plan B’ if Mamdani misbehaves.”",

        "text": "At that time, Edwards said, inflation was generally being blamed on raw material prices because of the Ukraine war, as well as the labor market, with very few people saying there was profit-driven inflation, but he took a different view: “This is unprecedented,” he noted, pointing out, “when unit costs rise, always, unit margins fall, always, in history.” He said that shouldn’t have happened, and the reason it did was because of so much stimulus from the government that “companies could get away with doing it, using [inflation as] cover.”\n\nThe consequence of this money printing and fiscal expenditure was a “bonanza for the corporate sector,” resulting in corporate profit margins soaring “off to infinity” after the pandemic. Edwards noted specific sectors benefited enormously, recalling a St. Louis Fed study that showed corporate profits as a share of national income surging since the inflation spike, a total outlier compared with the rest of the world.\n\nThis period of corporate excess laid the groundwork for severe political instability and public outrage, Edwards argued. Just look at the election in New York, he said, which was all about the cost of living. Zohran Mamdani’s election is “an indication that this still is a big issue.” Edwards agreed “affordability” is a major topic of the moment, along with the U.S. housing market: “It stands out as, like, ‘What’s going on?’”\n\nThis latest twist in the populist turn isn’t necessarily something to celebrate, Edwards said. As an economist, he said he considers Mamdani’s policies, deriving from his democratic socialist background, such as rent control and price controls, to be “lunacy,” having experienced them himself in the 1970s. Still, dysfunction in capitalism means that society will “come back full circle to this.” The increasing intergenerational strife, driven by young people being shut out of the housing market and out of wealth concentration, has created a primal sense of betrayal, especially among Americans who no longer feel they are better off than their parents.\n\nEdwards was speaking as the first-time homebuyer hit an average age of 40 years old, a stark symbol of how the largely youthful voter base that elected Mamdani is shut out of the market. Sean Dobson, CEO of the Amherst Group, one of America’s largest institutional landlords, recently estimated the same post-COVID economic landscape that so outraged Edwards meant “we’ve probably made housing unaffordable for a whole generation of Americans.”\n\n‘You reap what you sow’\n\nComing back to his critique of capitalism, Edwards argued Mamdani’s election is “part of the consequence … The corporates, by being excessively greedy, hence ‘greedflation,’ have laid the seeds for their own destruction—and backlash.” Edwards added that “more and more people are identifying corporate excess.”\n\nSpeaking about what he called “intergenerational strife,” Edwards said he thinks this is “the first generation where people are not seeing themselves as better off than their parents were.” Everywhere you look in modern capitalism, “young people can’t get on the housing ladder, they see wealth extremely concentrated … It takes the incentivization out of the economy if young people don’t feel they’re participating.”\n\nEdwards’s argument here has some strange bedfellows, as none other than Peter Thiel has been warning about this incentivization problem for years. Mamdani’s election seemed to send a shiver through Silicon Valley’s right-wing contingent, as Chamath Palihapitiya shared Peter Thiel’s 2020 email to Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Andreessen, warning of a “broken generational compact” and reasoning, “if one has no stake in the capitalist system, then one may well turn against it.” In a follow-up interview days later, Thiel told The Free Press, “if you proletarianize the young people, you shouldn’t be surprised if they eventually become communist.”\n\nOn the left wing of legal thought, Columbia Law School professor Tim Wu recently told Fortune that he wrote his new book, The Age of Extraction, about a similar feeling. “My understanding of America is that it’s the place where things are supposed to get better,” Wu said, but instead we’re living through a time with “an economy-wide problem” where “everything kind of just creeps. It’s that weird feeling of something you like becoming worse.” He added that American politics right now are “very angry” and marked by “economic resentment” but also a general feeling that “we let things go a little too far” and we “just kind of lost touch with the tradition of broad-based wealth that was the American way.”\n\nOn the subject of greedflation, Edwards was philosophical but insisted that what happened in 2023 was a mistake. “Okay, I can understand this is capitalism, this is how it works,” he said about pursuit of the profit motive, “but if the government doesn’t step in” then a backlash is bound to happen. Edwards declined to say whether this was a particularly Democratic or Republican issue, but, he noted, “there’s a reluctance” in American culture to dictate to the corporate sector. At any rate, the consequence of it is “there’s a day of reckoning coming in,” he said.\n\nEdwards, who is also convinced artificial intelligence is in a bubble, said he views his role in this often overly optimistic market as similar to “Caesar’s slave,” referring to the story from antiquity about the Roman emperor ordering someone to follow him around and always whisper in one ear: “You are mortal.” (This is also commonly referred to by the Latin phrase “memento mori.”) Edwards warns while the macro-level excesses might not be visible in aggregate, drilling down reveals “things are pretty crappy under the surface.” The political reaction embodied by Mamdani’s focus on affordability is a clear sign that the economic consequences of corporate greed are now driving mainstream political change. \n\nEdwards concluded there’s a fitting phrase for the dysfunctions of capitalism in the 2020s: “You reap what you sow.”",

        "text": "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt broke her silence on New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. Leavitt was asked about Mamdani’s ‘fascist’ label for Donald Trump, and she replied, “I think talk is cheap… and I think the President is going to judge Mamdani by his actions that he takes in New York.”\n\nKaroline Leavitt went on to describe the Trump-Mamdani meeting as “positive” and continued, “The meeting was positive as you heard from the President last week and I think the fact that the President is willing to meet with somebody who said those types of things about him shows that he really is interested in being a President for all Americans regardless of where they live or who their leader is.”\n\nIn her response to the reporter, Karoline Leavitt spoke about Trump’s long association with New York and said, “He wants what’s best for New York. He loves New York City. He helped build the skyline. He spent his whole life there and so he really wants to see New York do well. So, that’s how that meeting played last week.”\n\n.@PressSec on NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani: “Talk is cheap… The fact that @POTUS is willing to meet with somebody who said those types of things about him shows that he really is interested in being a President for ALL Americans.” pic.twitter.com/uA6pDjde36\n— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) November 24, 2025\n\nDuring their Oval Office meeting last week, Mamdani was asked by a reporter stationed there, “Just days ago, you referred to Trump as a ‘despot’ and accused him of having a fascist agenda. Are you planning to retract any of these remarks?”\n\nDuring the meeting, Trump said that it was ok for Mamdani to refer to the President as a ‘despot.’ Mamdani straight up told the reporter, “We are both very clear on our positions and our views, and what I really appreciate about the president is our meeting focused not on places of disagreement but the shared purpose we have.” In addition to Mamdani’s answer, Trump responded, “I’ve been called much worse than a despot.\n\n.@POTUS on Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani: “He’s got views that are a little out there, but who knows. We’re going to see what works.” pic.twitter.com/5qBVFKDLxm\n— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) November 21, 2025\n\nAfter the meeting, both Trump and Mamdani seemed to have taken a U-turn from their original views about each other. The President claimed that the meeting actually “surprised” him. He wants to see no crime. He wants to see housing being built. He wants to see rents coming down. All things that I agree with,” Trump said.\n\nHe added, “I expect to be helping him, not hurting him — a big help, because I want New York City to be great. I think he wants to make it greater than ever before and if he can, we’ll be out there cheering. I’ll be cheering for him.”\n\nMeanwhile, here’s what Mamdani said about Trump after the Oval Office meeting on Friday, “I appreciated the time with the president. I appreciated your conversation. We are very clear about our positions and our views, and what I really appreciate about the president is the meeting that we had focused not on places of disagreement, of which there are many, but instead focused on the shared purpose that we have in serving New Yorkers.”\n\nTrump and Mamdani’s equation can be labeled as somewhat complicated. The two publicly challenged each other on several occasions. During his victory speech in New York earlier this month, Mamdani, openly challenging Trump, said, “Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up.”\n\nBefore the exchange of heated words, Trump claimed in an interaction with the media that he’s “much better-looking” than Mamdani. To which, the democratic socialist replied, “My focus is on the cost-of-living crisis, bro.”",

        "text": "Zohran Mamdani reaffirmed on national television that he still considers US President Donald Trump a 'fascist', just days after what appeared to be a surprisingly friendly Oval Office meeting.\n\nIn a Meet the Press interview aired on 23 November 2025, the New York City mayor-elect flatly stated, 'Everything that I've said in the past, I continue to believe'.\n\nUnlikely Cordiality in the Oval Office\n\nOn 21 November 2025, Mamdani and Trump met in the White House for a 45-minute session. The tone was unexpectedly warm, given their prior political animosity.\n\nDuring a press-conference-style exchange, a reporter asked Mamdani if he still characterised Trump as a 'fascist'. Trump, who has frequently clashed with Mamdani, intervened. 'That's OK. You can just say yes ... It's easier than explaining', he said, patting Mamdani on the arm.\n\nMamdani smiled and said, 'Yes'.\n\nReaffirming the Critique — With Purpose\n\nIn the television interview, Mamdani made clear he had not softened his critique. He said that working with Trump did not mean abandoning his previous assessments. 'That's something that I've said in the past. I say it today', he told NBC's Kristen Welker.\n\nHe framed his willingness to cooperate not as a betrayal, but as an act of responsibility. 'I think working for the people of New York City demands that you work with everyone and anyone — and that you always look to find those areas of agreement while not overlooking the places of disagreement,' he said.\n\nMamdani also emphasised that his trip to the White House was not a symbolic gesture. He told Welker, 'I'm coming in there to deliver for New Yorkers', pointing to the central issues on his agenda: housing, childcare, groceries, utilities.\n\nFar from retaliating, Trump struck a conciliatory tone during the meeting. He defended Mamdani from adversarial questions, calling him 'a very rational person'.\n\nHe also expressed optimism about Mamdani's ability to govern, saying, 'We agree on a lot more than I would have thought ... I want him to do a great job'.\n\nAt one point, when Mamdani mentioned his cost-of-living concerns for New Yorkers, Trump publicly signalled his support. 'We are going to be helping him ... having a strong and very safe New York', he said.\n\nA Strategic Meeting With Sharp Undercurrents\n\nObservers have described the meeting as politically calculated. On the surface, it was a spectacle, long-feuding figures sharing smiles, shaking hands. But under that veneer lies something more transactional. Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, and Trump, the Republican President, found common ground on affordability.\n\nMamdani noted that when he asked his constituents, including Trump voters, why they supported him, they consistently raised cost-of-living as their top issue. In their meeting, he said, this theme came 'back again and again', messaging that may resonate beyond their ideological divide.\n\nBy reasserting his 'fascist' label, Mamdani underscores a larger political point. Ideological disagreements do not preclude governance. He insists that his deep-rooted critique of Trump's style and policies remains intact, even as he negotiates with him.\n\nHis remarks also reflect a broader anxiety on the left about the erosion of democratic norms. Mamdani's use of 'despot' and 'fascist' is not idle insults, they serve as warnings. He has argued, repeatedly, that his election is not simply about policy, but about resisting authoritarian tendencies.\n\nIn a moment of political theatre, Mamdani and Trump found cordiality; yet the ideological chasm remains gaping, and Mamdani is unrepentant.\n\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK",

        "text": "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins declared on Monday during an interview about affordability that the American dream is making a comeback under the Trump administration and \"real relief\" was coming \"very soon.\" \"But as we’re restructuring the entire economy, as we’re bringing down inflation, bringing down fuel, bringing down labor, Americans, we believe, will see real relief very, very soon. Those numbers are already down, but much more to come,\" she told CNBC. \"This administration has been incredibly focused on getting the American dream back into every American’s home and goals, et cetera. And affordability is a huge piece of that. Of course, I’m the agriculture secretary. So food, food production, supporting our farmers and ranchers is a big piece,\" she said. Affordability has been a dominant political topic in 2025, with Democrats like Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race successfully touting addressing price concerns on the campaign trail. President Donald Trump was elected in 2024 in part on frustration with inflation and affordability under the Biden administration, but new polls show impatience with his economic stewardship. TRUMP GROWS FRUSTRATED WITH GOP FOR NOT TOUTING HIS ‘GREATEST ECONOMY IN HISTORY’ Rollins said that the previous administration was a different story. \"And when you look at under Joe Biden the last four years, we had an increase in inputs, interest rates, 73%, fertilizer, 36%, labor increased 47%… No new trade deals during those four years, no way to move the food out,\" she said. \"So when you look at all of that in total, it’s no surprise that what we inherited was an absolute economic mess. But those numbers are coming down.\" She added that nonetheless, \"There are a few outliers. And you mentioned Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent talked about a couple of those yesterday. We’re working on those extremely diligently.\" In response to the trajectory of Trump's tariff agenda, Rollins explained that she has been at Trump’s side for a long time and has seen measurable results. \"His vision of realigning the entire world economy around putting American products first and America first, but also using tariffs as a really important economic tool to make sure that we are doing everything we can for our country and to keep our country at the top of the world,\" she said. \"But what the president did was using these as economic tools, but also important foreign policy tools as well.\" WHEN DID MAGA BECOME MAKE ARGENTINA GREAT AGAIN? She juxtaposed the Trump administration with the preceding Biden administration again, noting the variety of new trade deals that have emerged. \"What the president did with liberation day, with enacting all these tariffs back in February. We now have dozens of new trade deals, and within Indonesia, Australia, Japan, EU, England, it’s just remarkable. And a lot of these deals people tried for 20, 25 years to get these deals again. Under the last administration, we didn’t have one new trade deal. We went from an agriculture trade surplus under Trump to a deficit, $50 billion deficit in just agriculture,\" she said. \"So think about the effects on our farmers and ranchers. $50 billion is a significant amount when you’re growing corn or soybeans or apples or whatever you’re growing. So being able to solve for that, which now we’re doing again, it’s incredible.\" American farmers, she said, have been Trump’s priority since the beginning of his initial campaign and will be receiving forthcoming aid.

        "text": "Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, a Republican whose county neighbors New York City, said that he is directing authorities to install cameras and security technology along the border with the city in light of the election of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. In an interview with Fox News Digital, Blakeman, who was just re-elected earlier this month to serve a second term in the majority blue county, said he will be taking extra precautions to preserve law and order in Nassau County in light of the socialist mayor-elect, Mamdani. \"We are doing everything necessary to make sure that Nassau County is safe,\" he said. \"We are installing technology along the border of New York City that will read license plates, that will have facial recognition, that will have video cameras.\" He also stated that the county is hiring new police officers in addition to its existing force and the 100 police cadets currently enrolled in the Nassau County Police Academy. NYC SUBURB OFFICIAL REVEALS HOW ICE PARTNERSHIP HAS FLIPPED SCRIPT ON CRIME AS MAMDANI VICTORY LOOMS \"Our cops are doing a great job, and I'm going to continue to give them the personnel and the resources, technology and equipment and training that will now allow them to combat any situation that would jeopardize the security and safety of our communities here in Nassau County,\" he said. Meanwhile, Blakeman said Mamdani \"talks like he's pro-criminal, not pro-victim.\" While Republicans in Virginia, New Jersey and New York suffered electoral defeats earlier this month, Blakeman won his race by close to 12 percentage points. He beat out a Democrat in a county with over 100,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans. He attributes this victory to leaning into his messages on improving public safety and affordability, which he said resonates with all demographics. He did not even shy away from his condemnation of New York sanctuary policies and the county’s partnership with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. NEW YORK LEADER PLEDGES MORE COPS, TOUGHER ICE PARTNERSHIP IF NYC ELECTS SOCIALIST MAYOR \"New York State was an area that was safe, and I think basically that's what the people are craving,\" he explained. \"I never ran away from my pro-Trump policies. I supported the president, and I continue to support the president. People respected me for that, even if they disagree, because they knew that I wasn't a phony. And yet, at the same time, what I was doing on parallel tracks is reaching out to the communities … and let them know that I am a county executive for all people, so I'm going to continue to make their neighborhoods safer. I'm going to keep taxes down.\" \"Our campaign appealed to the independent voters and crossover Democrats,\" he explained. \"That's why I think we were a bright star on an otherwise dark night on election night.\" This law-and-order message stands in stark contrast with Mamdani’s history of comments calling the police racist, anti-queer and a public safety threat. Though Mamdani walked back those statements during his campaign, his proposal to replace law enforcement officers with mental health workers has raised concerns about a further deepening of crime in New York City. MAMDANI TAKES AIM AT TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POLICIES IN FIERY STATEN ISLAND SPEECH: 'WE ARE FIGHTING TO KEEP NYC A SANCTUARY CITY' While New York swings to the left, Blakeman said his approach counters the momentum around Mamdani’s socialist policy proposals. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP \"Right now, I see his values as anti-American,\" he said. \"So, I have a lot of issues with Mamdani.\" \"We built the greatest economic city in the world, with the financial capital of the world being in New York City.

        "text": "Few would disagree with the notion that President Donald Trump is rather malleable on issues of policy and political alliances. Friends and enemies swap places with surprising regularity. Must-pass initiatives become rejected agendas just as quickly.\n\nAs visual evidence of this, consider two scenes.\n\nBack in February 2025, the president hosted a chummy joint press conference in the Oval Office with the world's richest man, Elon Musk, who outlined his plans to slash the federal government to the bone via his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nThen, just last week, Trump hosted another amicable joint press conference where his guest was the self-described socialist mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani, who plans on making New York City great again with tax hikes on billionaires like Musk to fund billions in new social spending.\n\nThe president was rather unembarrassed when pressed by reporters on his willingness to host someone whom he described as a dangerous communist just a few weeks ago.\n\n\"We all change. I changed a lot, changed a lot from when I first came to office,\" said Trump at last week's press conference.\n\nWhile DOGE did not come up in the president's press conference with Mamdani, their friendly Q&A helps to bookend the sunsetting of his administration's signature state-slashing initiative.\n\nReuters reported yesterday that DOGE no longer exists. Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor told the news outlet that the agency has been disbanded as a standalone entity. Former DOGE staffers have been transferred to another executive initiative tasked with beautifying government websites.\n\nThe DOGE effort to dismantle, reform, and streamline the entire federal government started with such a bang. It's now sunsetting with barely a whimper.\n\nNumerous retrospectives on DOGE's success have been written since Musk, the animating force behind the initiative, left the White House on less-than-amicable terms several months ago.\n\nIts official closure provides another opportunity to assess what, if any, success it had, and whether (as the Mamdani press conference might indicate) we've fully transitioned into a new phase of this second Trump administration: one interested in growing government, instead of shrinking it.\n\nGiven its quiet slide into irrelevance, it's important to remember that DOGE began as the signature initiative of the Trump White House. Its ambitious remit included closing the federal deficit, eliminating whole departments, zeroing out unauthorized regulation, and upgrading the federal government's \"tech stack.\"\n\nAs I detail in the latest issue of Reason, DOGE mostly failed at these goals.\n\nThe most glaring disparity between promises and reality was DOGE's impact on federal spending. Musk's agency went from promising potentially trillions in spending cuts to claiming hundreds of billions in savings from canceled grants and contracts.\n\nAlmost all of those cuts proved illusory. What we were left with was a small $9 billion rescission package codifying cuts to foreign aid and public broadcasting. The federal government is on track to spend more, not less, during Trump's second term.\n\nHigh hopes that DOGE would completely remake the federal government's I.T. infrastructure have also come to naught.\n\nThe Trump administration's record on deregulation is salutary. More regulatory costs are being eliminated than added, although this elimination of red tape has generally come from agencies themselves rather than DOGE specifically.\n\nThe one area where DOGE has arguably fulfilled its mission is in reducing federal headcount. While the government shutdown and consequent delay in federal jobs reporting obscure DOGE's full impact, the estimates we do have indicate a sizable drop in federal employment.\n\nThe Partnership for Public Service estimates that 211,000 civil servants (close to 10 percent of the entire federal workforce) have left federal employment via the Trump administration's workforce reduction plans.\n\nThat count includes workers let go during the shutdown, many of whom are likely to get their jobs back as a result of language included in the continuing resolution that reopened the government.\n\nYour mileage may vary on how laudatory you find his record of government cost cutting. My colleague Eric Boehm provided the \"glass half empty\" take here, which is well worth reading.\n\nI confess to looking more positively on DOGE's record. Not because I dispute any of the underlying numbers about its relatively minor impact on government operations. Rather, it's because it outperformed any expectations I had about the Trump administration's interest in cutting government at all.\n\nLibertarian Party convention speeches notwithstanding, Trump has never pitched himself as a small government champion. His record during his second term has made this abundantly clear.\n\nAs Reason's new issue on \"Republican socialism\" details, his administration is increasingly embracing big government across the board.\n\nThat includes policies one might expect from a Republican administration, like masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. It also includes any number of big government initiatives that the pre-Trump Republican party of recent memory would at least be embarrassed about—from tariffs to the government taking equity stakes in private companies.\n\nThe libertarian moment, this is not.\n\nFollowing the press conference with Mamdani, we can't even rely on Trump's reflexive anti-leftism to keep some of his administration's interfering tentacles at bay.\n\nThe socialists of all parties are finding out they actually agree on a lot.\n\nGiven the increasingly dark and interventionist trajectory of the Trump administration, it's hard not to have a little bit of nostalgia for the ever-so-brief DOGE era.\n\nFor a few short months, the White House's primary focus was on what spending could be cut and which federal workers could more productively serve their country in the private sector.\n\nIncompetent and slapdash as this effort was, it was at least stumbling in a more libertarian direction. Here was some evidence that anti-statism still had some role to play in the broader MAGA movement.\n\nWith the shuttering of DOGE now official, this transient and incomplete experiment in small government populism is definitively over. The high-water mark of what libertarians could hope for from the Trump administration has passed.\n\nPeople aren't wrong to bemoan DOGE's failures. I, for one, am still sad that it's gone. It's passing portends an even more authoritarian turn in our national politics.",

Two of the committees are unique to the Mamdani administration: the Worker Justice and Community Organizing committees.\n\n“These two committees illustrate the administration’s commitment to honoring and building upon the movement of working class New Yorkers that delivered the Mayor-elect’s historic victory,” a Mamdani transition release said.\n\nThe latter committee includes DSA member Asher Ross. Two other named DSA members, Katherine Jin and Julie Swoope, will be on the technology committee. Sebastian Leon Martinez of the Young Democratic Socialists of America will be on the Youth and Education committee.\n\nTransition Executive Director Elana Leopold said in a statement, “Excellence is the guiding light driving this transition, and today’s committee appointees are no exception.

Former Mayor Bill de Blasio and current Mayor Eric Adams did not have any NYC DSA leadership appointees in their transitions.\n\nMausser said last month that she does not expect to be in lockstep with Mamdani’s administration, though she will now take part in shaping it. \n\n“Of course, there will be instances where we disagree. Zohran’s administration is not the same as NYC DSA. We know that,” she told Politico. “We really want to put our energy into what we can build together with the power of a mayoral administration and the power of not only DSA but of a broad left-labor coalition.

        "text": "One of the more curious aspects within our present system of identity politics is the assumption that a person is in agreement with all of those with whom they share demographic likeness. Someone who is Muslim and also against Donald Trump, while also spouting the hope of equality and fairness for “the people” should be my cup of tea, right? Wrong.\n\nA cornerstone of democratic socialism, I suppose is the resting face of self-righteousness needled throughout any collective reallocation of wealth when it is based upon human similarity. To be sure, New York continuing to be New York is at least one of the few warm comforts left remaining to our United States. Since its inception, this city’s ethos (even when it was “Old” York in merry old England) has remained consistent: “these inhabitants are well-fit to be our servants, and they too comfortably and sit on a wealth that should be ours.” What were once the Scots to the Yorkers and Lenape to the Colonists, now we have New Yorkers to the invading throng of immigrants.\n\nOf course, of course. This nation has been built with the sweat and blood of immigrants, and New York itself has never been more than just a pinnacle of greed infecting one group after the next. Maybe the issue is the democratic socialism rhetoric bubbling up during a time of pre-imperial Trumpism? Take something’s name and separate it from its function, and you are left with a roomful of worried lobbyists. After you sort through those who are there simply for their cut, a tired, lonely mass of perpetual optimists are all that remain.\n\nDon’t blame them though. What has led to the rise of democratic socialism on the far left wing of American nonsense is partly due to the equally foul aroma of “Trump was right about everything” on the far right. As a spectator, today’s political melodrama is better than professional wrestling. However, as a citizen and a father, the continuing disagreement within our levels of governmental systems has me reaching for the history books.\n\nIf recent events have told us anything, it is that one must not put too much stock in the words uttered by an elitist speaking on behalf of the people. Though we have two seemingly different people in Zohran Mamdani and Trump, when we peel back their particular branch of used-car salesmanship, we are left with two people who lived in the half of New York reserved for the privileged. This is maybe why I still keep up with politics. It is as if the common people forget the broken promises and outright lies of our elite overlords every time one of them puts on a suit and asks us to “hope.” Though, as an epicurean and a cook, Mamdani’s election may be exactly what Greenfield needs.\n\nYears ago, a man got me into the habit of smoking cigars. Though I didn’t keep up with it, one little morsel of potential fact-hood this man left me was the events which followed Castro’s rise to power in Cuba. In short, I was told that the most talented cigar makers actually left for the Dominican Republic, and it is there that the skill of cigar-making actually continued to flourish. Perhaps this was not true, though something similar was described to me after the rise of Mao in China. Though this time dealing with martial arts, I have been advised by at least one of my Kung Fu teachers that many of the skilled practitioners fled to Taiwan after China became “Red China.” As historians and academics could debate ad infinitum as to the facts and possible realities which led to these emigrations, we have, at least, reflections of the human mind which refuses to be set to standard.\n\nWhen anything is “socialized,” it is made readily available and achievable by the meaty part of the bell curve. The drive for human excellence refuses the yoke of generality. If it didn’t, then why do the elite among us stock their refrigerators with grass-fed, raw cheddar and not with state-issued government cheese? This, my friends, is why I celebrate the election of Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York City. If this man is successful with his intended socialist policies, the world’s greatest bakers, chefs, and baristas are poised to flee to locales which have not enslaved them with regulation and mandate. I ask that the Greenfield City Council invite these future émigrés to our lovely city, if only to improve the flavor.\n\nAhmad Esfahani lives in Greenfield.",

I’m touching you. . . until the touched kid explodes. . . so the toucher can then say, look, he’s hitting me!\n\nAnd they certainly succeeded in pissing-off the president enough for Mr. Trump to suggest they could be hanged for their little prank — though he was probably incorrect about the legal niceties therein.\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe in a pensive moment\n\nThat members of the out-party in Congress and the Senate must resort to this kind of skylarking japery tells you how desperate they are. \n\nThe organizer, Minnesota Senator Elissa Slotkin, is a former CIA officer. Is she in communication regularly with any of her former colleagues at the Agency? And did she coordinate any part of her prank with them? I bet DNI Tulsi Gabbard could find out and let CIA Director John Ratcliffe know so he can fire their ass.\n\nThe intel bureaucracy remains a hotbed of resistance to the swamp-draining project underway since 01/20/25. The swamp creatures like their swamp fecund and fetid as it has been, with the rich revenue stream it is used to feeding on, and Mr. Trump has done much to change that. Alas, the CIA remains the most implacably opaque major operation in government. It insists that its activities require secrecy, and the awful downside is that the Agency has run without real oversight since its inception after the Second World War. Gawd knows how many John Brennan clones are still lodged over in the Langley, VA, HQ.\n\nOf all the celebrated new appointees in the agencies, Mr. Ratcliffe has been the least visible.\n\nHe went into the job with very promising credentials, having served as DNI in the last months of Trump 1.0. He must know where a whole lot of bodies are buried (some of them actual bodies) but the public has heard squat from him all year.\n\nSurely Mr. Ratcliffe must also know by now who in the CIA was scheming along with John Brennan to perpetrate RussiaGate, and who was on the leak-line to the news media. He must know how Adam Schiff coordinated impeachment No. 1 with CIA agent Eric Ciaramella, then Intel Inspector-General Michael Atkinson, Col. Alexander Vindman, and Lawfare ninjas Norm Eisen, Mary McCord, and Andrew Weissmann. He must know who in “Joe Biden’s” White House was coordinating the 92 felony prosecutions against Mr. Trump with DA Alvin Bragg and AG Letitia James in New York and DA Fani Willis Fulton County, GA.\n\nHe must know how BLM and Antifa were allowed to burn down Minneapolis in 2020, and riot in scores of other places. He must know what agencies and what persons in them coordinated the Covid-19 operation and which foreign entities were involved. (Was it the US military, as many suspect, and how, if at all, did freelance players such as Bill Gates and George Soros’s myriad organizations fit in the picture?) And how is the machinery of the Democratic Party entangled in the workings of US intel? (Prime suspects: Sen. Mark Warner and his staff.)\n\nYou can say much the same thing about FBI Director Kash Patel and his Deputy Director, Dan Bongino. They were apparently horrified by the rot they encountered there on taking office earlier this year. What is so difficult about firing people, even a whole lot of people? And why wouldn’t you say you are doing it? Likewise, Pam Bondi, at her resistance-infected DOJ?\n\nMy bags are packed, I’m ready to go. . . .\n\nMr. Trump had a rough week working through his “divorce” from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Both of them behaved rather badly; he the usual name-calling; she playing up to the cluster-B ignoramouses on The View, and then resigning from Congress in a snit (walking away from Daddy). The Epstein Files legislation she was twanging on the president about got passed in a flash and signed, but it contained rules that can easily be used to keep key documents suppressed. The suspicion will linger that it’s all about protecting Israel, and thereby stir-up continued animus against the Jews.\n\nMr. Trump had a ju-jitsu session in the Oval Office with NYC mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, the avowed communist jihadi — putting the young insta-celebrity pol off-balance by acting all nice and accommodating. “I want him to do a great job. . . “ “We agree on a lot more than I would have thought. . .” “It was a great honor [to meet him]. . . .” the president declared on his Truth Social account. Stand by on what any of that means.\n\nAnd now, as we plunge into Thanksgiving week, comes the Ukraine peace proposal. Everybody knows it is a recognition that Russia is grinding toward victory in any case, and carrying-on further slaughter and destruction on-the-ground is insane. But then, Ukraine’s ruler, Mr. Zelenskyy, is insane (probably high on drugs, too), and the EU leadership is insane seeking to start a war with Russia that it has zero ability to prosecute — and nevermind whatever the obdurate defenders of the UK’s sclerotic empire think they’re doing to keep the Ukraine War going. But, bottom line: there’s a good possibility that the war will be over before Christmas, and the world will be better off for that.\n\nWith all the above going on, America needs a break. \n\nEnjoy a turkey, if you can afford to buy one, and count your blessings — for we are still a blessed people in a blessed land, and we should all show a little gratitude for the privilege of just being here on a planet so superbly suited to our needs.",

        "text": "Charlamagne tha God is calling on politicians to stop throwing around the word “fascist” so much, especially if they intend to work with the same people they labeled with it.\n\n“I don’t want to hear any politicians call each other fascists, authoritarians, wannabe-dictators, communists — none of that kind of rhetoric anymore,” the co-host said during Monday’s episode of “The Breakfast Club.” “It’s all dead, because if you call someone that, and then turn around and say, ‘But I’m willing to work with them,’ it looks hypocritical.”\n\nHe went on to say that politicians are misusing the term anyway. \n\n“There is no such thing as working with fascists,” Charlamagne began to explain. “That’s not how fascism works. Fascism isn’t a normal political disagreement. So politicians need to stop using that kind of language because you don’t believe it. Leave that type of commentary for the social media crowd and just go do your job as a politician, because I feel like that rhetoric is irresponsible in this climate.”\n\nHe added that it only stirs Americans up and creates unnecessary division and outrage.\n\n“It riles people up. It makes folks mad at each other, fighting in the street, trying to kill our political opposition,” Charlamagne said. “Meanwhile, the politicians are working with each other. Like, no. So, they need to cut it out.”\n\nWatch the clip below. \n\nCharlamagne’s remarks come after New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani met with President Donald Trump last week after repeatedly referring to Trump as a “fascist.”\n\nReporters called out Mamdani during the his Friday Oval Office meeting with Trump, asking the politician if he still feels that Trump is a fascist. Before he could respond, Trump inserted himself.\n\n“You can just say yes, it’s easier than explaining,” Trump said at the time. \n\nIn a Sunday interview on “Meet the Press,” Mamdani affirmed to host Kristen Welker that he does indeed still think the president is a fascist.\n\n“So, Mr. Mayor-elect, just to be very clear, do you think that President Trump is a fascist?” Welker asked.\n\n“And after President Trump said that, I said, ‘Yes.’ And–,” he began before Welker cut in to ask, “So you do?”\n\n“And that’s something that I’ve said in the past. I say it today,” Mamdani answered. \n\n“And I think what I appreciated about the conversation that I had with the president was that we were not shy about the places of disagreement, about the politics that has brought us to this moment. And we also wanted to focus on what it could look like to deliver on a shared analysis of an affordable crisis for New Yorkers.”\n\nYou can watch “The Breakfast Club” segment in the video above.",

        "text": "Your suspicions about the user you're arguing with on Elon Musk's X being a fake might just be true.That's an experience that many users on X, formerly Twitter, are sharing since the platform's new \"About this account\" page went live with its \"Account based in\" feature. Basically, each X profile now discloses the country of origin a user is posting from. The feature, which X head of product Nikita Bier first teased last month, was originally rolled out on Friday night. Hours later, X removed the feature with Bier claiming there were some changes that needed to be made to address users that utilized VPNs to hide their location. However, by Saturday night, X had once again made the country of origin feature live for each account.\n\n X's location revealing feature is live. Here's how to make it less precise.\n\nThere are ways to obscure your location in X's settings. Users can choose to only show a general region like North America or Europe instead of the specific nation like the United States or Germany. While this might protect users who are afraid of being doxxed or need to be more private living under an oppressive regime of a more authoritarian country, these settings don't really affect how fake accounts are revealed.For example, X users discovered that the account @American, complete with a U.S. flag and bald eagle in their avatar, was not in fact a user from the United States but someone posting from \"South Asia.\"\n\n This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n\nAnother account called \"Mariana Times\" presented themselves as a U.S. citizen who spoke out about wanting to deport New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani because \"we want a nation\" and not \"foreigner\" who has not \"assimilated into American culture.\" While their avatar had an Israeli flag with an AI-looking woman standing in front of it, X's new feature revealed that Mariana is actually posting from India.\n\n This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n\nMany social media users have long wondered if foreign actors have been behind prominent anonymous political accounts that use the platform to sow discord or even just make easy money through monetization schemes. It's unclear just how large the scale is, but X's new location feature certainly confirmed the suspicion that this is happening.In addition, it shows that Elon Musk's goal to \"defeat the bots\" on X has largely been a failure. In fact, studies have shown that the bot and fake account problem on X has been even worse since Musk took over and made changes to the platform that made it easier for these type of fake accounts to prevail.However, with X's latest change, spearheaded by the newly-hired Bier, at least users will now get a good idea if they are arguing with one of these fake accounts. And more transparency is always a good thing.So, that \"Make America Great Again\" themed account that you've been duking it out with online for years? You may just now find out that the user claiming to be from the U.S. is actually from Russia, Nigeria, India, or elsewhere.\n\n This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n\n let cbeScripts = {\"twitterEmbed\":[\"https:\\/\\/platform.twitter.com\\/widgets.js\"]};\n let cbeScriptObserver = function (nodeType, scriptsArr) {\n let firstElem = document.querySelector('.' + nodeType)\n let self = this\n\n if (firstElem == null) {\n console.warn(`CBE cannot find element with class .${nodeType} for script observer.`)\n\n scriptsArr.forEach((scriptSrc) => {\n const linkEl = document.createElement('link')\n linkEl.rel = 'dns-prefetch'\n linkEl.href = scriptSrc\n document.head.append(linkEl)\n\n window[nodeType + 'Loaded'] = false\n\n this.embedObserver = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {\n entries.forEach((entry) => {\n if (entry.isIntersecting && window[nodeType + 'Loaded'] === false) {\n scriptsArr.forEach((scriptSrc) => {\n const el = document.createElement('script')\n el.src = scriptSrc\n el.async = true\n document.head.append(el);\n\n window[nodeType + 'Loaded'] = true\n self.embedObserver.disconnect()\n\n }, {root: null, rootMargin: '750px'})\n this.embedObserver.observe(firstElem)\n\n for (const item in cbeScripts) {\n new cbeScriptObserver(item, cbeScripts[item])",

        "text": "Shoppers plan to cut back their spending during the crucial Black Friday weekend for the first time in four years — the latest sign of mounting affordability concerns in the US, according to a survey.\n\nThose who plan to shop during the busy Black Friday and Cyber Monday events expect to spend an average of $622 – roughly 4% less than last year, according to a Deloitte survey of 1,200 US consumers.\n\nThe trend is hitting consumers on both ends of the income spectrum.\n\nShoppers making less than $50,000 a year are expected to spend 12% less than last year, while those earning more than $200,000 plan to cut spending by 18%, according to the survey.\n\nOf those who plan to spend less, 69% cited higher costs of living while 43% blamed financial constraints, according to the survey conducted between Oct. 15 and Oct. 23.\n\nIt’s a sharp turnaround in the survey’s findings. For the past four years straight, shoppers had said they planned to spend more than the previous year, according to the survey.\n\nIn another sign that shoppers are growing antsy over the economy, more consumers are expected to hunt for discounts and deals this year during the hectic Nov. 27 to Dec. 1 shopping period.\n\nAbout 82% of respondents said they plan to shop during the weekend, up from 79% in 2024, according to Deloitte.\n\nAs retailers offer fewer discounts and high-price holiday items lead to sticker shock, nearly two-thirds of shoppers are planning to use financing options – like credit cards or buy now, pay later apps – to stretch their budgets, according to the survey. \n\nBNPL options – including apps like Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm – allow shoppers to make a purchase and pay it off over time in installments, usually with no interest.\n\nYoung shoppers have taken advantage of these apps, with 39% of Gen Zers and millennials planning to use BNPL options to fund their Black Friday hauls, according to Deloitte.\n\nExperts have warned the popular payment options could lead shoppers to overspend and slip into debt.\n\nAmericans are not expecting relief anytime soon, expecting inflation to hit 4.5% by next year, according to the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey.\n\n“This season, consumers are eager to find the best deals to wrap up their holiday shopping. They have made their gift lists and are checking Black Friday-Cyber Monday promotions to stretch their budgets,” Natalie Martini, vice chair and leader of US Retail and Consumer Products at Deloitte, said in a statement. \n\n“While we expect shoppers to plan to pull back on spending, we also anticipate strong participation throughout the holiday week, with many planning to blend the convenience of online shopping with the energy of the in-store experience.”\n\nThe monthly consumer sentiment reading dropped to 50.3 earlier this month – the lowest level in more than three years and near the worst-ever figure, according to the survey.\n\nConcerns around affordability and sky-high costs propelled Dems like socialist NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani to victory earlier this month.\n\nThat has pushed President Trump to double down on his affordability agenda. \n\nHe has vowed to send $2,000 checks to most Americans before the 2026 midterms and slashed tariffs on staple food items like bananas and coffee.\n\nMeanwhile, inflation has heated up to 3% as of September – the fastest rate since January, according to the most recently available Consumer Price Index.\n\nThe labor market is still showing signs of weakness, too. \n\nWhile US employers added a better-than-expected 119,000 jobs in September, the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4% – its highest level since October 2021, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",

        "text": "Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts made a surprising announcement last month: The moderate Democrat said he would no longer accept donations from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).\n\nSpurning AIPAC was not, on its face, shocking. In the more than two years since Israel’s onslaught in Gaza began, numerous members of Congress have pledged not to accept money from the lobby, all from the more progressive wing of the Democratic Party. But for Moulton, who leans heavily on his background as a Marine who served multiple tours in Iraq, to join that cohort was surprising. Now gearing up for a potentially bruising primary as he challenges progressive stalwart Ed Markey for his Senate seat, Moulton apparently decided that turning his back on AIPAC and its allies was more politically advantageous than costly.\n\nThe growing list of members of Congress rejecting funding from AIPAC and other pro-Israel groups marks a stark turnaround from the primacy those organizations recently held in the halls of power.\n\nFor decades, AIPAC focused entirely on lobbying members of Congress and did not directly support individual candidates. That changed in 2021, when AIPAC launched several Political Action Committees (PACs) expressly designed to help pro-Israel candidates win their races. These PACs — the awkwardly named AIPAC PAC and the AIPAC-affiliated Super PAC, United Democracy Project — quickly became major players in the national political scene. They were soon joined by other pro-Israel PACs, most prominently Democratic Majority for Israel, whose leadership was closely aligned with AIPAC.\n\nIn 2022, these groups spent nearly $60 million in direct support or on behalf of candidates, placing AIPAC and its affiliates among the top 10 spenders that cycle. Among their targets was Michigan Rep. Andy Levin, a Jewish member of Congress and president of his synagogue. After 2020 redistricting that merged Levin’s district with that of another Democrat, Haley Stevens, the two faced off in the Democratic primary. AIPAC and its allies, apparently upset over Levin’s critique of Israel’s illegal annexation of Palestinian territory, poured more than $4 million into backing Stevens, who won the nomination handily.\n\nIn 2024, AIPAC’s reach broadened further. In the first major election cycle after October 7, AIPAC targeted some of Israel’s harshest critics in Congress, spending heavily to unseat progressives like Cori Bush and Jamaal Bowman. It spent a “record-shattering” $14.5 million to support George Latimer against Bowman, and another $8.5 million in St. Louis in support of Wesley Bell against Bush. Both Bowman and Bush were defeated. (The AIPAC watchdog site Track AIPAC rates Bell and Latimer as the top all-time recipients of AIPAC donations.)\n\nBy the end of the primary season, progressives and critics of Israel’s Gaza policy were publicly despairing. Bernie Sanders warned that AIPAC’s success would embolden the lobby to suppress critical voices wherever it found them.\n\nThen, something shifted. As Israel’s assault ground on, public sentiment on Israel-Palestine began to fracture. Surveys in mid-2024 showed clear divides in American opinion, with younger people and Democrats increasingly saying the Biden administration was too favorable toward Israel. Within the Democratic Party, these splits were even sharper: Nearly 50 percent of Democrats aged 18–29 said they sympathized more with Palestinians, compared with only 17 percent of those over 65.\n\nThese intraparty tensions were amplified by the Uncommitted movement, which urged Democratic voters in key states to select “uncommitted” during the party’s primary to protest the administration’s stance. In swing-state Michigan, the movement garnered more than 100,000 votes. Rifts deepened further when Democratic National Convention organizers denied speaking time to Ruwa Romman, a Palestinian-American Georgia House Representative recommended by the movement.\n\nMeanwhile, coalitions like Reject AIPAC pressed members of Congress to declare they would refuse AIPAC’s funding. By late 2024, with Kamala Harris facing Donald Trump in the general election, the Biden administration’s unqualified support for Israel had become a top issue. Harris, unwilling or unable to distance herself from Biden’s legacy, gave voters little reason to expect a shift in policy.\n\nUltimately, Harris hemorrhaged support among constituencies crucial to Biden’s 2020 win. Her backing among voters aged 18 to 49 dropped by 10 points from Biden’s 17-point margin in 2020. A pre-election analysis also showed that her support among Muslim voters lagged far behind Biden’s. In swing states like Michigan — where Harris lost by just over 80,000 votes — the significance of the more than 100,000 Uncommitted primary voters in that state was impossible to ignore. While the Uncommitted movement had aimed to serve as a warning to Democrats about the electoral liabilities of its Gaza policy via mounting a protest in the Democratic primaries, it had now become a grim predictor of Democrats’ weakness in the general election.\n\nNow, still reeling from their 2024 wipeout, and with Democratic support for Israel continuing to crater through 2025, the party finds itself at a crossroads. Many Democrats have decided that the electoral risks of taking AIPAC money now outweigh the benefits.\n\nMoulton is just one striking example of how quickly the tide is turning. Recently, former Missouri Rep. Cori Bush announced she would run again for her old seat, directly challenging the AIPAC-backed candidate Bell who unseated her last year. That Bush is mounting a comeback so quickly underscores how rapidly Bell’s close ties to the pro-Israel lobby have shifted from a strength to a liability.\n\nThis pattern is emerging elsewhere as well. In New York City, where Zohran Mamdani won the mayorship thanks in part to his support for Palestinian rights, progressives are eyeing multiple congressional seats — including that of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries — for primary challenges. Many of the representatives currently holding these seats — including Jeffries, Dan Goldman, and Ritchie Torres — are well-known for their close ties to the pro-Israel lobby. Torres, for example, has sponsored bills in Congress that lean heavily into AIPAC-promoted narratives about antisemitism on college campuses. He has also gained a reputation as one of the most ardent defender of Israel’s actions in Gaza on social media. Goldman, meanwhile, has been one of the most unwavering voices in supporting Israel’s “right to defend itself.”\n\nProgressives are betting that these affiliations, plus general outrage with mainstream Democrats’ feeble response to the Trump administration, will propel progressive challengers to victory.\n\nWith such a dramatic swing of the pendulum, the ball now appears to be back in AIPAC’s court. After funding the two most expensive Democratic primaries in history in 2024, AIPAC and its allies are likely to enter the 2026 cycle with ample resources. Whether the same scorched-earth spending strategy remains politically viable is unclear. The lobby will undoubtedly work to defend its closest allies and beat back challengers like Bush and the New York progressives. But it will have to consider how visibly it operates. Its reputation took another hit after Zohran Mamdani defeated Andrew Cuomo — twice — despite Cuomo’s vocal backing from pro-Israel billionaires and donors tied to Donald Trump, many of whom tried to make Mamdani’s criticism of Israel a central campaign issue.\n\nThis does not, of course, mean that AIPAC will relent in its quest to influence electoral outcomes within the Democratic primary. It does mean, however, that it may have to go to lengths to either obscure or downplay its role in campaign contributions and independent expenditures on behalf of candidates.\n\nAIPAC and its affiliates have long obscured their actual gripes with candidates they oppose in political advertising — their stances on Israel — instead focusing on those candidates’ stances on controversial domestic policies. They may push this trend further in coming cycles, making it harder for the average voter to determine when they’re subjected to messaging from the pro-Israel lobby.\n\nWhether this will be an effective adjustment in its strategy remains to be seen. As the political landscape continues to shift, the coming cycles may determine whether AIPAC can retain its once-unassailable influence — or whether rising skepticism of U.S. support for Israel signals a lasting realignment among Democrats.",

        "text": "President Donald Trump has found an unlikely ally in his old political rival’s son.\n\nNalin Haley, 24, the youngest child of Nikki Haley—Trump’s final Republican challenger in the 2024 primary—is making a name for himself as one of MAGA’s up-and-coming young voices.\n\nNalin told the Wall Street Journal on Sunday that he aligns most closely with Vice President JD Vance’s policies and would back him as a candidate in the 2028 presidential election if he can “somehow work on his charisma, aura and likability.”\n\nDespite campaigning alongside his mother during the 2024 race, Nalin—who majored in political science at Villanova University—said he was simply being a “good son” and was “never going to be an advocate for a view that I did not have.”\n\nAs he’s stepped into public life, Nalin has broken sharply with several of Nikki Haley’s long-held positions. While Nikki, whose parents are Indian immigrants, has supported legal pathways to the United States, Nalin told the British news site UnHerd earlier this month, “I think we need to stop legal immigration.” Last week, he also wrote on X that the U.S. should “end H1-B visas.”\n\nJust last week, Nalin argued in an interview with Tucker Carlson that naturalized citizens—such as New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani—should be barred from holding public office.\n\nNikki has been a fierce advocate for Israel, while Nalin told UnHerd that “Israel is just another country” and that it needs to stop “interfering in our politics.”\n\nNikki told the Journal she was “proud of the strong, intelligent people” Nalin and his 27-year-old sister Rena have become. “Our goal was to teach our children to have a deep faith, a strong work ethic and to think for themselves,” she said.\n\nResearch over decades has shown that the vast majority of American families pass on their political loyalties. A 2023 Pew Research Center survey found that eight in ten parents who were Republican or leaned Republican (81 percent) had teens who also identified as or leaned Republican. And about nine-in-ten Democratic or Democratic-leaning parents (89 percent) had teens aligned 9-in-10 Democratic or Democratic-leaning parents (89 percent) had teens aligned with them. \n\nBut Nalin’s divergence from his mother’s politics is far from the only break within a prominent political family in recent years.\n\nFormer Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway dominated headlines in 2020 as her daughter Claudia amassed millions of views on TikTok as a 15-year-old, slamming her mother’s politics and declaring she was seeking emancipation after learning Kellyanne would speak at the Republican National Convention. Kellyanne eventually resigned from the White House to focus on her “beloved children.”\n\nThe Kennedy family has long condemned the appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary. His sister, Kerry Kennedy, and his nephew, Joe Kennedy III, publicly called for his resignation after RFK Jr.’s disastrous September hearing before the U.S. Senate. Just this weekend, John F. Kennedy’s granddaughter Tatiana Schlossberg admonished Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in an essay revealing that she has less than a year to live following a terminal cancer diagnosis.\n\nTop Trump aide Stephen Miller is also no stranger to family estrangement. Last month, his first cousin publicly disowned him for becoming “the face of evil” as the architect of the Trump administration’s hardline immigration crackdown. And in 2018, his uncle David Glosser penned a scathing essay for Politico in which he described Miller as an “immigration hypocrite.”",

        "text": "However, the speaker added a cautionary note in his remarks to Fox News Digital, as pressure builds on the White House to produce tangible results on the economy swiftly.\n\n“The economy is a very complex thing; you don’t flip a switch and just change it all in one week,” he said. “It takes a while.”\n\nJohnson’s remarks come as Democrats have increasingly favored messaging on affordability ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, accusing the Trump administration of failing to sufficiently assuage voter concerns about the economy. \n\nThe House speaker said in the interview on Friday that relief is coming, but it will likely begin sometime next year, when provisions outlined in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act start taking effect.\n\n“By the time we get into the first and second quarter of next year, as Treasury Secretary [Scott] Bessent has said, we should have an economic boom because of all of these pieces will be coming into play,” Johnson said. “Taxes will be lower, no tax on tips and overtime, lower taxes on seniors. And then there’ll be more investment because we have all the pro-growth policies and tax policies that will allow the job creators, entrepreneurs, risk-takers, innovators to do what they do.”\n\n“Everything I just described will happen in due time, and it will,” he added. “So we’re very bullish about it.”\n\nDemocrats have attempted to capitalize on affordability matters in recent elections, using the topic to try to spur momentum in future campaigns. \n\nIn New York City, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani secured victory after building a sweeping movement focused on cost-of-living concerns.\n\nIn response, Trump has tried to frame the GOP as the “party of affordability,” arguing that Democrats created an economic crisis during the Biden years and that his White House is “relentlessly” focused on resolving concerns.\n\n“Affordable” should be “our word, not theirs,” Trump said during a speech last week at McDonald’s Impact Summit. He added that his administration has it “down to a low level, but we’re going to get it a little bit lower.”\n\n“We want perfection,” Trump said. “Because the Democrats got up and took affordability, affordability, and they don’t say that they had the worst inflation in history, the highest energy prices in history. Everything was the worst. What they’re great at is lying. They say affordability. This stuff was all much more expensive.”",

        "text": "How did a 34-year-old democratic socialist become the mayor of the city that built Wall Street? New York, the global hub of capitalism, just handed the keys to City Hall to Zohran Mamdani, a young politician whose platform promises to reshape the most powerful financial city on Earth. It's an extraordinary experiment. Can socialism coexist within the beating heart of global finance?I have lived and worked for over three decades in the world of finance and capital markets in New York and have seen cycles come and go, from the near-collapse of the early 1990s to the Great Financial Crisis, and the COVID shock that emptied Manhattan's streets. Yet this moment feels different. Mamdani's election is a symptom of a deeper, global frustration.New Yorkers are angry, and many are desperate. The affordability crisis has reached a breaking point. Renters are spending half their income on housing, grocery bills have soared, and young professionals, burdened with student debt, are living in overcrowded small apartments. Mamdani tapped into that pain with political precision. He promised relief: rent freezes, free public transit, universal childcare, a $30 minimum wage, and a more humane approach to policing. His message struck a nerve that crossed boroughs and generations.But the math behind those promises is far less romantic. Mamdani's central fiscal plan to \"tax the rich\" plays well at rallies, but the numbers tell a different story. In New York, the top 1% of earners contribute nearly half of all personal income tax revenue. Push that group too far, and they'll take their companies, their investments, and their employees elsewhere. Florida and Texas are already rolling out the red carpet for high earners leaving high-tax states. Once that capital leaves, it's almost impossible to bring it back.Municipal budgets are not abstract. They pay teachers, firefighters, subway repairs, and hospitals. Dramatic tax hikes or policies that disincentivize private investment risk slower hiring, lower property values, deferred projects, and fewer philanthropic dollars. Some insist that bold redistribution and aggressive reforms are both morally urgent and politically feasible. Others argue that limitless taxes will trigger a capital flight away from New York. Both positions have merit in theory, and both fail if they don't consider the broader picture. The question is how to pay for it without hollowing out the city's revenue base.New York has been here before: battered, bruised, and reborn. In the mid-1970s, the city teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, and only through wrenching compromises between public institutions and private markets did it survive. Those years taught the city a hard lesson. Institutions and markets matter, and once capital flees, recovery is long and painful. Municipal finances are fragile, but the resilience of citizens and infrastructure is remarkable when properly supported.If bold experiments are pursued without credible fiscal planning, the city faces immediate risks: rising crime, falling tourism, businesses relocating, and a weakened tax base that could take decades to rebuild. Think of New York as a complex machine: remove the lubrication of capital and confidence, and the gears seize. Conversely, when private capital and public purpose align, the city hums. Jobs are created, rents stabilize, and civic institutions thrive.The winning playbook is pragmatic partnership: target aid to the truly needy, invest in housing supply and affordability, and design revenue measures that broaden rather than chase away the base. Reforms must include measurable outcomes and replacement investments, not mere budget cuts or new taxes.If the mayor successfully builds coalitions across business and labor, and presents a clear fiscal plan balancing compassion with competitiveness, New York will adapt once more. I am betting on resilience. New Yorkers are stubbornly durable, but resilience alone will not save us if the city's economic engine is dismantled. The real test is creating an environment where idealism can coexist with capitalism. For this experiment to work, socialism must find a way to work with capitalism to create a better New York, for all New Yorkers.About the AuthorEdward L.

        "text": "Donald Trump and Zohran Mamdani’s meeting last week has been making headlines, and how even now. Trump was full of praise for the NYC mayor-elect during his briefing with the press. Now, the two have been occupying headline space for their similar outfit choices.\n\nIt started with a viral clip of Donald Trump interacting with the media recently. In the video, Trump is seen ditching his signature style – with suits and ties – and is dressed like Zohran Mamdani. The 34-year-old leader’s signature style is all about turtlenecks and blazers and Trump is seen donning one in the video.\n\nAn X user shared a clip on the social media platform, which features Trump dressed in a maroon turtleneck and a black blazer. Drawing a line from Trump’s new style to that of Mamdani’s signature one, the X user wrote, “He meets with Mamdani one time and immediately tries to step his swag up.”\n\nHe meets with Mamdani one time and immediately tries to step his swag up https://t.co/5vScvSvqrG\n— Ahmed Baba (@AhmedBaba_) November 22, 2025\n\nThe Internet couldn’t help but notice the stark similarities in the two styles. “I gotta one up Mamdani charm offensive,” read a comment. “He’s tucking his chin flaps into his turtleneck like a muffin top in a pair of high-waisted jeans,” read another one. Another user added, “Man woke up and said, make drip great again.”\n\nSimilar thoughts echoed in the comments section. “That fit, though iconic in a very confusing way,” a netizen commented. Another one wrote, “Haha he got so impressed by Mamdani.” Another X user jokingly wrote, “Mamdani actually recommended this in his meeting with Trump.”\n\nThe picture that originally started the conversation was this one. The post featured a picture collage of a recent photograph of Trump, juxtaposed with a relatively old click of Mamdani. The two can be seen twinning in the picture. However, the photo on the right is a tweaked version. The original click actually features Mamdani dressed in a grey turtleneck, not red.\n\nBREAKING: Trump COPIES Mamdani’s outfit.\nWho wrote it BETTER? pic.twitter.com/n1HlmIz32G\n— Spencer Hakimian (@SpencerHakimian) November 23, 2025\n\nMeanwhile, a section of the Internet went on to troll Trump. “Those colors don’t really look good with orange,” an X user wrote. “Sincerest form of flattery,” read a second comment. “Trump wants to look like a Socialist because he thinks he can save NY votes. Hey, Dozy Don, it isn’t going to work,” read a third.\n\nSome netizens even dug out old pictures of Barack Obama and claimed that the former President pulled off that look first when he showed up at the National Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony back in 2011.\n\nAfter conducting his meeting with Mamdani last week, Trump said, “We’ve just had a great meeting—a really good, very productive meeting.” “We had a meeting today that actually surprised me. He wants to see no crime. He wants to see housing being built. He wants to see rents coming down. All things that I agree with,” Trump said on Friday.\n\nThe President was all praises for Mamdani, and he said, “I expect to be helping him, not hurting him — a big help, because I want New York City to be great. I think he wants to make it greater than ever before, and if he can, we’ll be out there cheering. I’ll be cheering for him.”\n\nAs for Mamdani, this is what he had to say about Trump post the meeting last week at the Oval Office, “I appreciated the time with the president. I appreciated your conversation. We are very clear about our positions and our views, and what I really appreciate about the president is the meeting that we had focused not on places of disagreement, of which there are many, but instead focused on the shared purpose that we have in serving New Yorkers.”",

        "text": "On Friday, President Donald Trump welcomed New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, to The White House. The sitting president didn’t call the incoming mayor of America’s biggest city a communist or any other previously used insult. The two leaders were respectful, some might say even optimistic. The future of the country does not appear as divided as it did even months before.\n\nHours later, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a MAGA stalwart, announced her upcoming resignation from the House. The firebrand has seemingly curbed her language towards the other, offering those who both agreed with her conspiracy theories and loathed her stances a chance to bring down the temperature. Partly due to her persistence, the release of the Epstein files became a bipartisan issue, as did the looming expiration of pandemic-era Affordable Care Act subsidies. The future of the country does not appear as divided as it did even months before.\n\nOnly time will tell which news will be more impactful. But both of these stories may have offered an off ramp to identity politics.It’s fair to say Greene once represented the extreme of the GOP. Gaining nationwide notoriety for peddling conspiracies and elevating QAnon, she was once a pariah on nationwide media and extremely popular in her district. \n\nFive years after winning her seat, she’s stepping down while apologizing for raising the temperature, appearing like a pretty mainstream politician on pretty mainstream daytime talk shows like The View. \n\nLike I’ve pointed out before, most of Greene’s views haven’t exactly changed. But the rhetoric definitely has. And the rhetoric had been pretty consistent since the current sitting president rode a golden elevator down to announce his official bid for his first term.Some pundits are positing all of this just means she’s running for statewide office, or maybe even running for president. Great. \n\nIf that is the case, it’s an even bigger example of the beginning of the end of identity politics. If conspiracy theories and hateful rhetoric work in fewer congressional districts and other areas, that’s a larger sign it’s ending. Motivations may mean something in a court of law, but not when it comes to actually changing opinions. \n\nIt’s fair to say Mamdani has been portrayed by some media ecosystems as the extreme left. A young politician unafraid of embracing the boogeyman-inducing word socialist, Mamdani went from unknown politician polling at single digits to winning a more than a 50 percent of votes in a three-way mayoral race. \n\nHe didn’t win that race simply because he was the only democratic socialist on the ticket; he won because he championed some common-sense issues. (It’s the economy, stupid). \n\nSimilar to Greene, Mamdani embraced some of the same issues that helped Trump win over 30 percent of NYC voters in 2024. Like Mamdani said in the White House on Friday, “When we spoke to those voters who voted for President Trump, we heard them speak about cost of living. We focused on that same cost of living. And that’s where I am really looking forward to delivering for New Yorkers in partnership with the President on the affordability agenda.” (It’s the economy, stupid.)The biggest surprise on Friday wasn’t Greene’s resignation video. \n\nOr Mamdani and Trump’s meet-cute. \n\nOr Trump posing in front of a portrait of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. \n\nOr Trump being cool with Mamdani calling him a fascist. \n\nThe long-term takeaway came early in their shared remarks to the assembled press. \n\nThat was when Trump said, “I think you’re going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor. The better he does, the happier I am, I will say. There’s no difference in party. There’s no difference in anything. And we’re going to be helping him to make everybody’s dream come true, having a strong and very safe New York. And congratulations, Mr. Mayor.”\n\nOnce again: “There’s no difference in party. There’s no difference in anything.” Is this the moment we will identify as the beginning of the end of identity politics? One meeting and one resignation video does not dismiss the enormity of the actual actions of any politician last week. \n\nDuring the same week Trump buddied up to his new favorite New Yorker, he dismissed the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi, gave Ukraine less than a week to accept a proposal that favors Russia to end the war that Russia started, called a reporter “piggy” and welcomed back to the White House the man who slashed hundreds of thousands of federal jobs, Elon Musk. \n\nWe are still not living in an era of civility. \n\nBut when three of the most important names in the game, from vastly divergent political backgrounds, are willingly cooling things down, it does appear that there’s now an off-ramp for some of the most heated partisanship. \n\nReality check: If Trump and Greene were to step back from their long-standing claims that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, that would be evidence of a huge step. \n\nNevertheless, last week’s baby steps are still progress.",

She also wants to defund the police.\n\nBehn did try to salvage her campaign, saying she's cried at the Country Music Hall of Fame \"at least ten times\" and that the audio we all clearly heard is a GOP psy-op to distract from her winning the election.\n\nBless her heart.\n\nBehn had another chance to distance herself from her radical record, namely her push to defund the police, on an appearance on MS NOW. And she didn't do it.\n\nDemocrat Aftyn Behn refuses THREE TIMES to walk back her previous calls to defund the police:MSNBC: \"Do you still stand by those comments?\"BEHN: \"I'm not going to give cable news talking points....MSNBC: \"What is your position today?\"BEHN: \"I'm gonna talk about my race.\" pic.twitter.com/92YRm2KMOk— RNC Research (@RNCResearch) November 24, 2025\n\nThey asked Behn about some now-deleted 2020 tweets in which she said the Nashville PD should be \"dissolved\" and that she supported teachers' union demands to defund the police as a condition of reopening schools.\n\nAnother post read, \"Good morning, especially to the 54 percent of Americans that believe burning down a police station is justified.\"\n\nThe anchor asked, \"Do you still stand by those comments, and if not, is there anything you want to clarify?\"\n\nBehn replied, \"I'm not going to engage in cable news talking points, but what I will say is that our communities need solutions, we ned local people solving local problems with local solutions. And that's not the overreach of the federal government or state government of which are dealing with in Nashville and our cities across Tennessee.\"\n\nThe anchor asked a second time if Behn wanted to clarify her remarks.\n\n\"Once again, I don't remember these tweets,\" Behn replied.\n\nThe anchor gave her a third try to explain her position.\n\n\"Once again, I'm going to talk about my race,\" Behn replied.\n\nHouse Democrats and the DNC are both actively funding a candidate who not only endorsed defunding the police, she endorsed **burning down police stations*** https://t.co/EgOj5A5q5h pic.twitter.com/Qgz95dg8KM— Zach Parkinson (@AZachParkinson) November 24, 2025\n\nThe Democrats seem incapable of condemning violence and often condone and encourage violence.\n\nHer opponent, Matt Van Epps reminded voters only they can stop Behn.\n\n.@aftynfortn wants to defund the police.

        "text": "Joel Holsinger just quit his day job to bet on the words that famous people, like White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, might say in public. \"I thought there was a very high likelihood she would bring up 'Thanksgiving' in relation to the shutdown,\" he said.From his computer, the 26-year-old makes about $3,000 a week trading on the prediction market Kalshi.\"She did not say Thanksgiving, so we were out $700 yesterday,\" Holsinger said. That hurts, right? \"Surprisingly for me, doesn't hurt really much,\" Holsinger replied. \"I have had times where I've lost, for example, like, $6,000 on a bad trade, but also the inverse of that; I've made $11,000 on a trade, and so, you know, it's just ups-and-downs.\" The live streaming influencer is one of millions of people flocking to prediction markets like Kalshi, PredictIt and Polymarket where you can wager on just about anything.Tarek Mansour and Luana Lopes Lara are former Wall Street traders-turned-co-founders of Kalshi. \"A prediction market is like the stock market, but instead of buying and selling companies, you're buying 'yes' and 'no' on whether something is going to happen or not,\" Mansour said. \"So, it could be whether Mamdani was going to win the last New York mayor's race, or there's going to be a hurricane in Florida next month.\"Lopes Lara said, \"People can make money on what they know, actually monetize their knowledge, monetize their hobby, because everyone is an expert on something.\" Kalshi made a name for itself in the 2024 election. The presidential race looked close, unless you were keeping an eye on Kalshi, which called the race well before the TV networks did. \"It was like Kalshi, then Fox, then CNN,\" said Mansour. \"It was crazy.\"Twelve months later, Kalshi was the talk of another election: The New York City mayor's race. As Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani told the crowd on Oct. 26, \"You see the Kalshi odds that have our chances of victory in the 90s.\"Kalshi's numbers are not polling data; they represent what people think is going to happen. \"It's people putting money on what they think is going to happen, and then the wisdom of the crowds in the markets come up with the probabilities of who is going to win,\" said Lopes Lara.And you can bet on (or Kalshi says \"invest in\") more than 3,500 markets on the company's platform, like who will be a bridesmaid in Taylor Swift's wedding. I asked, \"How do I know that someone close to Taylor Swift, or Taylor Swift herself, isn't participating in a way that will make her outcome more favorable and let her, you know, take home a little extra cash?\"Lopes Lara replied, \"Kalshi is a federally-regulated, fully-compliant exchange, and we have systems in place to monitor for any suspicious or unusual activity. We also have a lot of trading prohibitions in place.\"According to Mansour, \"There really hasn't been any issues.\" Prediction markets are booming. The owner of the New York Stock Exchange is investing $2 billion in Polymarket, and the sports betting platform FanDuel will launch its own prediction market next month.In fact, when it's not an election, the majority of the money traded on Kalshi is not on politics or culture – it's on sports. Jonathan Cohen, author of \"Losing Big,\" has chronicled the rise of sports betting in the U.S. Regarding Kalshi, he said, \"You can bet on things that a traditional Sportsbook would offer you.\"\"Kalshi says this is an investment. You don't buy that?\"\"No,\" said Cohen. \"The New England Patriots are not more likely to win their game because I bought a contract for them to win the game. It is a speculative instrument purely for my own use and my own entertainment, which to me qualifies it as gambling rather than investing.\"But Kalshi is not regulated like gambling. Online sports betting is only legal in 31 states; Kalshi is available in all 50. The Biden administration tried to prevent Kalshi from offering sports markets. Then, when President Trump returned to the White House, his administration vowed to break with \"past hostility\" – and earlier this year, the president's son, Donald Jr, became a strategic advisor to both Kalshi and its main rival, Polymarket. Asked why Kalshi made Donald Trump Jr. a strategic advisor, Mansour replied, \"We have a lot of advisors, um, and they span across the board, across different functions. But really, this is all about growing this industry, the prediction market industry, that a lot of people really believe in.\"I asked, \"What kind of advice does he give you?\"\"So, it really is, again, about growing prediction markets,\" Mansour said. \"You know, he believes in prediction markets. We believe in prediction markets. A lot of people believe in prediction markets, and it's really about go-to-market and expansion plans.\"\"Does he come to meetings? How much do you pay him? What's his role? I mean, this is the son of the president.\"\"We, again, I mean, we have a lot of advisors,\" Mansour replied. \"And whether it's our investors, whether it's, uh, people that we really trust and respect, whether – \"\"But he's not just any advisor; he has a direct line to the White House,\" I said. \"We have a lot of advisors,\" said Mansour. Kalshi is embroiled in legal battles with several states, like Massachusetts, that say Kalshi's sports markets amount to \"unlawful sports wagering.\"Are the states wrong? \"We are confident in what we're doing,\" said Mansour. \"We're confident in our position from the law, and we're also confident in the fact that, you know, customers are actually finding a lot of value in basically what we're offering. So, I would say yes.\"But for now, if you are over the age of 18, you can bet on just about anything, anywhere, any time. Cohen said, \"It's not enough to, like, like Taylor Swift anymore. You have to use your knowledge of Taylor Swift to, like, try to make money off of how many streams she's going to get in a month. Or it's not enough to, I don't know, even like politics anymore; you have to gamble on politics. You have to make money on politics.\"That, to me, it seems like sort of the canary in the coal mine of like a 'gamblification' of American culture that I think is sort of still on the rise,\" he said, \"and we might not like what that looks like when it fully arrives.\" For more info:Kalshi\"Losing Big: America's Reckless Bet on Sports Gambling\" by Jonathan D.

        "text": "Sunny Hostin believes that Zohran Mamdani successfully “played” Donald Trump during his recent visit to the White House. \n\n The legal expert weighed in on the unexpectedly friendly meeting between New York City’s mayor-elect and the president on Monday’s episode of The View. \n\n “Mamdani played him like a New Yorker would play anybody,” Hostin said. “That’s the bottom line. New Yorkers, we’re a special breed of people, okay? I’m from the Bronx. He lived in Queens. He went to school in the Bronx. Game knows game.” \n\n The cohost explained that Mamdani won over Trump by speaking his language. \n\n “He talked about housing, he talked about building housing, affordability, let’s face it, Trump wants a bit of the New York housing business,” she added. “This was about business. Mamdani, we’ve gotta give it to him — he played it like a politician.”\n\n After months of exchanging barbs in the lead-up to the New York City mayoral election, Mamdani and Trump appeared to be in good standing when the mayor-elect visited the White House on Nov. 21. \n\n During their meeting, Trump waved off Mamdani’s previous insults about him when brought up by reporters and described the 34-year-old Democratic Socialist as a “very rational person” who “wants to see New York be great again,” the Associated Press reports. The president added, “I want him to do a great job and will help him do a great job.” \n\n Mamdani, in turn, noted that he and Trump both ran their recent political campaigns on the importance of affordability. Trump also acknowledged the common ground between them, adding, “We had some interesting conversations and some of his ideas are the same that I have.” \n\n Get your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter.\n\n Speaking on The View, Ana Navarro noted that, despite living in Florida, Trump is and always has been a New Yorker at heart. \n\n “His name is all over this city. His friends are all from New York. This is where he has spent most of his adult life,” she said, with Joy Behar stating, “He got 24 percent of the vote.”\n\n Alyssa Farah Griffin added that the meeting showcased how “the populist left and the populist right overlap” on a lot more issues than either side would expect. \n\n “Those of us who are not Democratic Socialists or far right, alt-right MAGA types are like, ‘I’m sorry, someone please represent us,’” she said. “And it’s neither of these.”\n\n Earlier in the segment, Behar said that Trump has always wanted the \"love of New York\" and its people.\n\n “He grew up in Queens, the Manhattanites always rejected him, they thought he was trashy, whatever they said, and he wants it so badly,\" she said. \"So that’s to our advantage in New York, maybe, because we need the money from the federal government.” \n\n The View airs weekdays on ABC.",

First Elphaba and Glinda patched things up, and now Jerry O'Connell and John Stamos' years-long feud is over.\n\n Two years after O'Connell publicly declared that he wouldn't read Stamos' memoir, If You Would Have Told Me, in which the Full House alum makes some choice comments about his 2005 divorce from Rebecca Romijn — whom O'Connell married in 2007 — the duo has seemingly made amends. At least enough to pose for a selfie together.\n\n On Saturday, The Talk alum shared a smiling selfie with Stamos and his wife Caitlin McHugh at Howie Mandel's 70th birthday celebration.\n\n \"First @zohrankmamdani and @realdonaldtrump,\" O'Connell captioned the Instagram post, referencing the recent meeting between New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and President Donald Trump. \"Then me and @johnstamos.\"\n\n Political quips aside, O'Connell shared kind words for the couple, adding, \"Gorgeous fam and gorgeous people @johnstamos & @caitlinskybound.\"\n\n Mandel was more than happy to take credit for the reconciliation. \"This is what I do,\" the America's Got Talent judge quipped in the comments. \"I bring people together. You're welcome.\"\n\n Stamos published his memoir in October 2023, in which he addresses both the highs and lows of his career and personal life, including his divorce from Rebecca Romijn, to whom he was married from 1998 to 2005, and his long road to sobriety, which began with his DUI arrest in 2015.\n\n In a conversation with PEOPLE at the time, Stamos said the divorce \"shattered\" him. \"In my mind back then, she was the devil, and I just hated her,\" he said. \"I couldn't believe how much I hated her, and it ruined my life.\" He eventually recognized that he played \"some part\" in the split. \"You start thinking, 'She wasn't the devil. Maybe I was as much to blame as her.'\"\n\n But O'Connell had no interest in Stamos' realization. During an appearance on Andy Cohen's SirusXM radio show in November 2023, he told Cohen that he and Romijn don't have \"any interest\" in diving into the memoir especially after learning the book accuses Romijn of cheating during their relationship and Stamos spoke about how he felt \"emasculated\" during his marriage to Romijn in an interview with Howard Stern.\n\n O'Connell noted that it got \"awkward\" with his twin daughters with Romjin. \"My children are 14 and they see what we see now,\" O'Connell said at the time. \"There's no hiding, there's no more keeping things from them. It's pretty crazy when your kids come out for breakfast and go, 'Hey mom, your ex has a book out and called you the devil. What are your thoughts?'\"\n\n In Stamos' interview with Stern, the actor spoke about how he struggled with Romijn's rising fame during their marriage. \"I think that she outgrew me,\" he said, acknowledging that he should've tried harder to save the marriage. \"I didn't work as hard as I should at anything.\"\n\n As for the Star Trek: Strange New Worlds star's thoughts, she shared her perspective with Entertainment Tonight in January 2024. The actress confessed that she was \"blindsided\" by Stamos' book.\n\n \"I was very surprised by all of that, incredibly shocked actually,\" Romijn said. \"But, you know, I don't really want to help him sell his books based on those headlines. So that's all I really want to say about it.\"\n\n Get your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter.\n\n Romijn and O'Connell met at the Maxim Hot 100 bash in 2004 and married three years later. Their twin daughters were born December 2008.\n\n Stamos married McHugh in February 2018, two months before they welcomed their son, Billy, 7.",

        "text": "The campaign firm that helped Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani spread his message in New York City is now turning its focus to vulnerable Republicans across the country. Among other races, the firm has set its sights on defeating two vulnerable House Republicans in Pennsylvania: Reps. Rob Bresnahan and Ryan Mackenzie. Fight Agency — a six-man crew with experience in over 300 winning elections — focuses on many of the issues Mamdani made a fixture of his campaign, like affordability and housing. \"If you're doing everything right but finding it harder and harder to get by, you're not alone. We know a simple truth about American life: the economy is not delivering enough for enough people. If the next forty years are like the last forty years, the American middle class will disappear,\" the firm states on its website. REPUBLICANS TARGET 2 KEY DEMOCRATIC RACES WITH MAMDANI CONNECTION STRATEGY The balance of power in the House of Representatives is in a precarious position ahead of the 2026 midterms. With Republicans holding just a three-seat majority, even one or two key losses for Republicans could cut the legs out from under the GOP's control over the chamber. Pennsylvania — home to both Bresnahan and Mackenzie — also makes up a key battleground state with several competitive districts. According to the Cook Political Report, the state has five competitive Republican-held districts all projected to be a five-point contest or less. In that struggle, the Fight Agency’s leaders have come to the support of Paige Cognetti, a former mayor of Scranton, Pa., who is running to unseat Bresnahan. Bresnahan, a freshman lawmaker, won election to Congress in 2024 by just 1.6 percentage points. \"We can stand tall against a Washington that takes advantage of working people and makes it work for us,\" Cognetti said in her launch video. Rebecca Katz, the Fight Agency’s strategist for the election of Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., reposted Cognetti’s campaign ad in a post to X. \"If you can, pls chip in a few bucks and let’s get someone who cares about people in Congress,\" Rebecca Katz wrote. Cognetti, the former mayor, has also highlighted the firm’s other work, saying she was \"proud to know these folks\" in a repost showcasing the agency’s past campaigns. SOCIALIST WAVE SPREADS COAST TO COAST AS PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS RALLY AROUND ZOHRAN MAMDANI'S NYC WIN Like in Cognetti’s campaign, the Fight Agency team is also supporting Bob Brooks and his race against Republican incumbent Ryan Mackenzie in Pennsylvania. Mackenzie won election by a single percentage point in the last cycle. \"The biggest problem we face is a Washington that burns working people,\" Brooks said in his campaign launch video. \"I’m running for Congress in one of the closest districts to take on the billionaires and big corporations holding us back.\" Morris Katz, the firm’s lead on the Mamdani campaign, reposted Cognetti’s launch video alongside Fight Agency’s main account. Brooks has returned the favor, reposting Fight Agency’s productions in a Maine Senate race. SCOOP: HOUSE REPUBLICANS LINK MAYOR-ELECT MAMDANI TO VULNERABLE CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS With Mamdani, the firm helped produce lighthearted content with a brighter, more comedic edge. In one video, the firm mimicked the style of \"The Bachelor,\" the TV romance show known for its match-making drama. \"New York, will you accept this rose?\" Mamdani asked in the video. In the past, the firm has supported Democrat candidates away from the mainstream of the party, gravitating towards either more progressive candidates or candidates with an unconventional streak. Besides Mamdani, some of Fight Agency’s previous partners include Sen. Bernie Sanders,’ I-Vt., bid for president and Sen. John Fetterman’s 2021 campaign.

        "text": "Trumpworld schism: On Friday night, MAGA Queen Marjorie Taylor Greene announced her resignation from Congress. \"I've always represented the common American man and woman as a member of the House of Representatives, which is why I've always been despised in Washington, D.C. and just never fit in. Americans are used by the political industrial complex of both political parties, election cycle after election cycle, in order to elect whichever side can convince Americans to hate the other side more,\" the Georgia Republican said in her resignation video:\n\nMy message to Georgia's 14th district and America.Thank you. pic.twitter.com/tSoHCeAjn1\n— Marjorie Taylor Greene ???????? (@mtgreenee) November 22, 2025\n\nGreene struck predictably populist America First notes (\"Americans' hard-earned tax dollars always fund foreign wars, foreign aid, and foreign interests\") and mapped her disagreements with the president (\"H1Bs replacing American jobs, AI state moratoriums, debt for life 50 year mortgage scams, standing strongly against all involvement in foreign wars, and demanding the release of the Epstein files\") while touting her loyalty. Read her full statement here.\n\nUntil recently, Greene and President Donald Trump seemed to be thick as thieves. But the Epstein files tore them asunder, with Greene positioning herself as an ardent advocate for full transparency while Trump (until recently) refused to go along. The president, pissed off by Greene's adamance, disavowed her and started publicly musing about how someone should mount a primary challenge, calling his once-loyal acolyte a \"ranting lunatic.\"\n\nThe Epstein issue wedged the door open for Greene to raise more grievances with Trump, especially the idea that he's been getting distracted from his domestic agenda and hasn't delivered much financial relief to the American people. The conflict came to a head during the recent government shutdown. \"I don't see political party lines,\" said Greene, discussing health care and the many Americans who could soon see premiums spiking. Greene criticized her own side for having no workable plan in place to prevent these higher costs.\n\n\"I don't know what happened to Marjorie,\" said Trump recently. \"Nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think.\"\n\nMany of her constituents are still behind her. \"I feel like she has stood her ground,\" Meredith Rosson, a 43-year-old paralegal and the chairwoman of the Republican Party in Chattooga County, told The New York Times. The Republican Party in Floyd County, also in Greene's district, issued a statement of \"unwavering support\" for Greene as soon as she announced her resignation. \"She's realized, 'I need to do what's right for my community and for people who are mostly in the middle ground,'\" cocktail bar/gun store owner Brandon Pledger told the Times.\n\nScenes from New York: \"Violent crime is overwhelmingly the work of a small group of repeat offenders—that is, it is highly concentrated. The remedy, as [James Q.] Wilson argued half a century ago in his classic book Thinking About Crime, is not social engineering but incapacitation: keeping the violent few from striking again,\" argues Tal Fortgang in City Journal. \"In 2022, the New York Times reported that 'nearly a third of all shoplifting arrests in New York City…involved just 327 people,' or 0.004 percent of the population, who had been 'arrested and rearrested more than 6,000 times.'\"\n\n\"We had some interesting conversation, and some of his ideas really are the same ideas I have,\" President Donald Trump said of his Friday meeting with incoming New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani. \"The new word is affordability.\" They appeared to be rather fond of each other, and Trump was in peak form:\n\nQ: Are you affirming that you think President Trump is a fascist?\nMAMDANI: I've spoken about--\nTRUMP: That's okay. You can just say yes. I don't mind. pic.twitter.com/uWZFRcmGxB\n— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) November 21, 2025\n\n\"It's not as though [Tucker] Carlson's decision to platform [Nick] Fuentes—a Gen Z livestreamer with a history of making Holocaust jokes, who predictably used his appearance on Carlson's show to rail against 'organized Jewry in America'—came out of nowhere. Anyone who's been paying attention knows that the former Fox News star left the world of responsible politics behind long ago,\" writes Reason's Stephanie Slade. \"Not that [Heritage President Kevin] Roberts seemed to care….Once you crawl into bed with the likes of Tucker Carlson, you're stuck. What you told yourself was a strategic play for relevance can turn out to be a deal with the devil instead.\"\n\"Exchange-traded funds investing in Bitcoin are heading for their worst month of outflows since launching nearly two years ago, piling yet more pressure on a jaded crypto market,\" reports Bloomberg. \"Investors have pulled $3.5 billion from the US-listed Bitcoin ETFs so far in November, almost equaling the previous monthly record for outflows of $3.6 billion set in February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. BlackRock Inc.'s Bitcoin fund IBIT, which accounts for about 60% of the cohort's assets, has registered $2.2 billion in redemptions in November, meaning it will slump to its worst month barring a sharp reversal.\"\nNorth Carolina's Republicans aren't so sure about the federal immigration raids in their districts.\nI'm getting some crazy hate mail for defending the tradwives",

        "text": "The spectacle of last week was the meeting between President Donald Trump and New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, two politicians been going after each other for months. Trump, who had called Mamdani a \"communist lunatic\" during the mayoral election, now declared Mamdani \"a very rational person.\" When journalists asked Mamdani about his past attacks on Trump's \"fascist agenda,\" the president beamed, patted Mamdani, and added, \"That's OK. You can just say it.\"\n\nIn some ways, the encounter resembled Trump's meeting with the new Syrian president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, in May 2025. \"Young, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter,\" Trump said of al-Sharaa, former head of Al Qaeda in Syria. It was also a throwback to Trump's first-term outreach to North Korea. After threatening the country with \"fire and fury,\" he had a series of meetings with its leader, Kim Jong Un, whom Trump came to praise as a \"very honorable\" negotiating partner.\n\nOther leaders often take Trump as a sucker for flattery. Since he's apparently willing to bury the hatchet with a few kind words, the thinking goes, those words must be the secret to appeasing him. It rarely works, because Trump is good at smelling weakness. But he respects strength. Trump accepts outreach from former enemies—domestic opponents or foreign warlords—because he enjoys the feeling that he has tamed a dangerous beast.\n\nWith Trump, \"flattery is ultimately counter-productive. In the short term, it avoids a public clash and may even help limit punishment in the form of tariffs or public criticism. In the longer term, far from buying respect, it earns his disdain and encourages the assumption that allies will cave on policy,\" former Biden administration official Philip Gordon wrote in the Financial Times last week.\n\nPerhaps nothing has illustrated this principle better than Trump's relationship with Europe. In a bid to keep American military aid to Ukraine flowing, European leaders have practiced their best flattery skills. In June 2025, North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary General Mark Rutte creepily called Trump \"Daddy.\" In August 2025, a group of European leaders crowded around Trump's desk while he reclined in his chair, like supplicants before a king.\n\nHumiliation begets humiliation. Over and over again, Trump has insulted Europe and made it clear that negotiations for the future of Ukraine will happen over the Europeans' heads. He has demanded a cut from Ukraine's natural resources and pushed the European Union to take a lopsided trade deal that puts tariffs on European products while exempting American ones.\n\nOther allies have tried, and failed with, the same approach. Asian leaders showered Trump with praise and gifts during his last visit to the region. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi promised to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize, and South Korean President Lee Jang Myung gave Trump a literal golden crown. That didn't stop Trump from tariffing Japan into an economic contraction and extracting a $350 billion ransom from South Korea to avoid the same fate.\n\nContrast that with Mexico and Canada, two small countries in America's shadow. Early in his second term, Trump announced blanket tariffs against both of them. He accused Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum of allying with gangsters and even threatened to annex Canada. Rather than trying to appease the U.S. president, Mexico and Canada immediately hit back with tariffs of their own. Ontario, the province of Canada with the most to lose, struck a daredevil tone.\n\n\"If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do anything, including cutting off their energy—with a smile on my face,\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said at a press conference. \"They need to feel the pain.\"\n\nTrump ended up softening and delaying the tariff increases on Mexico and Canada. Just this weekend, he blew through a self-imposed deadline to tariff Canada, which Trump had announced in retaliation for Ford taking out an anti-tariff ad. And he hasn't followed through on his threats to expand the drug war by bombing Mexico. Sheinbaum, a left-wing leader who has declared that Mexicans will \"never bow our heads\" to America, enjoys a strangely warm relationship with Trump.\n\n\"You're tough,\" Trump told Sheinbaum during a private March 2025 phone call, adding in public that he would suspend tariffs \"out of respect\" for his \"very good\" relationship with Sheinbaum.\n\nMamdani, who has threatened to block Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, clearly benefited from the same respect for strength. Despite the huge leverage that the federal government holds over New York City, the mayor-elect came out swinging. He promised in his victory speech to be \"Trump's worst nightmare\" and \"show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him.\"\n\nIt looked a lot more serious than Trump's other domestic opposition. At the beginning of the second Trump administration, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D–N.Y.) had whimpered, \"It's their government. What leverage do we have?\" The same week that Mamdani was reading his followers for confrontation, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D–N.Y.) was surrendering to Republicans on the government shutdown while begging them to see the light of reason. So it shouldn't be much of a surprise that Trump treated Mamdani as an equal and heaped contempt on Schumer.\n\nOf course, personal respect from Trump is not enough to totally derail a hostile agenda. Mexico and Canada still suffered from some tariff increases. And the risk of bluster is having to back it up. Mamdani and Trump still have substantive, zero-sum disagreements that will force them to fight.\n\nBut even if resistance has its downsides, grovelling clearly does not work. European and Asian leaders have thrown away a strong hand by preemptively signalling their intent to surrender. Mexico and Canada's leaders avoided the worst outcome by playing a weak hand with strength. In a palace full of sycophants, the way to win the king's respect is with defiance.",

        "text": "As the sane residents of New York City await (no doubt with bated breath) the mayoralty of stated Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani, a senseless Saturday attack on a subway rider starkly illustrated the already-dangerous reality of out-of-control violent crime in America's once-premier city.\n\nAccording to the NYPD, the 54-year-old straphanger was punched in the face, several times, then stabbed in the stomach after asking another passenger to talk more quietly on his cellphone.\n\nThe attacker jumped off the train at the station and was on the loose, police told the NY Post, while the victim was taken to Jamaica Hospital in stable condition. The attack occurred aboard an E train at the Jamaica Center–Parsons/Archer station in Queens around 11 a.m., police said.\n\nHere's more:\n\nThe attack comes a day after a homeless man was arrested for allegedly slashing two men in their faces in a caught-on-video outburst on a busy subway platform in Queens last week.Tyquan Manassa, 28, was charged Friday in connection to the Wednesday afternoon attacks on the two men on the southbound platform of the E and F train at the Union Turnpike station in Kew Gardens, the NYPD said.Manassa was identified as the stabbing suspect after cops busted him for a separate, unhinged outburst at the Ward’s Island shelter where he’d been staying Thursday, sources said.\n\nIn other words, business as usual in the Big Apple.\n\nALSO CHECK OUT: The Downfall of America's Cities: Crime Reporting vs. Crime Victimization\n\nDeSantis Makes Impassioned Pitch Directly to NYC Police Officers Ahead of Probable Mamdani Mayoral Win\n\nIn a follow-up interview with the Post, the victim’s daughter said the NYC subway system needs a stronger police presence:\n\nThey’re supposed to be on the station. I don’t really see them as much anymore. It’s a crazy world we live in.\n\nThe victim's daughter added: “He’s talking, he’s eating, he’s good.\"\n\nAccording to the outlet, the victim, a waiter, was \"heading home from his restaurant gig\" when the senseless attack occurred.\n\nSubway rider, 18-year-old Fatima Shahid, also spoke with the Post about subway violence in the city:\n\nUnfortunately, I feel like it happens so often that it’s kind of like we’re desensitized to it. It does make me feel a little unsafe. I’m glad that I don’t take the train as often as I used to. ... So I feel a little OK, but I know that somebody who does it every day would be scared and feel unsafe.\n\nA 37-year-old man who identified himself as Perry said he was surprised by the stabbing:\n\nNo, this is not normal, and not what I’ve heard or seen before. Just hearing this is crazy.\n\nNormal, or not, what are the chances of subway violence — make that overall violence — decreasing in NYC after Mamdani takes office on January 1? After all, we're talking about a left-wing extremist who wants to deploy social workers instead of police officers to respond to 911 calls. \n\nJust one problem: the controversial plan has already been operating in the Big Apple on a small scale, and is failing miserably:\n\nThe early results of a program dubbed B-HEARD spell trouble for Mamdani’s proposed $1.1 billion Department of Community Safety (DCS), a signature initiative that his newly announced chief of staff and left-hand woman, Elle Bisgaard-Church, helped craft.B-HEARD launched in 2021 as a pilot program and only operates in some city neighborhoods, but a bleak audit conducted in May by the city comptroller found it was limping — with a whopping 60% of calls deemed ineligible while more than 35% of eligible calls from mental health professionals never got a response.“Calls were considered potentially dangerous, were ineligible because a mental health professional was already at the scene, or were unable to be triaged because FDNY EMS did not take the call or all necessary information could not be collected about the person in distress,” the comptroller’s office wrote in a news release at the time.\n\nSo, yeah, raise your hand if you think crime will worsen in New York City after Mamdani ushers in his socialist (read: Marxist) mentality to respond to potentially dangerous and violent crimes. \n\nJust as I thought.\n\nNote: Do you enjoy RedState’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

Kathy Hochul on Monday touted her advice to Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani as helping lead to his surprisingly cordial meeting with President Trump – and possibly protecting the Big Apple from federal intervention.\n\nHochul revealed she talked to Mamdani before Friday’s high-stakes White House sitdown and told him he needed to ensure Trump had “confidence” in his leadership to keep the president from sending the National Guard into New York City.\n\n“He has already hit the ground running,” she said of Mamdani. “And I have the confidence in him that I wanted the president to have as well: that we don’t need any interventions.”\n\nThe face-to-face between Mamdani and Trump led to a surreal spectacle in the Oval Office, in which a clearly impressed president lauded the democratic socialist upstart who unapologetically called him a “fascist.”\n\nTrump even backed off his threat to send the National Guard because Mamdani convinced him of his commitment to keeping crime down, in part by retaining NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch.\n\n“I expect to be helping him, not hurting him, a big help because I want New York City to be great,” Trump said.\n\nHochul said she also told Mamdani to focus on areas of potential collaboration with Trump, citing her own talks with the president that led the feds to take over the long-stalled Penn Station revamp.\n\nThe governor wouldn’t go so far as to say that Trump won’t resurrect – and follow through – on his threat to cut off federal funding for New York City.\n\n“But I believe we are in a better place this Monday [than] we were Friday going into that meeting,” she said, during an unrelated press conference in The Bronx.\n\n“The president had a chance to see someone as I have – who has the capacity and the vision that the city needs at this time.”\n\nMamdani called Hochul the day after the meeting to “extend his appreciation” for the advice, the governor said.\n\n“I told him I thought he did everything he needed to do to make sure the president has confidence in his leadership,” she said.",

The duo looked relatively cordial with each other and also completed the press conference without taking any potshots at each other.\n\nThis was despite the President and Mamdani coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum.

He said on-air shortly after the meeting between Donald Trump and Zohran Mamdani, saying, “There you go, that’s what we just watched. I think JD Vance is jealous. I think the president wants to use him as a running mate. They really got along fantastic.”\n\nHowever, Vance appeared unaffected, sharing an X post featuring a press conference highlight where a reporter questioned Mamdani about his past comment calling the President a “fascist.”\n\nPOTUS has a lot of good moments, but this is an all-timer https://t.co/Ge0vYEiJhP\n— JD Vance (@JDVance) November 21, 2025\n\nA visibly flustered Zohran could be seen trying to deflect the question, but Trump jokingly told him just to go ahead and say it again in front of the media, too. The moment prompted laughter from reporters.\n\nSharing the same, JD Vance captioned the video, stating, “POTUS has a lot of good moments, but this is an all-timer.” For content, contrary to public opinion, both the president and the New York City mayor described their banter as rather positive.\n\nTrump and Mamdani revealed that they discussed various key issues facing New York, including affordability, immigration, the Middle East, crime rates, and housing costs. Surprisingly, the two declined to answer all questions about their past negative opinions of each other.\n\nNot only that, Donald Trump revealed that he would feel comfortable living in New York City with Zohran Mamdani as mayor. Many users quickly reacted to JD Vance’s post, highlighting the light moment between the duo in the White House press conference.\n\nOne user wrote, “Aww, they are bonding.” Another wrote, “It’s pretty funny seeing Trump say ‘just say yes.’ Definitely made me laugh out loud.” However, a netizen took a jab at Vance and commented, “Bro was not invited.”\n\n​However, in his later interview, Mamdani stood by his view that he indeed thinks that the president is a fascist. During an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, the newly elected NYC mayor was asked whether he stands by his previous statement on Trump, despite their cordial meeting.\n\nTo this, Mamdani responded, “Everything that I’ve said in the past I continue to believe. I think it is important in our politics that we don’t shy away from where we have disagreements.”",

        "text": "The defining moment of Zohran Mamdani’s Friday meeting with Donald Trump was plain to see. It was when the tough-talking commie was asked by a reporter if he still stood by his tiresome campaign claims that the American president is a fascist.\n\nFor one, Mamdani and his fellow leftists don’t even know what a fascist is. But we do, and wethinks we see an awful lot of projection here.\n\nFor two, Mamdani won the New York City mayor’s race by preaching about affordability (read: “affordability”) and by fulminating about the fascist-in-chief in the White House. And during his victory speech, he sneeringly said to the American president, “So Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up!”\n\nSurely, then, when asked about it directly, Florida’s Realtor of the Year would stand up to the vile Trump and double down on his fascist charge, right? Surely, he’d fulfill the hopes and dreams of his Trump-deranged legions by speaking truth to power right there in the Oval Office, right?\n\nWrong. And don’t call him Shirley, even if he can’t knock out a single sorry rep at 135.\n\n“Are you affirming that you think President Trump is a fascist?” came the question from Fox News White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich — a question calling for a simple yes-or-no answer, a question to which Mamdani manfully replied, “I’ve spoken about the…”\n\nTrump immediately stepped in to rescue Mamdani: “That’s okay, you can just say, ‘Yes,’” said Trump with a smile and a dismissive wave of the hand and a couple of pats on Mamdani’s arm. “Go ahead. It’s easier — it’s easier than explaining it. I don’t mind.”\n\nThis was pure Trump, who, despite his well-earned reputation as a political street-fighter, is at his essence a fine host and a gentleman. He recognized immediately that the question put his guest in a tough spot, and he defused it by making light of it. The moment had the makings of a great ambush: Fox News reporter, tough question, star-struck visitor to the Oval Office. And a lesser man — yours truly, for example — would’ve made Mamdani squirm, especially after all the vile things he’d been saying. But not Trump. He was magnanimous.\n\nThis isn’t meant to make light of this dirty little demagogue’s name-calling because it’s deadly serious stuff. Were it not, Charlie Kirk’s leftist assassin wouldn’t have etched “Hey fascist! Catch!” into one of his bullet casings.\n\nThe Democrat Party’s behavior, generally, has become diseased by coarseness, crudity, and incivility as it tries to one-up Donald Trump’s straight talk and toughness. It won’t work, though, because whereas Trump is an utterly authentic throat-puncher, the Democrats to a person are not. So when an opportunistic insurrectionist like Senator Elissa Slotkin tells her colleagues to “get a little more alpha energy,” and when milquetoasts like Chuck Schumer and Chris Murphy are dropping F-bombs in X posts, and when elite prep-schoolers like Jasmine Crockett are talkin’ like they’s from the ‘hood, you know that in addition to being unmoored, even unhinged, these people are also trying to be something they’re not: tough. Think about it: The toughest guys in the Democrat Party are the women.\n\nAfterward, Trump was even more generous: “I feel very confident that he can do a good job,” said Trump about his guest. “I think he is going to surprise some conservative people, actually. … We agree on a lot more than I would have thought.”\n\nSo this brief snapshot in time spoke volumes about Trump, but it also spoke volumes about that simpering little two-faced commie Mamdani.\n\nOver the weekend, on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Mamdani told moderator Kristen Welker that he still thinks Trump is a fascist. “After President Trump said that, I said, 'Yes,’” Mamdani insisted, adding, “That’s something I’ve said in the past, and I say today. And I think what I appreciated about the conversation that I had with the president was that we were not shy about the places of disagreement, about the politics that has brought us to this moment, and we also wanted to focus on what it could look like to deliver on a shared analysis of an affordability crisis for New Yorkers.”\n\nTrump throws the guy a lifeline and signals a willingness to help beleaguered New York City, and this little weakling stabs him in the back.\n\nThat’s all you need to know about commies. And Trump-deranged Democrats.",

        "text": "FIRST ON FOX: A Senate Republican wants to take a legislative shot at New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and his desire to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Sen. Ted Budd, R-N.C., is introducing legislation that would halt some funding to cities that follow through on any International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant to arrest or detain officials from North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries. The measure, called the \"American Allies Protection Act,\" is in direct response to Mamdani doubling down on his vow to arrest Netanyahu. Last year, the ICC issued a warrant for the Israeli prime minister’s arrest that has been heavily scrutinized by lawmakers in the U.S. and abroad. ADL CHIEF WARNS NYC MAYOR-ELECT ZOHRAN MAMDANI POSES A 'CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER' TO JEWISH COMMUNITY Mamdani reiterated his desire to arrest Netanyahu last week before meeting with President Donald Trump. He told local news station ABC7 that New York City was a \"city of international law\" that would uphold the court’s arrest warrants, which accused the Israeli prime minister of intentionally attacking civilians and using starvation as a method of warfare. \"I’ve said time and again that I believe this is a city of international law, and being a city of international law means looking to uphold international law,\" he said. \"And that means upholding the warrants from the International Criminal Court, whether they’re for Benjamin Netanyahu or Vladimir Putin.\" TRUMP REVEALS 'ONE THING IN COMMON' HE HAS WITH MAMDANI AFTER OVAL OFFICE LOVE FEST Budd charged in a statement to Fox News Digital that the U.S. is \"not bound by the morally bankrupt\" court, and accused Mamdani’s position and comments of not being based in law but rather a means to \"virtue-signal to his radical, anti-Israel base.\" \"Mayor-elect Mamdani’s pledge to facilitate the arrest of Benjamin Netanyahu is not just ridiculous; it represents a grave threat that could seriously damage America’s relationship with our closest allies and partners,\" Budd said. LEAVITT DOESN'T MINCE WORDS AHEAD OF MAMDANI-TRUMP MEETING: 'COMMUNIST COMING TO THE WHITE HOUSE' His legislation would halt Department of Justice (DOJ) grants from flowing to any city that cooperates with the court and arrests a NATO or U.S. major non-NATO ally. There is an override mechanism built in that would allow the president to end the penalty only if cooperation with the court is deemed necessary for national security.

When asked if there was discussion of stopping Mamdani from arresting Netanyahu, Trump said the pair, \"Didn’t discuss\" the matter.",

        "text": "The proposal would require a minimum premium payment and limit eligibility for the subsidies, which come in the form of tax credits, to enrollees with income up to 700% of the federal poverty line, the report said. \n\nThe administration is also seeking an option that would let enrollees to get part of their tax credit through a savings account, according to Politico. That’s after Trump had suggested earlier that consumers receive subsidies directly.\n\nThe White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of insurer Centene, which is a top participant in public health exchanges, jumped 8% on Monday, Molina Healthcare rallied 5%, and Oscar Health soared 24%.\n\nWithout an extension of the subsidies, consumers who buy policies on the ACA marketplace would see insurance premiums more than double on average. Millions of Americans have already gotten sticker shock as open enrollment for 2026 began earlier this month.\n\nThe subsidies were at the center of the longest government shutdown in history as Democrats pushed to renew the COVID-era aid, while Republicans and the White House insisted on letting them expire at year’s end. The shutdown ended without a renewal, with Democrats only getting a promise for a vote in the Senate.\n\nBut the GOP’s stunning losses in this month’s off-year elections highlighted affordability as a top voter concern. Since then, Trump has rolled back tariffs hitting groceries, floated a $2,000 tariff “dividend” payment, and backed an idea for a 50-year mortgage meant to lower monthly payments.\n\nTrump’s Oval Office meeting on Friday with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, was also surprisingly friendly as the president emphasized their common ground on improving affordability rather than wide ideological differences. \n\nA two-year extension for the subsidies would notably stretch beyond next year’s midterm elections, potentially giving Republicans some political cover amid fears of a Democratic wave.\n\nLetting them expire, however, would risk significant voter backlash in GOP strongholds, as more than half of the 24 million enrollees receiving the subsidies live in a handful of Southern states.\n\nA KFF analysis last month of ACA marketplace data found 57% of enrollees live in congressional districts represented by a Republican.\n\nIn fact, all congressional districts in Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina have at least 10% of their populations enrolled in ACA plans, according to KFF. That goes for nearly all districts in Texas and Utah.\n\n“While a relatively small share of the national population gets their coverage through the ACA Marketplaces, in some districts, the number of ACA enrollees could be enough to swing a close election,” KFF said last month.",

        "text": "Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert comic strip, recently shared an extraordinary personal story that reveals a side of Donald Trump most people never see and the left certainly doesn’t want to acknowledge. Adams recounted sitting at home in his La-Z-Boy chair, watching a video of Trump just after he met with Zohran Mamdani in the Oval Office. As he listened to Trump on his phone, the call came: the president himself was calling Adams from West Palm Beach.\n\n\"Yes, the president called me while I was watching the president on TV,\" Adams said, as if stunned by the surreal nature of it all. Trump called to check on how Adams was doing with his medical situation. \n\nAdams emphasized how unbelievable this was, saying, \"You cannot get used to that. There’s no way your brain can actually process it, that you’re sitting at home, you’re literally watching the most powerful, in my opinion, and successful president in the history of all humankind... And then the real one calls me while I’m sitting there.\" He was dumbfounded, stating plainly, \"It’s just mind-blowing.\"\n\nNot only did Trump call him once, but he called twice. Adams admitted he missed the first call but made sure to return it.\n\nAnd the affection and concern from Trump didn’t stop there. Dr. Mehmet Oz also called Adams to check on him, ensuring Adams was receiving quality healthcare.\n\nAdams acknowledged that some might accuse him of leveraging his connections for special treatment, but he dismissed those suspicions: \"I’m not aware of any special things outside of the boundaries of my healthcare that I’m getting. But I’m definitely getting the, getting a good version of it.\"\n\n🚨NEW: @ScottAdamsSays reveals Trump & Dr. Oz both called to check in on him yesterday🤯\"Trump called just to make sure I was doing okay and I was getting the help I needed for my medical situation. He followed up. My God.\"\"I will never get used to that! There's no way your… pic.twitter.com/UyWVvW7kPb— Jason Cohen 🇺🇸 (@JasonJournoDC) November 22, 2025\n\nThe reason I’m sharing this story, of course, is because it paints Trump not as the caricature the left enjoys portraying but as a deeply engaged and caring individual, especially toward those loyal to him. From Adams' account, Trump is someone who personally follows up. This story reveals a side of Trump both extraordinary and personal, a side that clashes with the popular narrative but one that Adams insists is real.\n\nAdams revealed earlier this year that he was battling metastatic prostate cancer and had a prognosis of just months to live.\n\n\"I have the same cancer that Joe Biden has. I also have prostate cancer that has also spread to my bones, but I've had it longer than he's had it — well, longer than he's admitted having it,\" Adams said. \"I expect to be checking out from this domain sometime this summer.\"\n\nThankfully, his fight has continued longer than his prediction.\n\nUltimately, Adams' story isn’t just about a phone call. It’s about witnessing America's most powerful man as a real person who reaches out in moments of human need—something most Americans don’t get to see, and the political left certainly doesn’t want to admit.\n\nWant to support fearless journalism that exposes the Left and tells the stories the media won’t?

It’s easier than explaining. I don’t mind.”More: Mamdani noted in the interview that aired on Sunday that – after Trump made the jab – he said \"yes,\" to the reporter's question.\"That’s something I’ve said in the past (and) I say it today,\" Mamdani said.More: More: While different definitions abound, many experts agree that fascism is an extreme combination of nationalism and militarism, often accompanied by a cult of personality surrounding a leader.The \"Meet the Press\" appearance was Mamdani's first national interview since the White House meeting, which captured public attention for the pair's chummy, positive attitudes after months of trading blows. Trump has blasted the incoming mayor in several social media posts, calling him a communist and \"nut job\" in the lead-up to his overwhelming Election Day victory.Though Mamdani said he hasn't changed his mind on the president's positions, he still said he's hopeful they can work together to address affordability. The costs of housing, childcare and groceries were central to Mamdani's successful campaign.\"What I appreciated about the conversation that I had with the president was that we were not shy about the places of disagreement, about the politics that has brought us to this moment,\" Mamdani said of Trump. \"And we also wanted to focus on what it could look like to deliver on a shared analysis of an affordability crisis for New Yorkers,” he said.Kathryn Palmer is a politics reporter for USA TODAY.

        "text": "Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said that the key to his recent successful closed door meeting with President Donald Trump was a shared interest in the cost of living and making the city better.\n\n“Too often, when two politicians meet, the conversation rarely extends beyond them,” Mamdani said Sunday at a news conference outside of Union Grove Missionary Baptist Church in the Bronx. “And what we found instead is that this was a conversation that was productive, a conversation that was focused on New York City and a conversation that looks to deliver for the people of New York City.”\n\nMamdani said he was “feeling good” in his first appearance back in New York City since his trip to the nation’s capital. \n\nPoliticians across the country, analysts and local New Yorkers reacted with surprise to the nature of the two leaders' meeting that appeared cordial and friendly. Some opined on social media that Mamdani had ‘won’ the meeting, while others said Trump did.\n\n“I think it was New Yorkers that won in this conversation. It was a conversation that came back again and again to the people of the city,” Mamdani said.\n\nMamdani’s return to the city comes just over a month before he is set to be sworn in to City Hall, leaving future questions looming about Trump’s involvement in local affairs once he takes office. The Trump administration has previously threatened to withhold critical federal funding for the Hudson River tunnels project and the Second Avenue Subway extension, and deploy National Guard troops to address perceived crime. \n\nMamdani said earlier in the morning on an appearance on “Meet The Press” that he told Trump there is no need to deploy the National Guard to New York, like he has in other cities. \n\n“What I told him is that what separates New York City from anywhere else in the country is that we have the NYPD. And I trust the NYPD to deliver public safety,” Mamdani said. “And, to me, that is something that I know they can do, have done and will continue to do under my leadership.\"\n\nPresident Trump said on Saturday that he would send the National Guard to the city if he felt it was needed, but other places need it more right now. \n\nBut the mayor-elect said he’s confident that the federal government will help in the effort to improve life in the city — but still acknowledged key differences on the issues of immigration.\n\n“I’ll let the president speak for himself,” Mamdani said when asked about Trump believing ICE hasn’t done enough in the city yet. “ There may be disagreements between the president and myself, and they will continue to be, and I will always make the case for each and every person that calls the City Hall.”",

        "text": "In one respect, New York City’s unusual election results this year fit a national pattern: Voters opted to make housing easier and faster to build. Here’s hoping it’s a trend that lasts.\n\nA lack of housing has become a nationwide problem. High prices and mortgage rates have depressed sales. With rent costs outpacing incomes, nearly half the nation’s growing population of renters pays more than 30% of their income on housing. In New York, the rental vacancy rate has plummeted to 1.4% and the homeless population has soared.\n\nAt long last, voters seem to be waking up to a problem that research identified decades ago: Policies that protect existing homeowners and other local interests have restricted development and driven up costs. New Yorkers voted to speed up reviews of affordable housing and other modest projects and weaken local council members’ veto power. A zoning reform last year, the city’s biggest since 1961, followed similar proposals in fast-growing cities such as Austin and Minneapolis. California’s governor is overriding mayoral opposition to apartment construction in Los Angeles.\n\nSuch measures could provide local leaders with a historic opportunity. New York, by some estimates, needs to build as many as 50,000 units a year, well above its recent pace, to make up for decades of underdevelopment. There are already signs of progress: In the third quarter, developers filed proposals for 11,746 new residential units citywide, 162% higher than the average since 2008. Conversions of vacant office space could produce 17,000 more.\n\nYet zoning limits and sluggish land-use reviews aren’t the only obstacles. Successfully addressing the housing shortage will require cities to work with state governments and the private sector to prioritize home construction - and occasionally to override competing interests.\n\nHere New York offers several examples of what not to do. One needless constraint is an affordable-housing tax-incentive program passed by the state last year, which imposes higher construction wages and below-market-rent requirements on buildings with 100 units or more. Unsurprisingly, the city has since seen a surge in towers with precisely 99 apartments. The goal should be to reward more units, not to punish them.\n\nSimilarly, affordable rents require keeping landlords’ costs low. Yet New York’s convoluted property-tax system levies higher rates on large apartment buildings than on single-family homes, thus discouraging density and penalizing renters when the costs are passed on. The state’s unique scaffold law imposes absolute liability on owners and contractors for “gravity-related” worker injuries, thereby inflating insurance, construction and maintenance costs. (A recent study found insurance costs for rent-stabilized apartments climbed 150% from 2019 to 2025.) Nearly every US state is plagued by similarly costly impediments; eliminating them should be a national priority.\n\nFinally, with fewer than half of New York City’s rental units available on the free market, fierce competition keeps rents at near records. Freezing rents for the rest, as Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has promised, will only reduce landlords’ capacity to invest in upkeep and drive more properties into financial distress. (A survey of landlords last year found that more than 25,000 rent-stabilized apartments were vacant because their owners couldn’t afford to renovate.) Instead, providing more owners with a gradual path to deregulated rents would give them an incentive to upgrade - and to develop more properties.\n\nIf New York were to finally raze some of its homegrown obstacles, perhaps states such as California might revisit the myriad policies - such as decades-old property-tax limits - that benefit homeowners at the expense of new buyers and builders. Another housing boom, for New York and for the nation, is long overdue.\n\nThe Editorial Board publishes the views of the editors across a range of national and global affairs.",

        "text": "For most normal people, the likelihood of adding a real-deal Cartier Crash to their collection is next to nothing. Sure, it could happen, but between the Crash’s scarcity and the six-figure price tags they generally fetch at auctions, those odds are pretty slim. Still, the Salvador Dali-looking watch has developed a massive following in the scene. Whether collectors opt for a watch actually designed by the Spanish artist or turn to burgeoning independents clearly inspired by the watch’s unusual curves, the appetite for the Crash is hardly slowing down. This month, an independent brand is launching one of the coolest and most inventive takes on the Crash yet—all in a super-affordable package.\nStreetwear brand Open Bar Funeral is the brainchild of Mark Nguyen and specializes in boxy sizing, flowy fits (I wear their pleated carpenter pants several days a week). Like many brands that specialize in streetwear, though, the temptation to make a wristwatch proved too strong—especially with an idea this good.\nOBF’s inaugural watch is the “Crashio,” which combines the aesthetic of the Cartier Crash with the digital watches made famous by Casio. The timepiece features a 27x46.5mm resin case with a matching stainless steel Jubilee-style bracelet. The digital face sports a 12/24 date format and an auto-calendar, a backlit display, plus daily and hourly alarm capabilities. And, in a particularly inspired touch, the digital display is also warped to match the shape of the case. Accurate to +30 seconds a month and with a seven-year CR2016 battery life, it’s a stylish steal at a retail rate of just $128.\nMaking an impression in a crowded watch space—especially just after a bunch of noisy (and largely expensive) reveals at Dubai Watch Week—is no small feat, especially if a brand is making an effort to break into the market for the first time. Open Bar Funeral’s approach, in turn, is refreshing. Rather than overcomplicating things or starting too small, they’re working with reliable influences—Cartier, the Crash craze, and simple digital pieces beloved by everyone from your dad to Zohran Mamdani—to create something any watch fan can tell you is going to sell out quick. Speaking of which, mark your calendars: the Open Bar Funeral ‘Crashio’ watch goes on sale 11/28.",

        "text": "In January, both ends of City Hall will be under new leadership.\n\nThe voters chose Zohran Mamdani as the city’s next chief executive. He will run the mayor’s side of the oldest functioning City Hall in the country.\n\nThe members of the City Council, however, will elect a new speaker, who will lead the city’s legislature from the building’s opposite wing.\n\nAhead of that January vote, the neck-and-neck front-runners are Julie Menin, an Upper East Side establishment Democrat considered a relative moderate, and the progressive Crystal Hudson of Brooklyn, the mayor-elect’s ideological fellow traveler. \n\nWhile not nearly as prominent as the mayor, the speaker holds significant power over the direction of the city government.\n\nShe or he decides which of the hundreds of bills pending in the council come before the body for a vote.\n\nThe speaker also appoints the chairs of the committees in which those bills originate, who have the power to oversee and investigate city agencies.\n\nIf Hudson is elected, she will bring up bills that advance the agenda of her progressive base.\n\nFor example, City Council leftists, including its Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) members, are determined to pass the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act (COPA).\n\nThis proposed local law would force any owner selling a building with three or more units to notify the city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development and share information about the building’s finances before listing it for sale.\n\nOwners would then have to give qualified nonprofits an exclusive 120-day window to make offers on the building — during which they’d be prohibited from selling to an individual or a “for-profit” entity.\n\nWorse, the HPD commissioner can extend this period, placing even more pressure on financially strapped owners to sell to a nonprofit.\n\nThe measure may well be unconstitutional, but DSA-style progressives will deploy it to push favored not-for-profit companies — many of which depend on the council for funding — to become primary owners of city residential real estate.\n\nTheir misguided worldview assumes these quasi-governmental landlords are superior to the small, family-based businesses that own a large share of the outer boroughs’ rent-regulated multi-family buildings.\n\nUnder Speaker Hudson, a radical, anti-private property, anti-business measure like COPA is likely to reach the council floor.\n\nShe could also use her power to foist bad policy upon the mayor.\n\nWhen Mayor Eric Adams refused to run the NYPD according to the progressives’ preferences, the council passed the How Many Stops law to require officers to fill out reams of paperwork describing their interactions with the public.\n\nIf, for example, Mamdani takes the advice of Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch and abandons his promises to disband the NYPD’s Strategic Response Unit and suppress its gang database, Speaker Hudson could push legislation that bans the unit and dismantles the database.\n\nIn doing so, she’d override the police commissioner and corner Mamdani between his ideological campaign promises and the real-life demands of public safety. \n\nOnly the speaker has the prerogative to prevent the worst bills from reaching a vote.\n\nIf she chooses not to, she can place the new mayor in a very difficult position — forcing him to choose between prudential governance, supported by a broad consensus, and the ideological dreams of his far-left allies.\n\nConversely, a Speaker Menin could bottle up the DSA’s legislative disasters, shielding the mayor from his own bad ideas and giving him the room he needs to govern in a more moderate and effective way.\n\nMamdani may already perceive the need for such a built-in check.\n\nNot only has he retained Tisch, he has also refused to support City Councilman Chi Ossé’s primary bid against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY).\n\nAnd in contrast to his aggressive victory speech, Mamdani’s visit with President Trump on Friday was remarkably measured, even genial.\n\nThe mayor-elect seems to understand that he can’t succeed amid ceaseless anxiety over public safety and in a perpetual war with non-DSA Democrats.\n\nIf he wants to be an effective mayor, Mamdani must transform himself from outside agitator railing against the system to a wise manager of that very system.\n\nWhile Hudson appears to be his natural ally and ideological companion, Mamdani’s mayoralty could sink under the weight of an overactive, radical City Council that places him under constant leftist political pressure.\n\nA partnership with the older, more experienced Menin — who, incidentally, is Jewish — would offer balance at the grand staircase that stands as the fulcrum between the two wings of City Hall.\n\nWith a race that can tip either way, the speakership will decide whether New York’s next mayor starts off on a steady footing — or begins to slip with his first step.\n\nChristian Browne is an attorney and adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, where John Ketcham is director of cities and a legal policy fellow.",

Ian Wright here,” the 62-year-old ex-striker’s message began. “I just want to say a massive, massive congratulations on what you’ve achieved. The real work starts now, but God willing, you can achieve everything that you have set out to achieve.”\n\nA visibly stunned Mamdani, 34, sputtered “What?” as the video began, then directed an “I love you” at Wright’s image on the screen.\n\nWright concluded his message by telling Mamdani that his favorite soccer team was “gonna need some of that winning energy that you’ve got, my friend, and get behind the boys. It’s a long way to go, just have to stay calm, back [manager] Mikel [Arteta], and all the boys.\n\n“Up the Gunners, baby. Take it easy and God bless, my friend.”\n\n“I’m gonna watch it again,” Mamdani told Friedland after the message from Wright ended. “I love this man.”\n\nThe surprise wrapped up a happy weekend for Mamdani, whose beloved Gunners defeated local rivals Tottenham Hotspur, 4-1, earlier Sunday to move six points clear in England’s top division.\n\nThat result followed an unexpectedly warm meeting at the White House between Mamdani and President Trump, during which the commander-in-chief said he would be “cheering” for the Democratic socialist to “really do something great for New York.”",

        "text": "Resurfaced warnings from the late Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk about the dangers of young Americans embracing socialism are drawing new attention after New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, met with President Donald Trump at the White House. \"How do we get more young people under the age of 35 to have equity in the system? Not the Democrat version of equity, where they want to have redistribution, but actually, are they paying a mortgage? Do they own stuff? Or are they permanent renters?\" Kirk asked during a July 11 appearance on \"Fox & Friends.\" TRUMP PREDICTS 'CIVIL' MEETING WITH MAMDANI DESPITE PAST COMMENTS ABOUT EACH OTHER \"A permanent renting class in this country is the prerequisite, is the leading ingredient for radical politics that nobody wants to see,\" he continued. \"We need to reinvigorate the ownership economy. And then all of a sudden, when you own stuff, you're less likely to burn down Wendy's and vote for candidates like Zohran Mamdani.\" GOP WARNED TO TAKE ACTION OR 'LOSE' GEN Z VOTERS AFTER MAMDANI WINS NYC MAYOR RACE Later that day, speaking at the Turning Point USA Summit in Tampa, Florida, Kirk doubled down on his warning, taking aim at Mamdani’s push for city-run grocery stores and his previously espoused defund the police rhetoric. \"All that is garbage,\" Kirk said. \"But we failed to understand why he is rising… a part of it is that people in New York are not like you wonderful people here in Florida… But there's a deeper thing at play… Younger voters are trying to get their leaders' attention. We can't afford anything.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Kirk’s comments resurfaced on Monday’s \"Fox & Friends\" broadcast on the heels of Mamdani and President Donald Trump holding a cordial meeting at the White House to discuss the affordability crisis, public safety and the challenges facing New Yorkers. Mamdani, on Sunday, called it important that people in politics don't shy away from areas with disagreements, all while understanding that such issues \"[bring] us to the table.\" Co-host Brian Kilmeade emphasized recent Fox News polling showing three quarters of voters view the economy negatively and continue to be concerned about affordability. Grocery costs are a particular pain point for voters, as the poll asked if costs for items have increased, decreased or remained the same compared to a year ago. An 85% majority said they've increased, whereas 10% reported a decrease and 5% said there's been no change.",

        "text": "Donald Trump‘s fashion has become the latest topic of gossip among onlookers. The 79-year-old, who has otherwise mostly hogged the limelight over his political manoeuvring, has now surprised everyone. Well, netizens are even questioning if his latest meeting with New York’s recently elected mayor, Zohran Mamdani, at the White House might have influenced his sense of style.\n\nThe duo’s recent meeting grabbed attention because there was no awkwardness between them. The U.S. President even felt comfortable with the incoming mayor tagging him as a fascist publicly in front of numerous cameras.\n\nThe next day after the meeting, Trump was spotted wearing an oversized black overcoat, given the recent drop in temperatures. He added a deep red scarf around his neck, which further enhanced the impression of a totally new, never-before-seen outfit for the American President. So much so that people have been taken aback by his latest look, stopping to stare as he made his way toward Marine One. Trump even addressed the press wearing the same kind of outfit, which is totally unlike his usual wardrobe choices. Naturally, this new fad has left the internet abuzz with questions.\n\nDonald Trump has had a surprisingly cordial meeting with New York City-mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, despite their very different political ideologies.\n\n— KORNERSTONE (@Kornerstone4) November 24, 2025\n\nAs Donald Trump’s pictures and videos of his latest winter-approved look surfaced, netizens began expressing their opinions without a thought. One of the most apparent observations has definitely been how the President’s outfit deeply resembled Zohran Mamdani‘s signature look. One of the netizens wrote, “Looks like the old man took some fashion tips from Mamdani, too,” while another user commented, “Well, I declare, Donald Trump in a red turtleneck looking like he’s fixing to join the country club! Bless his heart. Y’all think this is the start of a new fashion era?”\n\nSome netizens even compared Trump’s new-age-inspired look in an overcoat and scarf, mocking him for trying to step into millennial-chic winter style and channeling a younger, hipster look. A third user wrote, “Trump strutting in that black full-length coat with the maroon scarf… looks less like a statesman and more like a villain in a winter dystopia.”\n\nWhether a new fashion era, a case of copied inspiration, or just a change of thought, Donald Trump’s latest appearance has everyone buzzing with a lot of assumptions. But the President seems unbothered, just as he was when he interacted with Mamdani in the Oval Office. Even though it was their first face-to-face meeting, there is no evidence to prove that things between the two are not on good terms.\n\nWait until his actions match his words. America has more differences with Mamdani than in common.\n\nTrump on Mamdani Meet: ‘We Agree on More Than I Thought’ https://t.co/4lxA8py1Wr\n— Martster (@Martster2510) November 24, 2025\n\nInterestingly, Mamdani, a 34-year-old, was asked to clarify whether he wished to retract any of his previous statements against Donald Trump. These included terms like “despot” and “fascist,” considering the two of them did have a civil moment recently.\n\nIn response, Mamdani stated, “We are both very clear on our positions and our views, and what I really appreciate about the president is our meeting focused not on places of disagreement but the shared purpose we have.” On the other hand, the U.S. President did not even raise a quizzical brow on the matter. Trump said, “I’ve been called much worse than a despot.” Later on, the POTUS further signaled his inclination toward living in NYC himself while de Blasio was the mayor. He then added, “Yeah, I would, especially after the meeting. Absolutely.”",

        "text": "The government shutdown may be over, but for millions of families across the country, the damage is done. Food assistance was delayed for over 40 million people, health care access has become uncertain for the tens of millions who rely on Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, lines at food pantries have doubled and veterans and active-duty members are waiting for benefits they rely on. Once again, political stunts in Washington have treated people as bargaining chips—a stark reminder that we cannot rely on federal leaders to protect everyday families.\n\nThrough all this, Californians have sent a clear and resounding message: We reject this type of governance. Voters want leaders who protect working families, strengthen public systems and take bold action when Washington fails. November’s elections were more than just a vote—they were a mandate, showing that voters are ready to back measures and candidates who reflect these values.\n\nVolunteers distribute free groceries at a drive-through food distribution event amid the federal government shutdown which caused SNAP/CalFresh food benefits delays on November 20, 2025, in Altadena, California. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)\n\nWhen the federal government flounders, California can step up and demonstrate how government should work: organizing Operation Feed California to support the recipients affected by delayed SNAP benefits, sending an emergency infusion of money to Planned Parenthood after losing federal funding and supporting the thousands of veterans whose jobs were jeopardized when President Donald Trump threatened federal workforce cuts. These actions are not abstract—they have the potential to directly benefit millions of Californians and set a national example for what bold, people-centered governance can look like. And Californians are already putting their values into action. \n\nIn Santa Clara County, voters overwhelmingly approved Measure A, a sales tax increase that county leaders placed on the ballot after it was estimated that President Trump’s cuts to Medicaid and SNAP would reduce county revenues by $1 billion a year by the end of the decade. The measure is set to raise roughly $330 million annually for safety-net programs. Its passage signals that Californians are willing to take concrete steps to protect the services their families rely on, even when federal support is uncertain.\n\nIn Santa Cruz, voters faced a similar choice, with Measure C—a measure designed to fund affordable housing and help prevent homelessness. The measure would double the tax and extend it for 20 years, and was passed by over 54 percent of the vote. \n\nAnd let’s not forget about the major statewide win, Proposition 50. Californians overwhelmingly voted to pass Prop 50, marking a bold step in structural democratic reform, not just for California but as a model for our national future.\n\nThroughout the state, voters rejected far-right extremism—they also rejected complacency.\n\nBut California isn’t alone. Across the country, voters delivered wins for candidates and measures that pushed back against Trump’s countless cuts. From progressive champions like Zohran Mamdani in New York to Democratic governors winning their elections in states like New Jersey and Virginia, the appetite for bold, people-centered governance expands far beyond our state. \n\nThe contrast could not be more evident. On election night, people shifted from feeling hopeless to feeling hopeful, demonstrating that they will choose initiatives and leaders who stand firmly with them. While voters embraced bold action, six Democrats buckled under pressure, abandoning families in need for nothing in return.\n\nIf leaders in Washington fail to match the courage of the people, the hope that they built after the elections may quickly vanish. California cannot allow it. We must seize the moment and continue in the vein of optimism and determination that voters so clearly demanded.\n\nCalifornia has a responsibility to lead. While Washington spirals from crisis to crisis, our state can model a government that works for the people. We’ve already heard from community leaders and organizers in states from Arizona to Georgia that they’re proud of the work California is advancing, while some of their own leaders cave to Trump’s pressure. They see in California a blueprint—proof that courage can win! \n\nBut delivering for voters requires courage from all corners of the Democratic Party. The shutdown may be over, but the lesson is clear—when Washington fails, California is ready to lead. Californians fought hard for the wins on election night. Now it’s our job to fight just as hard for them. Let’s give them what they want and lead the way. \n\nAssemblymember Ash Kalra represents California’s 25th Assembly District, which encompasses the majority of San José, including downtown and open space areas in southeast Santa Clar...",

This is our only way out of the abyss,\" Carville wrote, citing the recent Democratic victories in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City. Carville said Democrats would continue to hold onto urban and suburban voters, but need to reconnect with voters who give Republicans an advantage in rural regions. He said the party needed to stay on message in angrily opposing the \"the unjust economic system\" that has increased utility bills and kept prices high. THE FAR LEFT HAVE TAKEN CONTROL OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY PLATFORM, AND IT'S TURNING VOTERS OFF \"It cannot be said enough: The era of performative woke politics from 2020 to 2024 has left a lasting stain on our brand, particularly with rural voters and male voters. The term Latinx was despised even by many Latino people. Calling folks \"BIPOC\" should have never been a thing. 'Defund the police' was a terrible idea,\" Carville said. \"We can no longer be a party with a whiff of moral absolutism,\" he continued. \"We can correct this only by looking toward the future, always, in every situation possible, and pivoting to a form of economic rage as our response.\" Carville called for a simple message that included increasing the federal minimum wage to $20 per hour, offering \"free public college tuition,\" expanding rural broadband as a public utility, and universal childcare. He cited Americans’ frustration with higher electricity and gas bills.

New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, made free childcare a focal point of his mayoral campaign. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Carville previously called on Democrats to make a \"strategic political retreat\" earlier this year, and argued Republicans would crumble underneath their own weight. \"With no clear leader to voice our opposition and no control in any branch of government, it’s time for Democrats to embark on the most daring political maneuver in the history of our party: roll over and play dead,\" the strategist said in a Times guest essay in February.

Mamdani confirmed his stance on the issue during a speech at a church in the Bronx on Sunday, telling parishioners that he and Trump did not see eye-to-eye on the issue. \"I shared with the president directly that New Yorkers want to follow the laws of our city, and the laws of our city say that, in our sanctuary city policies, city government can be in touch with the federal government on around 170 serious crimes. The concern comes from beyond those crimes, the many New Yorkers who are being arrested, they're being detained, they're being deported for the crime of making a regular court appearance.\" \"My focus as the next mayor of this city is going to be to protect immigrants who call this city their home,\" he added. MAMDANI REVEALS WHICH DEM CITIES ARE 'MODEL FOR HOW TO FIGHT' TRUMP ADMIN IN NYC Reporters pressed Mamdani on the issue during a gaggle outside the church Sunday, but the mayor-elect declined to speculate about how Trump would react to his policies. \"I’ll let the president speak for himself, but I did make very clear that our focus comes back to public safety, delivering for each and every New Yorker and knowing that there may be disagreements between the president and myself, and there will continue to be,\" Mamdani said. \"And I will always make the case for each and every person that calls this city home,\" he added. DAVID MARCUS: MR. MAMDANI GOES TO WASHINGTON BETWEEN ROCK AND HARD PLACE Mamdani's statements come after he and Trump appeared to forge a new path for their relationship as they found common ground on affordability issues and improving conditions in New York.

        "text": "More details and contradictory information emerged over the weekend about a broad, 28-point framework for a prospective Russia-Ukraine peace deal. Initial reporting suggested this was a U.S.-devised plan, which President Donald Trump had given Ukraine until November 27 to accept, but the president said on Saturday that it was not his “final offer” to Ukraine. A bipartisan group of U.S. senators said Saturday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio told them during a conference call that the White House did not propose the deal, and it was—per Angus King—a “wish list of the Russians.” Rubio went on to refute this characterization, and a State Department spokesperson said the claims were “blatantly false.” Rubio and other White House officials met with senior diplomatic and security officials from Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the European Union in Geneva on Sunday to discuss terms, with Rubio describing the summit as the Trump administration’s “most productive and meaningful meeting” with Ukraine this year. When details of the plan first emerged last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the situation in a Friday video address as his country facing the choice of either “losing its dignity or the risk of losing a key partner.” That same day, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russian officials were still waiting for the U.S. to share an official proposal, but that the Kremlin is open to “peace negotiations.” Russian forces launched a drone attack on Ukraine’s Kharkiv region last night, killing at least four. \n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) killed Hezbollah’s military chief of staff, Haytham Tabatabai, during an airstrike yesterday targeting a multi-story building in the Lebanese capital city of Beirut that Israel believed to be housing terrorist infrastructure. On Saturday, the IDF launched strikes against Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip, killing at least five senior members of the terrorist organization, according to the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israeli officials said their forces moved ahead with the strikes after Hamas militants opened fire on Israeli soldiers. Hamas initially told mediators that Israel’s strikes could mean the end of the ongoing truce, but a spokesperson for the terror group disputed that claim later that day. Meanwhile, the Associated Press reported that Netanyahu convened a cabinet meeting to address the rising violence from Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank. On Sunday, Israeli government prosecutors filed terrorism-related criminal charges against one Israeli teenager who allegedly attacked Beit Lid, a Palestinian village in the West Bank.\n\nGOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia announced on Friday that she would resign from Congress, effective January 6, 2026, following public attacks from Trump. In a video message, Greene said she decided to avoid a “hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president we all fought for.” On Saturday, Trump posted on Truth Social that “Marjorie went BAD,” describing his now-former ally as a “traitor.” That same day, Trump told reporters that he “disagreed with her philosophy” but added that Greene is a “nice person.” Greene said in an X post on Sunday that she had no intention of launching a presidential campaign, stating that she “laughed at” such speculation. Greene announced in July that she would not run for governor of Georgia in 2026, but has not commented on the race since then. “If I wanted to run we all know I would win,” she tweeted at the time. “It’s not even debatable.”\n\nNew York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani met with Trump at the White House on Friday, with the discussion surprisingly positive and friendly. The president said he is “very confident that [Mamdani] can do a good job,” adding that the mayor-elect’s tenure may “surprise some conservative people.” The two spoke with reporters from the Oval Office later that day, and, when one reporter asked Mamdani whether he still believed Trump to be a fascist, the president intervened, and stated, “That’s okay, you could just say, ‘Yes,’” adding that “it’s easier than explaining it.” On Sunday, Mamdani said he stood behind his past comments. Talking to the press after the meeting, Trump said he disagreed with Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik’s claim that Mamdani is a “jihadist,” adding that Stefanik—who is currently running for governor of New York—was just “out there campaigning.” Trump had previously threatened to pull federal funding to New York City should Mamdani win the election earlier this month, but White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday that “it feels like he [Trump] doesn’t mean it now,” adding that “we’ll have to wait and see what Mamdani does” and noting that the White House was pleased with Mamdani’s decision to retain the city’s incumbent police commissioner, Jessica Tisch.\n\nGunmen in Nigeria continue to hold hostage 253 students—between 10 and 18 years old—as well as 12 teachers, following their attack on a Catholic school on Friday. They had initially taken 303 children hostage, but 50 escaped captivity on Friday and Saturday. An armed group attacked another church last Wednesday in Nigeria’s western Kwara region, killing two people and also taking hostages. Nigerian officials announced that many public schools will be temporarily closed amid the recent violence. Pope Leo XIV has called for an “immediate release” of all hostages.",

        "text": "In the United States, an unexpected style war has gone viral on social media. where Donald Trump, the current US President, stepped out in a winter look that left many people convinced he was channeling or even copying Zohran Mamdani, New York City's mayor-elect.\n\nBut it is the timing of the pictures right after their first in person meeting at the White House that has only increased the rumours, making jokes, memes, and lively online debate.\n\nA Viral Fashion Moment: Trump Copying Mamdani?\n\nJust a short while after meeting Zohran Mamdani at the White House on November 21, Donald Trump was clicked wearing a burgundy scarf tucked neatly under an oversized black overcoat, and it wasn't the usual Trump winter wardrobe. He looked more refined, more composed and the internet noticed. Moreover, X (formerly Twitter) blew up with side by side comparisons of Trump's new look and Mamdani's previous outfits. As some reports put it, users claimed he was 'copying Zohran Mamdani's style.'\n\nOne popular tweet even joked that 'It's called 'the Mamdani'. Trump dressed up for his crush.' Furthermore, some shared old photos of Mamdani in similar burgundy knits and dark outerwear, playing into the theory that the resemblance was more than coincidental. And others pointed out that a doctored image of Mamdani which was recolored to mimic Trump's look may have helped set the meme making machine in motion as even Obama's picture in a similar outfit was pulled out.\n\nStill, the style going viral is rooted in more than fashion. It comes on the heels of a meeting that many expected to be combative but turned out to be surprisingly warm.\n\nREAD MORE: Why Did Donald Trump Dump £65 Million Into Bonds Since August\n\nTrump Meets Mamdani\n\nThe meeting between Donald Trump and Zohran Mamdani was not just symbolic, it showed a genuine softening of tone from both sides. As just months ago, the two had dished out sharp insults when Trump reportedly labeled Mamdani a 'communist lunatic' while Mamdani in return reportedly called Trump a 'fascist'\n\nBut on that November day in the Oval Office, things shifted it seems. According to reports, they discussed major issues affecting New Yorkers like housing affordability, grocery costs, utilities, and public safety. Trump was unexpectedly complimentary, calling Mamdani's campaign 'incredible' and saying he'd feel 'very comfortable' living in a New York City run by him. Mamdani seemingly agreed, calling the meeting productive and focused not on their ideological fights but on common ground for New Yorkers.\n\nStill, Zohran Mamdani didn't back down from his previous criticism. During another interview as per reports, he reaffirmed his belief that Donald Trump is a 'fascist' and a 'despot', insisting that his old views remain unchanged, even as he expresses willingness to cooperate. Trump, for his part, didn't flinch when Mamdani repeated those labels, he told him it was 'okay,' joking that it was easier than explaining everything during the White House press brief.\n\nAnd then this mix of tension and cooperation led to something curious and, for many online, hilarious with Trump seemingly borrowing Mamdani's aesthetic.\n\nSo, is Donald Trump actually copying Zohran Mamdani? The truth likely lies somewhere in between. On one hand, the timing of Trump's style change with the burgundy scarf, black overcoat which came right on the heels of a warm meeting, made for a great meme. Social media users were quick to laugh, joke, and speculate that Trump's stylist was taking notes. Some pointed out that the viral comparisons might even involve edited or mismatched photos of Mamdani, meaning the resemblance could be exaggerated.\n\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK",

I'm coming in there to deliver for New Yorkers.\n\nWelker wanted to elicit Mamdani's sincere answer that Trump is an existential threat to democracy.

Trump created the social media clip of the weekend by patting Mamdani on the arm and encouraging him to call the president a fascist. \n\nZohran Mamdani ⬅➡\n\nHeld his own with the commander in chief in the Oval Office. But didn’t win the charm contest. And was pilloried by some socialists for getting along with the “dictator.” \n\nJack Posobiec ⬆ \n\nThe conservative influencer was in the White House press corps and asked Mamdani the toughest questions of the day: does he intend to tax white neighborhoods more than non-white ones? Mamdani fudged the answer and Posobiec got a second moment of glory when Fox News put him on air to discuss it. \n\nWorld Socialist Web Site ⬇ \n\nThey were already furious with Mamdani for keeping NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch in place. The convivial meeting with Trump was just too much to handle.\n\nHouse GOP ⬇\n\nEighty-six Democrats, many in swing districts, joined the GOP in voting for a resolution condemning socialism before the Mamdani-Trump meeting. The GOP had a chance to tie Mamdani to every Democrat in the midterms. Now they’ve let 86 of them off the hook.\n\nNew York City ⬆ \n\nThe two most famous and polarizing New Yorkers alive met and appeared to get along.

The arrows don’t predict the future or claim special insight. They capture the prevailing winds of the moment, uncluttered by tribal howling. In an era when partisan media reinforces rather than questions assumptions, CW operates from the center—skeptical of left and right alike, committed to puncturing inflated reputations and recognizing overlooked truths.",

        "text": "For the past three years—following an amendment to the state constitution and authorization by the State Legislature—nearly a dozen developers and gambling companies have been jockeying to win three new licenses to open casinos in and around New York City. In the early days, several firms worked up preliminary proposals: a casino atop Saks Fifth Avenue’s midtown flagship store, a casino in Coney Island, a casino in Hudson Yards. New York would become the new Las Vegas; the winner would receive, as one insider put it, “a license to print money, literally.” To gin up good will, developers promised the moon and the stars: new public bathrooms and new public parks, more bike lanes, a concert hall, a museum, surveillance drones, thousands of union jobs, affordable housing, even a meeting with Beyoncé.\nNevertheless, locals opposed many of the proposals before they could even be submitted to the state. The casino company founded by Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas magnate portrayed in “Ocean’s Eleven,” pledged nearly two hundred million dollars for community programs. But not even two hundred million dollars was enough. This past May, on the same sunny morning that Jay-Z met with lawmakers in Albany to discuss his own casino plan—to convert the building above the Broadway theatre where the “Lion King” plays into a six-billion-dollar gambling complex—Wynn Resorts withdrew its proposal, admitting that it could not muster enough public support.\nThat month, at a high-school gymnasium in Hell’s Kitchen, Mayor Eric Adams held a community-affairs meeting with some constituents and local officials. Under consideration: homelessness, violent crime, scaffolding (“I hate scaffolding,” the Mayor said), domestic violence, e-bikes, lead pipes, and rumors about the forced relocation of some senior citizens living in affordable housing. Just before the meeting concluded, a woman stood up, took a microphone, and looked directly at the Mayor. “I’m concerned about all the discussions of casinos coming to New York City—and particularly in this neighborhood,” she said. For many residents, the plan spelled disaster: the lights, the noise, the crime, the traffic, the drugs, the drunk and degenerate and desperate gamblers wandering the streets at every hour of the day and night. “Is there something we can do to stop that?” the woman went on.\n“It’s not a done deal,” the Mayor said, then rambled for a little while. “It’s imperative that everyone comes out and sit down, and be part of the process to voice your concerns.”\nEvery project had a committee, and every committee had among its members representatives from the offices of several local politicians, Governor Kathy Hochul, and the Mayor. Some local politicians were supportive; others much less so. The Governor and the Mayor, for their part, supported every proposal in New York City, often over the objections of City Council members. In mid-July, the City Council struck down a plan to build a casino in the Bronx—at the site of a golf course that had until recently been operated by the Trump Organization—before it could even get to the community-advisory committee. (The Council refused to approve a necessary zoning change.) The Mayor vetoed the Council’s decision. “This is not an endorsement or expression of support giving a leg up to any casino bid over the others,” he insisted. “May the best applications win.”\nOn a humid day in September, hundreds of people gathered at a Broadway theatre for the second and final so-called public-input hearing for the project spearheaded by Jay-Z. Roc Nation, his sprawling entertainment company, had proposed, in partnership with Caesars Entertainment and SL Green Realty Corp., a casino that would bring to the neighborhood a hotel with nine ultra-luxury sky villas, a two-story night club, three thousand one hundred and forty-six slot machines, and a V.V.I.P. lounge, “the crown jewel of the vertical stack.”\nThe meeting, which was held by the community-advisory committee, lasted six hours. An unlikely alliance of supporters—a co-founder of the Blue Man Group, the former N.Y.P.D. commissioner Bill Bratton, Reverend Al Sharpton—spoke in support of the project. Bratton said, “It is not crime and mayhem that will be coming. It will be more jobs, more profit, and more safety for everybody.” Sharpton said, “Police Commissioner Bratton and I have not agreed throughout our career. I don’t even think we agree today is Thursday. But we both agree: it’s not gonna bring crime.” Other attendees spoke about the new union jobs, the economic benefit, and, as one bespectacled woman put it, “thoughtfulness from an environmental standpoint.” Still, many more were opposed.\nAn elderly woman wearing a “NO TIMES SQUARE CASINO” T-shirt said, “Yes, it might be good for some people, but it’s not gonna be good for any of the residents who are here.”\nA big, bald man said, “Casinos are exploitative.”\nA gray-haired guy reading from a clipboard said, “The two worst places I’ve ever been are Atlantic City and Las Vegas. Both are ugly and depressing, and I grew up in Florida, so that’s saying something.”\nAt one point, someone grabbed a microphone and shouted, “We are not going to shout down and boo people speaking!” At another, Sharpton said, “If somebody want to boo, I’ve been booed by the best, so take your best shot.” Sixteen public-input hearings—two for each casino proposal—were held across town. They often got heated and contentious. At the Y.M.C.A. gymnasium in Coney Island, police officers had to break up at least two fights between the project’s supporters and opponents; several locals alleged that developers had paid people eighty dollars apiece to speak favorably about the casino, and one of them said there were secret audio recordings to prove it. (The New York Gaming Commission did not investigate these allegations, claiming that it was not in their purview.) When, at a hearing in Queens, the executive director of a group called the Chinese American Parents Association spoke in favor of the proposal to build a Hard Rock casino near Citi Field, someone else shouted, “Sellout!”\n“Who said ‘sellout’?” Larinda Hooks, a State Assembly member, said. She was in charge of the hearing, and had sponsored a bill in the State Legislature that allowed the casino to be constructed atop the baseball field’s fifty acres of parking lots, which are technically city parkland. (Steve Cohen, the hedge-fund mogul who owns the Mets, spent, along with his development partners, more than two and a half million dollars lobbying state lawmakers last year.) Immediately, a young woman hoisted a handmade “FOLLOW THE $!” sign even higher into the air.\nHooks shouted, “Security, please! The young lady in the red sweater, please, has to be removed.”\nAfter the public hearings this summer, the committees began to make their decisions. Jay-Z’s casino bid for Times Square was the first to fail. Afterward, in a meeting room filled with reporters, Marc Holliday, the C.E.O. of SL Green, the real-estate company associated with the bid (and one of the largest landlords in New York City), approached the committee members and began shouting, “Go run and hide! The benefits you denied this community, and this city, and state—you have to live with that history forever.” Minutes later, in the same room, another committee rejected Silverstein’s proposal, and, in the following days, yet another committee killed a proposal to build Freedom Plaza—an eleven-billion-dollar casino complex backed by the head of a private intelligence firm—on Manhattan’s East Side, near the United Nations. Within a week, all the Manhattan casinos were dead.\nMeanwhile, in Queens, another committee gathered in another committee room, to vote on a proposal by Resorts World, which already operates the racino near J.F.K. “Sorry, Jay-Z. We win again,” Donovan Richards, Jr., who is the Queens borough president, said, as he cast his vote in favor of the proposal. “I just had to rub that in.” The vote was unanimous; the audience burst into applause. Afterward, Richards embraced several executives.\nI walked out of the meeting with one of them: Robert DeSalvio, who oversees Resorts World. He was headed toward the racino, where a celebration would be held later that evening. “I think we proved that we’re a good neighbor,” he told me. “And you know how hard that is.” I decided to stop by Resorts World, too. As I approached in an Uber, my driver, who lives nearby, said, “I feel so much negativity towards this place. Everyone’s gambling!”\nInside, I watched for a while as a woman wearing Crocs stuffed hundred-dollar bills into a “TRIPLE SUPREME EXTREME” slot machine with a sign that announced a “$12,246.18 JACKPOT.” Then I sat down at a “WHEEL OF FORTUNE” machine to try my own luck. Right away, I won twenty dollars—and then lost it all. The afternoon passed quickly: I lost more, I won big, I again lost everything but five cents. Refusing defeat, I stuffed more money into a slot machine. Eventually, against all odds, the machine began whizzing and whirring and making noises that my body immediately associated with success: I had won fifty dollars! Somehow, I mustered the sense to cash out.\nIf Resorts World wins one of the new gaming licenses, the racino will be allowed to add two thousand five hundred more slot machines, seven hundred live table games, thirty restaurants, a thousand six hundred hotel rooms, and a seven-thousand-seat arena to the existing complex. (Under the current licensure, live dealers are forbidden; the gambling games at Resorts World are technically “video lottery terminals,” not slot machines.) “We think we have a terrific application,” DeSalvio had told me. “We have all the permits—all the environmental permits, the building permits. We can be up and running by next March.” He grinned and went on, “We’ll have to train a lot of local folks how to be dealers.”\nThree other casino bids made it through their community-advisory committees: a project proposed by M-G-M to expand another existing racino, in Yonkers; the Bally’s proposal, at the old Trump golf course; and Steve Cohen’s Hard Rock casino, in the Citi Field parking lot. In late September, at the committee meeting that approved the Citi Field project—Metropolitan Park, as it’s known—Steve McCann, a union leader from Queens, told me, “It’s supposed to create thousands of construction jobs. I’m not opposed to rich corporations that want to spend money, if they want to use union labor.”\nAfter the vote, P. J. O’Doherty, another union leader from Queens, who has spent the past thirty-five years pouring concrete, told me, “Listen, people complain about gambling and the casinos and all that, but see what I have right here?” He pulled out his iPhone. “You can go on your phone and gamble like crazy, if you want. You can lose everything, and you don’t even have to leave the house.”\nI asked him if he’d visit the new casino. “I worked too hard for my money,” he said, with a laugh. “But I’ll go there—it’s more than gambling!” Most supporters of the casinos with whom I spoke seemed more interested in talking about the new construction jobs, the new high-end restaurants, the new hotel rooms and concert venues, and the millions of dollars in community investment than about the actual gambling that would occur there. DeSalvio, of Resorts World, told me, “I work in the business, so I don’t gamble.” Soo Kim, the Bally’s chairman, told me, “I don’t gamble.” Vicki Been, the chairwoman of New York’s Gaming Facility Location Board, which will decide which applicants advance to the final review by the state, told a reporter this summer that she had never been to a casino. “That’s nowhere I want to spend my time,” she said.\nLast year, Richards, the Queens borough president, said, “People absolutely will be hurt with a casino being in close proximity. But our jobs are to make sure that we are minimizing it as much as possible.” (More recently, he told me, “The target audience is the tourists!”) The negative and positive effects of casinos on communities have been well documented in academic literature. New casinos are often followed by a boost in economic activity, increased property values, and additional tax revenue for state and local governments. (Over the next decade, New York stands to make some twenty billion dollars in revenue from the three new casino licenses, with much of the money earmarked for schools and public transportation.) New pawnshops and payday lenders in the surrounding area also follow the construction of a new casino—as does a population’s increased vulnerability to problem gambling, which can in turn lead to substance abuse, psychiatric issues, obesity, arthritis. When I told Kim, who bought Donald Trump’s golf-course lease in the Bronx for sixty million dollars specifically to pursue the casino project, that I was generally wary of casinos because of the harm they might cause, he told me, “We are philosophically the same, because you cannot kill your customers. It’s bad for business.”\nKim purchased the lease—the city of New York owns the land on which the casino would be built—from Trump with a provision in the contract that, if the casino moves forward, Trump would receive another hundred and fifteen million dollars. “That’s a small price to pay,” Kim said. “The community got a better deal than Trump. Think about all the jobs, the money—it’s billions of economic activity.” He went on, “We out-dealed him.”\nNear the fourteenth hole of the course, Kim parked a golf cart and looked around. The Manhattan skyline shimmered in the distance. “I grew up right there, at the base of that bridge,” Kim said, pointing to the far side of the Throgs Neck Bridge, in Queens. “And this”—he looked around, watching for a moment as a man in coveralls trimmed the creeping bent grass on the putting green—“this was, like, where you rode your dirt bikes and dumped dead bodies and set off fireworks.” Kim settled on the Trump course in part because of its proximity to the freeway. “Look, I love the subway. I grew up on the subway. But people don’t ride the subway to the casino,” he explained.\nZohran Mamdani, the incoming mayor, who has said that he is personally opposed to casinos (“Gambling is haram,” he once quipped), clarified on the campaign trail that he wouldn’t do anything to stop them. Brian O’Dwyer, the chair of the New York Gaming Commission, which will award the licenses by the end of the year, said, “The question is, Who does best for the community—and the state of New York in terms of tax revenues?” Each casino promises to generate billions of dollars in taxable revenue a year: Bally’s, one and a half billion; Resorts World, roughly four billion; the Hard Rock complex near Citi Field, nearly four billion. But other criteria—the casinos’ effects on neighborhood traffic, diversity-equity-and-inclusion initiatives for new jobs, efforts to assist gambling addicts—will also be assessed.\nIn mid-October, M-G-M withdrew its bid for the casino complex in Yonkers, citing uncertainty that it could earn as much money as had initially been proposed. Mike Spano, the mayor of Yonkers, was outraged. “Something doesn’t add up here,” he said, demanding that Governor Hochul launch an investigation. “People need to be assured that there is no linkage between M-G-M’s decision and the massive financial benefit to Donald Trump.” (With M-G-M out of the running, there were three bids for three licenses, increasing the odds that the Trump Organization would get its payout.) Hochul later weighed in: “I, at this time, am not aware of any reason to launch an investigation. I have no evidence to suspect there is any wrongdoing.” When I spoke with Spano this month, he told me that he was now less concerned with potential wrongdoing than with the fallout from Bally’s or Citi Field opening up nearby, which, he said, would likely lead M-G-M to close their Yonkers racino. “We’d lose our largest private tax-payer,” he said, growing emotional. “It’s a loss of, immediately, a thousand jobs.”\nIn late November, members of the gaming board toured the remaining proposed sites in golf carts. As the bidders waited for the verdict, some community members made a last-ditch effort to stop the projects from moving forward. One evening, a protester dressed in a black puffer and a gray beanie, who opposed the Citi Field casino, disrupted an official meeting. “This casino is going to destroy our community,” the protester said, calmly. “You all look like wonderful people. We know that you can do the right thing.” (Afterward, the meeting was closed to the public.) Casino executives and local politicians began to point out that not all three licenses had to be granted—and that maybe their failed bids had a shot, after all. “The whole process and the outcome is still unknown,” Holliday, of the Times Square bid, said, on a recent earnings call. Spano, the mayor of Yonkers, told me, “If they only issue two licenses, maybe we’ll get another bite at the apple!”\nAs Kim pitched me on the project at the golf course—“cashless wagering” at the five-hundred-thousand-square-foot casino, a “polished casual Latino-Caribbean restaurant,” a rooftop bar offering an “elevated social experience infused with a touch of Bronx flair and unmistakable pizzazz”—I thought less about Trump and more about Resorts World, where, at that very moment, hundreds of people were feeding the existing slots. Kim said, “Look, the core customer is a retired woman, and a lot of them have Social Security checks—they’re not using them! That three hundred and eighty dollars doesn’t really change their lives. You know what it is? It’s a relatively cheap thrill. People don’t go to the casino to make money. Obviously, the odds are against you. You go because you like the risk of it—”\nHe paused, mid-thought. His phone rang. He took a quick call, collected himself, and continued, “Sorry, so, yeah, people want to take risk. That’s actually what it is. Most animals want to reduce risk. Human beings don’t have that. They have a gene that wants to take risk—that’s why we jump out of perfectly good airplanes. It’s the thrill of the unknown. And that’s what makes humans so unique. Gambling scratches that itch, but it does so in a very controlled way. It’s just a little bit of money. It’s actually not risk.” He moved his hands slowly as he spoke: “You could lose every dollar of your life, and yet you’d still have your health, and the sun comes up in the morning, and we can all equally enjoy this sunny, beautiful day. I don’t want to be metaphysical, but I’m just saying money isn’t the be-all, end-all.” ♦",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani didn’t back down in an interview that aired Sunday from past criticism that President Donald Trump acted like a despot and a fascist after a surprisingly friendly White House meeting between the two men.\n\nThe newly elected democratic socialist and the Republican president have fiercely criticized each other in the past. Trump called Mamdani a “100% Communist Lunatic” in a social media post following the incoming mayor’s election victory, and Mamdani has said Trump was attacking democracy. Yet the two political foils emerged smiling after the meeting Friday and spoke of shared goals.\n\nPressed about his past criticism during a “Meet the Press” interview conducted Saturday, Mamdani said his views remained unchanged.\n\n“Everything that I’ve said in the past, I continue to believe,” Mamdani said. “And that’s the thing that I think is important in our politics, is that we don’t shy away from where we have disagreements, but we understand what it is that brings us to that table, because I’m not coming into the Oval Office to make a point or make a stand. I’m coming in there to deliver for New Yorkers.”\n\nTrump had brushed aside Mamdani’s criticisms Friday and even jumped in on his defense several times. When a reporter asked if Mamdani stood by his comments that Trump is a fascist, Trump interjected before Mamdani could fully answer the question.\n\n“That’s OK. You can just say yes. OK?” Trump said. “It’s easier. It’s easier than explaining it. I don’t mind.”\n\nAsked about the fascist criticism on “Meet the Press,” Mamdani said, “That’s something that I’ve said in the past. I say it today. ”\n\nKevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” talk show that Trump wants to work with everybody who cares about the future of the American people.\n\n“We’re at times disagreeing about policies,” Hassett said, “but I think that the objective of making life better for everybody is something that a lot of people share on the Democratic and Republican side.”\n\nThough far apart politically, the White House meeting offered potential political benefits for both men. The incoming mayor was able to meet one-on-one with the president, and Trump got to to talk about affordability, an issue that is increasingly important to voters.",

        "text": "By the end of Biden’s term, a record high 52 million immigrants were in the United States, comprising another record high 16% of the total population. And many of these immigrants are perfectly law-abiding people with a valid legal presence. But millions are not.\n\nThis week, the City Journal uncovered widespread fraud in Minnesota’s Somali community, which took advantage of the state’s Medicaid Housing Stabilization Services program to enrich not only themselves, but also fund terrorists back in Africa. Created by Gov. Tim Walz, the HSS Program used federal and state taxpayer dollars to provide “housing services,” such as “housing consultation” and “moving expenses,” to people with disabilities, mental illness, and substance use disorders. \n\nThe fraudsters would sign people up for the program, bill the state, and then never provide the services. What was supposed to be an annual $2.6 million ended up costing taxpayers $104 million a year, with sizable portions of the money being sent back to the Al-Shabaab terrorist group in Africa. One confidential source told City Journal, “The largest funder of Al-Shabaab is the Minnesota taxpayer.”\n\nThis all comes after federal and Minnesota taxpayers were fleeced by the Feeding Our Future program in 2020, where members of the Somali community pocketed hundreds of millions in tax dollars for school lunches that were never provided. \n\nIn Charlotte, Democrats criticized Trump’s Charlotte’s Web immigration enforcement surge, noting that 30,000 students in Charlotte public schools, over 20% of the student body, failed to show up for class during the raid. That truly is an outrageous number, but not in the way Democrats think. If 20% of Charlotte public school students come from illegal immigrant households, that means thousands of native-born students are being weighted down with non-English speakers in their classrooms. If anything, the numbers show just how out of control the illegal immigrant population has gotten in some communities, only underscoring the need for deportations.\n\nAnd in New York City, the proud socialist Zohran Mamdani won his election to be mayor in no small part due to his promise to strengthen and expand rent controls. While Mamdani’s rent protections would apply to natives and immigrants alike, it is highly relevant that 40% of all rent-stabilized housing in New York City is occupied by foreign-born residents. Seems New York City’s housing affordability crisis could largely be solved by some much-needed immigration law enforcement.\n\nEnforcing immigration law is a difficult and thankless task. No one likes deporting migrants who have done nothing wrong but enter the country illegally (or illegally stayed past their temporary visa). But if we don’t enforce immigration law and just let everyone stay, then we really do not have a sovereign country. Few people recognize this better than legal immigrants.\n\nAccording to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation/New York Times poll, while 49% of legal immigrant voters said Trump’s deportations made them angry, 46% also said the deportations were “necessary,” including 80% of Republican immigrants and 52% of independent immigrants. Asked in the same poll if the current immigration law was “too tough,” “not tough enough,” or “about right,” 61% of legal immigrant voters chose “about right.”\n\nTrump’s mass deportations may be difficult, but the alternative is a country that tolerates rampant fraud, classrooms overwhelmed by non-English speakers, soaring housing costs, and a foreign-born population growing faster than the nation can absorb. Increasingly, even legal immigrants understand that real sovereignty demands enforcement, not empathy. Restoring order to the immigration system isn’t cruelty; it’s the necessary first step toward restoring strength and stability.",

        "text": "Coffee’s for closers! \n\nAlec Baldwin — the actor who uttered perhaps the most iconic movie line ever about java, and also once publicly railed against a Starbucks worker as an “Uptight Queen barrista [sic]” with an “attitude problem” — is now a contributing producer on a film backing the coffee chain’s workers.\n\nBaldwin appeared last week at a fundraiser and screening for “Baristas vs Billionaires” at Lincoln Center’s Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center. \n\nThe movie by Mark Mori about Starbucks Workers United says it follows a “generational uprising of working-class Millennials and Gen Z as they battle Starbucks Coffee for their right to unionize.”\n\nThe Starbucks union’s current strike has expanded to over 30 locations nationwide, The Post reported, and the latest work stoppage hit a store in Albany, NY, after NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani called for a boycott of the chain.\n\nMori told us that Baldwin got involved by doing voiceovers for sample reels of the doc, and giving feedback on early cuts of the film.\n\nIronically back in September 2011, Baldwin had an apparent run-in with a barista at the coffee chain in Manhattan, leading to some snippy tweets at the time!\n\n“Starbucks on 93 and B’way. Uptight Queen barrista [sic] named JAY has an attitude problem,” the volatile star posted over a decade ago, The Post reported at the time.\n\nBaldwin, 67, followed up the 2011 Twitter tirade by complementing an employee at another NYC establishment.\n\n“Clyde, on the other hand, outside DINOSAUR BARBECUE @ W 125 n H River is MY MAN,” he tweeted. “Keeping the hickory ovens going, he is 2dayz Coolest NYer.” (No documentary on Dinosaur just yet!) \n\nAt the time, another barista told The Post of Baldwin’s Starbucks incident: “I was here when it happened — it was really just [Baldwin] being an [expletive]… He was very rude and disrespectful and arrogant. He’s probably the rudest guy I’ve ever met.”\n\nIt also turned out that Baldwin seemingly got the allegedly offending Starbucks employee’s name, “Jay,” wrong at the time — as there was no one with that handle at the shop. (A colleague said back then that there was a staffer named “Giovan” who probably was the target of Alec’s ire.)\n\n“And he didn’t do anything wrong; it was all that dude just being psycho,” the second brew-slinger reportedly said in 2011. “I saw a thing on [cable channel E!] a little while ago, and it was talking about how crazy he was. They were right.”\n\nBaldwin’s spokesman said at the time in response, “Starbucks is a great company… Unfortunately, not all of their employees can live up to their high standards.”\n\nThe Post also reported that Baldwin had contacted the company’s corporate offices and spoke to a regional manager.\n\nA rep for Baldwin did not return a request for comment about the new film, or the past incident.\n\nEither way, the “30 Rock” star is now standing with the Frappuccino servers!\n\nMori told us: “I’ve known Alec for about 35 years, and we collaborated on two TV projects (“Raw Footage” and “51 Classic Documentaries”) over the years. When we were in the initial stages for ‘Baristas vs Billionaires’ in early 2023, I mentioned the project to Alec and he immediately got involved.”\n\nMori — a 1991 Oscar nominee and 2001 Emmy winner — added of Baldwin, “He also attended our world premiere at Buffalo International Film Festival in October, and he participated in multiple audience Q&As, often citing his father’s work in a teachers union. Alec supports the baristas and their work highlighted in the film.” \n\nThe movie’s playing Buffalo and Santa Fe, NM, before moving to Madison, Wis., and other markets. \n\nBaldwin, of course, made the famed “coffee’s for closers” speech in David Mamet’s classic, “Glengarry Glen Ross” — in a scene that the playwright added for the big screen adaptation.",

You could’ve come here.'” Mayor Mike Spano told The Post. “So I’m going to be upfront and open, and basically send the message to New York that I like billionaires.\n\n“I like billionaires, I like the average Joe, and I’d like you to come to and try Yonkers. If you’re going to leave, come here,” he added.\n\nSpano, a former state lawmaker and ex-Republican, calls himself a “radical moderate” Democrat and said that “when New York City sneezes, we get the cold.” He’s now making his pitch in a splashy “Think Yonkers” video ad.\n\n“Here in Yonkers, we built a city that delivers for businesses, for developments and for the people that matter most,” Spano says in the clip. “So if you’re looking to take your business someplace else, think Yonkers.”\n\nSpano didn’t direct any specific ire towards Mamdani and said he looks forward to meeting with him and working with the administration at some point, but claimed he just wants to get in front of people’s anxieties about New York’s business climate.\n\nMamdani has said he wants the state to OK a tax increase on the wealthy and hike the corporate tax to generate funds for his democratic socialist agenda, which critics fear could drive away businesses for greener — and cheaper pastures.\n\nYonkers’ may provide an option just out of reach of the city subway — with its downtown growing in recent years. Spano touts a focus on housing development while boasting diverse local employers like rail car manufacturer Kawasaki as well as Lionsgate film and television studio.\n\nHe said the Westchester County city — the third-largest in the state — offers “microcosm of New York City” with other built-in perks such as avoiding Big Apple local corporate taxes and other fees on businesses all while remaining 15 miles from midtown Manhattan.\n\n“We saw the future potential even before the situation that just happened,” Hershey Friedman, chair of the board of Azorim, a major real estate developer that’s been building in the city, told The Post.\n\n“The taxes are low. They’ve got everything that a person is looking for. Yonkers is the place, as far as we’re concerned,” he added.\n\nYonkers denizens say they’ve heard the cries of New York’s collapse before.\n\n“It won’t be much different than the mass exodus that happened during COVID,” Amanda Breen, one of the owners of Irish Coffee Shop on McLean Avenue said.\n\n“People bought houses wherever they would find along here and anywhere in Westchester,” she said.\n\nRory Dolan, owner of his namesake Irish Pub & Restaurant in the Yonkers for 32 years as well as other restaurants in New York, told The Post said he’s seen people flee the city before.\n\n“People left town after 9/11 and then maybe after a year go back again. After Covid too,” he said.\n\nBut he thinks the tales of the city’s deaths are greatly exaggerated.\n\n“I came here in 1986. I’ve been around for Koch, Dinkins, Giuliani, Bloomberg, de Blasio, and Adams. It didn’t happen then,” he said.",

I will say there’s no difference in party. There’s no difference in anything, and we’re going to be helping him to make everybody’s dream come true, having a strong and very safe New York.”\n\nThe president congratulated Mamdani on his mayoral victory, describing it as “an incredible race against smart people” – and the two politicians shook hands.\n\nTrump added that he had already seen signs the young politician might surprise both conservative and liberal observers alike.\n\nFor Mamdani, the meeting represented vindication of his strategy to focus the discussion on economic issues rather than ideological divides. He described the meeting as “productive” and “focused on a place of shared admiration and love, which is New York City”.\n\n“We spoke about rent, we spoke about groceries, we spoke about utilities, we spoke about the different ways in which people are being pushed out,” Mamdani told reporters after emerging from the Oval Office.\n\nTrump added: “We had some interesting conversation, and some of his ideas really are the same ideas that I have.” He pointed to their agreement on lowering crime and building housing.\n\nThe meeting marked the first face-to-face discussion between the combative Republican president and the defiant democratic socialist.\n\nFor Mamdani, a leftwing state assemblymember until his shock primary victory, the sit-down presented an early test of his ability to negotiate with a president who controls vast federal resources that the city depends upon. Mamdani’s team made the first move in reaching out for a meeting, all while Trump earlier threatened to withhold federal funding from New York if Mamdani took office, though he has since suggested a more conciliatory posture, telling Fox News: “I’m so torn, because I would like to see the new mayor do well, because I love New York.”\n\nThe administration has deployed multiple pressure tactics ahead of the meeting. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have signaled plans to escalate operations in New York City, while a number of rightwing congressional Republicans suggested investigating whether Mamdani’s citizenship is valid, despite his naturalization in 2018 after immigrating from Uganda as a child.\n\nMamdani’s team spent Thursday preparing for the encounter through calls with Kathy Hochul, New York’s governor, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, and the civil rights leader Al Sharpton to strategize the approach. He also spoke with Robert Wolf, the former chief executive of UBS Americas and a known ally of Barack Obama.\n\nWhen asked on Thursday whether he feared receiving hostile treatment similar to the contentious Oval Office meeting between Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, earlier this year – where Trump accused Zelenskyy of “gambling with world war III” – Mamdani brushed aside concerns. “I’ll stand up for New Yorkers every single day,” he replied.\n\nThe incoming mayor had framed the meeting as an opportunity to advance his central campaign platform: making New York more affordable. His promises include free public buses, government-run grocery stores, rent freezes for more than 1m stabilized units, and the city’s first universal childcare program.\n\n“I view this meeting as an opportunity for me to make my case,” Mamdani said on Thursday. “It behooves me to ensure that I leave no stone unturned in looking to make this city more affordable.”\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, similarly said Trump’s willingness to meet was evidence of his openness to dialogue across political divides.\n\n“President Trump is willing to meet with anyone and talk to anyone and to try to do what’s right on behalf of the American people, whether they live in blue states or red states, or blue cities,” Leavitt said.\n\nBut the underlying tensions were not subtle. Trump got directly involved in the mayoral election, dismissing the candidate from his own party, Curtis Sliwa, as a lightweight and instead endorsing Andrew Cuomo, the Independent, formerly Democratic governor, while branding Mamdani a “little communist”. The Trump administration also yanked federal aid for critical infrastructure projects – including the Gateway Tunnel between New York and New Jersey and the Second Avenue subway line – during budget negotiations.\n\nAmong New York voters, Trump garnered only 27% approval compared with 70% disapproval in CNN’s exit polling from the mayoral election. However, 10% of Trump’s 2024 voters also cast ballots for Mamdani, suggesting there is indeed overlap in their populist economic messaging, despite their vast ideological differences.",

        "text": "Sure, we know Mamdani is charming, but so is Barack Obama, another leader Trump has spent friendly-seeming time with, even as he falsely accuses Obama of treason. So it's got to be more than Mamdani's charisma. Here, we offer up five theories to explain what Vanity Fair's Aidan McLaughlin described as a “lovefest.”\nTrump is powerless in the presence of a beard\nName the powerful bearded politician who made these comments about Donald Trump:\n\n“Trump is a cynical asshole … he’s America’s Hitler.”\n“I don’t think he actually cares about folks.”\n”He’s noxious and is leading the white working class to a very dark place.\"\n\nTed Cruz? No, I said “powerful.” It's Vice-Presdent J.D. Vance! Before Friday, the only things Vance and Mamdani had in common were a track record of Trump opposition and a beard. After Friday, they could add Trump's glowing praise to the list of commonalities. Fox News host Brian Kilmeade might be on a similar track as I am, saying “I think J.D. Vance is jealous\" as he discussed Friday's event.\nTrump watched Heat Thursday night\nEveryone agrees that the coffee shop meeting between Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's characters is the most indelible scene in Michael Mann's classic 1995 film Heat. Nemeses in the same room, the grudging respect between hero and villain, the growing understanding that the opposites are far more alike than they realized…it's one of the world's most compelling narratives, from Batman and the Joker to the horseshoe theory.\nMamdani looked in Trump's left eye\nAccording to the New York Post, which appears to be where most of Middle America gets their Zohran Mamdani news, MIT prof Tara Swart says that mothers and their babies bond using right eye to left eye contact. “Most people are right-handed so they’ll be holding their baby in their left arm, so they can use their dominant hand to do stuff,\" she says. “That means when you gaze at your baby, your right eye is looking at their left and then that interaction from the optic nerve is going around the brain.” According to Swart, that eye contact creates an “emotional resonance loop that’s part of how the mother and baby bond.” So, if we assume that Trump was able to keep his eyes open during the private meeting he had with Mamdani prior to the press event, Mamdani might have been able to provide the president with enough maternal good vibes to briefly counteract Trump's awful-sounding upbringing by Fred Trump.\nSome Mamdani-loving billionaire got on the horn\nLong branded a horrific hellhole by Fox News, San Francisco has been bracing for Trump to deploy the National Guard to the famously liberal town since he started rolling troops into Democrat-led cities earlier this year. In October, the incursion seemed inevitable—that is, until a couple oligarchs, including billionaire Salesforce founder Marc Benioff and billionaire Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, called Trump and told him to stand down. Trump complied.\n“One of the things that President Trump is really good at is he’s a really good listener,” Huang told the SF Chronicle about the call. “If you appeal to him, logically, pragmatically, with common sense, he will listen.” Benioff's Mamdami-aligned creds have recently taken a beating, but it wasn’t that long ago that he backed a hefty tax on large corporations to generate funds to fight homelessness. And Benioff was a White House guest on Tuesday, at the president's dinner to fete Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. An ideal time, perhaps, to take the president aside and suggest a warm and friendly approach.\nDonald Trump has been engaging in the greatest long con of all time\nRemember when Donald Trump was on Sex and the City? When he donated to Kamala Harris's campaign when she ran for California Attorney General? When he told CNN “I probably identify more as a Democrat…And it just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats than the Republicans”? Some pundits describe his remarkable change in position as a set of craven flip-flops, a symptom of someone who lacks a belief in anything but power, or a sign of “accelerating cognitive decline.”\nBut Occam's Razor is overrated! What if, as Mamdani's election rival Curtis Sliwa claimed last night, “we all got played”? Is Trump about to reveal himself as a deep cover mole for The Resistance? It's 2025, don't rule it out.",

        "text": "It's been a rainbow of emotions from President Donald Trump's White House during the pre-Thanksgiving week.\n\nTrump has praised democratic socialist New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, poked fun at one-time ally Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and prodded Republicans in Congress to reverse course on the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\nAnd Trump, known for his black and blue suits paired with bright-colored ties, is again embracing color. He emerged from the White House on Nov. 22, wrapped in a shawl-like burgundy scarf and long black wool coat.\n\nLeft-leaning journalist Aaron Rupar wrote \"quite a look for Trump today\" on X, formerly Twitter, seemingly taking notice of Trump's changing outfit choice. Trump was traveling to join golf icon Jack Nicklaus at Andrews Air Force Base about 40 minutes outside of Washington, D.C.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene resigns from Congress to live full life\n\nHe told a pool of reporters that Nicklaus – owner of Nicklaus Design, an internationally regarded golf course design and construction company – plans to rebuild two golf courses and additional recreational facilities located on the base. An owner of 12 golf courses inside the U.S., Trump said the government-operated courses were \"in very bad shape.\"\n\nHe also took time to swing again at departing Georgia congresswoman Greene, the day after her Nov. 21 nighttime resignation announcement. \"I just disagreed with her philosophy,\" Trump told the press.\n\n\"She started backing perhaps the worst Republican congressman in our history, you know the stupid person named Massie,\" Trump added on the South Lawn. \"I said go your own way and once I left her, she resigned because she never would've survived a primary, but I think she's a nice person.\"\n\nMore: GOP lawmaker hits back after Donald Trump appears to knock his marriage\n\nGreene will exit the House of Representatives on Jan. 5 next year. \"I'm going back to the people I love, to live life to the fullest as I always have,\" she said on social media. Earlier that day, Trump faced widespread online discourse following his embrace of New York mayor-elect Mamdani during an Oval Office meeting Nov. 21.\n\nTrump charts a new course with Mamdani?\n\nTrump once called for Mamdani to be arrested if he didn't help with the administration's sweeping immigration crackdown and argued against giving federal money to New York over Mamdani's far-left politics. For his part, Mamdani previously called Trump a fascist and said he's ready to take on the president over his immigration policies in an election night victory speech earlier this month.\n\nThe pair's first meeting was originally presumed to be contentious but left Trump content. \"I expect to be helping him, not hurting him – a big help,\" Trump said, \"because I want New York City to be great.\"\n\nMore: Are the rich fleeing Mamdani’s Manhattan? Not according to the data.\n\n\"He wants to see housing go up, see a lot of housing created, apartments built... People would be shocked, but I want to see the same thing,\" the president said. A colorful change of heart on Trump's table, and underneath his coat, less than a week before American families scarf down their Thanksgiving meals.\n\nContributing: Reuters; Eduardo Cuevas, Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy, Joey Garrison, USA TODAY",

        "text": "When many Democrats on Friday voted in favor of a resolution condemning socialism, New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani was on his way to what turned out to be a surprisingly cordial meeting with President Donald Trump. Asked about the resolution, Mamdani responded: \"I have to be honest with you, I focus very little on resolutions, frankly. I think the focus is on the work at hand. I can tell you I am someone who is a democratic socialist. I've been very open about that. I know there might be differences about ideology, but the place of agreement is the work that needs to be done to make New York City affordable. That's what I look forward to.\" \n\nMamdani has indeed been open about being a democratic socialist, and has even affirmed the label in the context of denying that he is a communist. When he won the Democrat primary in late June, President Donald Trump, less friendly than he was during their Friday meeting, called Mamdani “a 100% Communist Lunatic.” Asked if he really was a communist, Mamdani responded emphatically: “No, I am not. I call myself a democratic socialist, in many ways, inspired by the words of [Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.] from decades ago, who said, ‘Call it democracy or call it democratic socialism: There has to be a better distribution of wealth for all of God’s children in this country.’” \n\nMamdani’s answer, which he has repeated on other occasions as well, actually raised more questions than it answered. The democratic socialist wunderkind invoked Martin Luther King in speaking of the alleged need for a “better distribution of wealth,” but did not explain why the best distribution of wealth isn’t the simple process of someone working, getting fairly compensated for his or her labor, and being able to dispose of that compensation as he or she sees fit. Why must there be government-mandated “distribution” of wealth at all? To talk as if such government action is necessary is to talk like a communist, the very thing Mamdani has repeatedly denied being.\n\nIn fact, the program of the Democratic Socialists of America, to which Mamdani belongs, sounds very much like communism. The Democratic Socialists of America denounce capitalism as a “system designed by the owning class to exploit the rest of us for their own profit” and proclaim: “We want a democracy that creates space for us all to flourish not just survive and answers the fundamental questions of our lives with the input of all. We want to collectively own the key economic drivers that dominate our lives, such as energy production and transportation. We want the multiracial working class united in solidarity instead of divided by fear.”\n\nPeel away the lofty rhetoric, and that’s a call for collective ownership of “the key economic drivers that dominate our lives,” which in practice has always meant government ownership of the means of production — for which Mamdani himself called in 2020. Democratic socialism, then, and communism are essentially identical. \n\nMany people assume, of course, that what distinguishes democratic socialism from communism is that democratic socialism is genuinely “democratic,” while communism aims to implement the dictatorship of the proletariat.= \n\nThis, too, however, is a distinction without a difference. Communist regimes have not infrequently called themselves democratic: think of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Many in the West have taken such names as an exercise in cynical deception, but there is more going on here than just that. In his biography of the founder of the Soviet Union, Lenin: The Man, the Dictator, and the Master of Terror, Victor Sebestyen explains that “Lenin in power had no intention of allowing a free parliament. He may on occasions in the past have written in praise of elections. But he didn’t believe in ‘bourgeois democracy’ on principle and certainly not in practice for a revolutionary state. The dictatorship of the proletariat and the authority of the Soviet were ‘not only a higher form of democracy…[but] the only form of democracy.’”\n\nRelated: Mamdani: Like Father, Like Son\n\nHow could it be otherwise? The dictatorship of the proletariat was the workers’ tool for establishing a just society in which he would finally enjoy what was his due: a “better distribution of wealth,” as Mamdani put it. Thus it was the truest and fullest expression of what democracy really was.\n\nZohran Mamdani is therefore both a democratic socialist and a communist. There is no contradiction between the two. This will become clearer as he settles in as mayor and begins to implement his agenda. Pay close attention, comrades!",

        "text": "Mamdani, an unabashed socialist who routinely positioned himself as a leader of the anti-Trump resistance, now finds himself in a tough position. His base demands ideological purity, but governing New York City means dealing with the realities of… well… governing. The meeting put Mamdani in a tough spot: embrace some pragmatism or risk alienating his left-wing supporters.\n\nThe left’s reaction to the meeting has been a mix of panic and confusion.\n\nTake Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who tried to spin the encounter on CNN’s The Lead. Warren claimed Trump was trying to latch onto Mamdani’s rising profile because he “has a problem with affordability,” and sees Mamdani as the new face of the issue. She argued, “So is it any surprise that Donald Trump wants to stand next to Zohran Mamdani and say, ‘Oh, yeah, we think about things the same way, particularly when it comes to affordability'?” She added, “He’s just trying to take a little of the shine that Zohran Mamdani has and see if he can, you know, rub a little on Donald Trump.”\n\nThat’s a hilarious theory. After four years of unchecked inflation under Trump, inflation is finally getting under control, while wages are going up. For Mamdani, affordability is a talking point. For Trump, it’s actual results.\n\nICYMI: Trump Reacts to MTG's Resignation, and It Is Brutal\n\nHere are the facts: Democrats have no idea why Trump met with Mamdani in the Oval Office and are struggling to understand the move, and seem to consider the possibility that Trump has a strategy. When I first saw the video of the meeting, it reminded me of Trump’s meeting earlier this year with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. The backlash she got from the left was brutal, and won’t do her any favors when she runs for president in 2028. And we all know that she will.\n\nMamdani now faces a similar dilemma: accept Trump’s diplomacy and risk losing his far-left credibility, or reject it and potentially miss out on pragmatic cooperation he needs to run New York City effectively, at a time when his base demands resistance to everything Trump does, which puts Mamdani in a no-win situation.\n\nThe encounter allows Trump to craft an image of a presidential, pragmatic leader extending a hand of cooperation without losing his supporters’ trust. Meanwhile, Mamdani risks appearing too conciliatory, potentially fracturing his support among the radical left, who expected diehard resistance.\n\nMake no mistake about it, contrary to what Sen. Warren said, Trump isn’t hoping some of Mamdani’s shine rubs off on him; he’s looking to rub a little bit of his own shine on Mamdani, and watch the chickens of the left start a pecking party.\n\nDemocrats can pile up excuses, yet the scene speaks for itself. Trump stepped into the moment with a presidential posture and offered an unexpected olive branch. Mamdani now walks a tightrope between ideological purity and governing in the real world. Democrats scramble for explanations. Trump’s instincts continue to set the pace, leaving his opponents completely unprepared.",

        "text": "No other week in Donald Trump’s second presidency has made it clearer that control of the media is now a central MAGA objective. To wrap a remarkable span of days at the White House, he permitted New York City Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani, who was visiting the Oval Office at Trump’s invitation, to reaffirm his assessment that the president is indeed a fascist. Hosting Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday, Trump heaped praise on the strongman tied by U.S. intelligence to the brutal 2018 murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “We’ve always been on the same side of every issue,” Trump said of bin Salman in front of the gathered journalists, one of whom quickly found herself in the president’s firing line. \n\nABC News reporter Mary Bruce asked Trump about the crown prince’s connection to Khashoggi’s murder and Trump’s reversal on releasing the Epstein files. The president reprimanded her, calling her “insubordinate” and a “terrible person,” and recommending that Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr revoke ABC’s broadcast license.\n\nBeyond the president, other MAGA figures are exerting pressure on major journalistic institutions to place ideological loyalists into key media roles while pushing out dissenting voices: A hallmark of authoritarian control. \n\nThis week Vice President JD Vance revealed that he wants Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of the Post, to hand over control of his newsroom to Matthew Boyle, an editor at the conservative media outlet Breitbart. “I am being dead serious,” Vance said in a Nov. 20 fireside chat with Boyle that was livestreamed on the White House YouTube channel, calling him “the most well-sourced journalist in Washington, D.C.” \n\nShortly after Trump returned to the White House, Bezos announced a “significant shift” of the Post’s opinion page to focus on “free markets and personal liberties.” Vance admitted that he reached out to the publisher then with his recommendation. “I texted Jeff Bezos and I said, ‘If you’re really serious about this, you should just hire Matt Boyle and make him run your entire political reporting shop… Unfortunately for the Washington Post, they did not take my advice.”\n\nIt doesn’t matter that Bezos was unlikely ever to take Vance’s unsolicited recommendation. The vice president’s public flattery of Boyle flaunts the fact that the far-right Breitbart staffer is not a marginal voice. Although he is not in control of the Post’s political coverage, Boyle sat beside the vice president this week as a central ideologue for MAGA’s media takeover movement. Vance’s bragging about his direct political intervention into the Post newsroom is intended to reveal MAGA’s control and normalize backchannel influence.\n\n“We’re doing what’s called journalism,” Boyle said earlier this year of his website, which infamously featured a “Black crime” vertical. The mainstream media, he said, are “doing what’s called propaganda.” His antipathy toward legitimate news outlets isn’t new. In a 2017 speech, Boyle declared that “the goal eventually is the full destruction and elimination of the entire mainstream media…We envision a day where CNN is no longer in business; we envision a day where the New York Times closes its doors.”\n\nWant more sharp takes on politics? Sign up for our free newsletter, Standing Room Only, written by Amanda Marcotte, now also a weekly show on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nThis week, the Guardian reported that Larry Ellison, a major stakeholder in Paramount Skydance — which is owned by his son David — held informal talks with White House officials about a potential CNN takeover. Paramount Skydance is currently trying to force Warner Bros. Discovery, CNN’s parent company, to sell the network to him, Ellison has reportedly floated the idea of firing CNN hosts who are critical of Trump, including Erin Burnett and Brianna Keilar, to sweeten the deal. \n\nSuch an arrangement would undoubtedly thrill Trump, who is widely seen as favoring CNN’s acquisition by Paramount Skydance over an anticipated bid by Comcast. Earlier this year, Paramount Skydance, which owns CBS News, paid the president a $16 million settlement over a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that he claimed was deceptively edited. Meanwhile, Trump has called Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts a “disgrace” to broadcasting.\n\nThe reported push behind closed doors comes after the president publicly demanded the firing of another CNN reporter. In June, correspondent Natasha Bertrand reported on air that an internal intelligence assessment found that U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran’s nuclear program by only a few months. “She should be IMMEDIATELY reprimanded, and then thrown out ‘like a dog,’” Trump posted on Truth Social.\n\nThis week’s revelations made it clear: MAGA’s effort to restructure mainstream media from the inside out is not just focused on the opinion pages, but also on newsrooms themselves. Institutional capture through ownership, power over personnel and regulatory instruments to exert control over mass media is a defining characteristic of fascism. Trump has long referred to the press as the “enemy of the people,” a phrase that has a brutal history with its use by authoritarians including Josef Stalin, Mao Zedong and Nazi propagandists like Joseph Goebbels. The president’s contempt for a free, independent press tells us where his loyalties lie — and what a bleak future could hold.",

It’s easier than explaining.” pic.twitter.com/RfKJd6vAs1\n— Kaitlan Collins (@kaitlancollins) November 21, 2025\n\nThe deadpan exchange has ricocheted across social media as a perfect encapsulation of the odd, stiff-smiling dynamic between two politicians who recently spent months raging against each other online.\n\nThe moment caps off a bitter, deeply personal mayoral race in which Trump went all-in for Mamdani’s opponent, Democrat Andrew Cuomo. Trump not only endorsed Cuomo but amplified MAGA-world attacks on Mamdani, who endured relentless online harassment for being Muslim, an immigrant and outspoken on Gaza. Right-wing influencers cast him as “anti-American,” and pro-Israel groups labeled him antisemitic, making Mamdani a daily target for weeks.\n\nThat history is what made this Oval Office meeting — cordial, almost warm — so jarring. Mamdani told reporters his team initiated the meeting because collaboration was possible “so long as it was to the benefit of the eight and a half million people that call this city their home.” He said he and Trump discussed affordability issues: rent, groceries, utilities and displacement pressures on working-class New Yorkers.\n\nDespite having previously called out Trump on his authoritarian policies, Mamdani said he appreciated that the meeting focused less on ideological clashes and more on “the shared purpose … of serving New Yorkers.” Trump, for his part, shrugged off labels like “fascist,” saying, “I’ve been called much worse.”\n\nStart your day with essential news from Salon.\nSign up for our free morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nThe encounter has prompted a wave of analysis: Is this an unlikely policy alignment, a moment of strategic politics, or simply Trump’s recurring fixation on well-liked young male politicians he once attacked? For Mamdani, the “fascist” question may have been a deliberate stress test. For Trump, permitting the label fits his current malleable strongman performance.\n\nEither way, the meeting has already become a defining image of the race: two adversaries emerging from a brutal campaign, suddenly sitting shoulder-to-shoulder in the Oval Office — and agreeing, oddly enough, on what to call the president.",

        "text": "We are just under a week away from Thanksgiving, and while here in the northern part of the country, it is getting a bit cooler, the political temperature is heating up. Thankfully, that keeps those of us who live where it actually gets cold, and are observers of the political shenanigans going on in the United States of America, warm by default.\n\nAs most of you already know, the new hero of the communist/socialist eye is a fella by the name of Zohran Mamdani, who was just elected as New York City Mayor and has yet to take office. He met with President Trump on Friday at the White House, and it was not as much of a cluster, you know, as the mainstream media had hoped for.\n\nMy colleague Jennifer Oliver O'Connell wrote about this historic meeting yesterday, and I suggest you take a look at it (see Art of the Deal: Trump Meets With NYC Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani, Says: 'He's Gonna Change').\n\nHere in the Midwest, we occasionally need to pay attention to what is happening on the \"other left coast\" to get an idea of what may come our way one day soon. Which is where Michigan state Representative David Martin (R-Davison) had some thoughts that I agreed with, and I thought I would explore them here with you all.\n\nFrom his piece in the Detroit News called, The American Dream still outshines socialism, which it does.\n\nRepresentative Martin starts on point with...\n\nSocialism is enjoying a strange resurgence in American politics. New York City’s newly elected mayor, Zohran Mamdani, calls himself a “democratic socialist.” A recent Gallup survey shows that 39% of Americans, including 66% of Democrats and 51% of independents, now say they approve of socialism.\n\nHe's just being nice here. Nobody approves of free stuff if they think, down the line, somebody that they know (or they themselves) is going to have to pay for it.\n\nREAD MORE: Comrade Mamdani's Chinese Help\n\nSocialists Reportedly Pushing Mamdani to Make NYC a BDS Battleground\n\nThe whole idea is that the people who get free things believe that no one they know have to pay the tab. Of course, there are always exceptions to the rule, but that is the general idea behind it. They 100 percent don't believe they'll ever be held accountable, and as long as someone in their very close circle isn't stuck with the bill, either, they do not really care. If that ever changes, all hell will break loose.\n\nMartin continues...\n\nAll of us want to be rewarded for our own efforts. We want the dignity that comes from charting our own path, taking risks, creating value and providing for our families. Under socialism, the connection between effort and reward is weakened or erased altogether. When that happens, initiative withers and opportunities shrink.This point was understood long ago by Frédéric Bastiat, the 19th-century French economist who wrote that “life, liberty, and property do not exist because men have made laws. On the contrary, it was the fact that life, liberty, and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place.” Bastiat recognized that the role of government is to protect our natural rights rather than control them.\n\nFrédéric Bastiat is a name I have only come across before, but now I want to take some time to read his book, The Law, and dig deeper, and possibly learn something. That he is French, and so am I, could not hurt.\n\nWhile some may be shocked that the 47th president of the United States sat down with anybody who has the term \"socialist\" after his name is understandable. Yet, unfortunately, that is the current climate we live in, and to Trump's credit, he realizes this and correctly chose to meet with the future mayor of New York City. \n\nTrump, in a private meeting that he and Mamdani had, was able to size him up, and I'm sure the president took a read of the man to see who was going to be leading his former city. \n\nMaybe, if we are lucky, POTUS had the chance to relay to the soon-to-be mayor a lil nugget that Representative Martin from my home state ended his editorial with...\n\nCapitalism, grounded in liberty and personal responsibility, remains the greatest engine of opportunity the world has ever known. It is still the best path forward for our children, our communities and our country.\n\nCapitalism is STILL the best path forward for the United States of America, and the future mayor of New York just met with one of capitalism's biggest proponents. Let's hope it works.\n\nIf not, then New York City will be roasting more than turkey next Thanksgiving.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy RedState’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

Some viewers of Friday's press conference — including Trump critic Lee — were left surprised by the amicable nature of the meeting between the two men, who had been engaged in a war of words since Mamdani emerged as the mayoral front-runner. \"[During the election, Trump] called him a communist and said New York City was going to go down the drain,\" Lee said at the festival's press conference, as reported by Variety. \"I mean, the President said he was going to cut off federal funding. So from the things that were said to this quick turnaround… I’m puzzled.\" TRUMP, MAMDANI SET TO FACE-OFF IN FIRST OVAL OFFICE MEETING — WHAT’S ON THE TABLE The film director continued, recalling the previous warnings from Trump about what would happen to New York City if Mamdani were to win the mayorship. \"When you go back and see what the President said about him, and what would happen to New York City if [Mamdani] won, it just seems… It seems like they somehow found common ground,\" he noted. Turning his attention to others who predicted the city would become a disaster if Mamdani were to become mayor, Lee said, \"There were a lot of people saying if Mamdani won, they were going to leave New York City. Now, I really want the real numbers if anybody actually left!\" In 2024, ahead of the presidential election, Lee called the prospect of Trump’s reelection a ‘doomsday’ scenario. TRUMP PREDICTS 'CIVIL' MEETING WITH MAMDANI DESPITE PAST COMMENTS ABOUT EACH OTHER While many would have expected fireworks during Friday's joint press conference, the pair found unity during their meeting, with Trump telling the media the pair share the mission of a better New York City. \"We have one thing in common,\" Trump said Friday. \"We want this city of ours that we love to do very well. And I wanted to congratulate the mayor. He really ran an incredible race against, you know, a lot of smart people, starting with the early primaries against some very tough people, very smart people. And he beat them, and he beat them easily. And I congratulated him, and we talked about some things in very strong common, like housing and getting housing built and food and prices.\" The president and mayor-elect met at the White House Friday afternoon before opening the Oval Office doors to the media for questions. Trump predicted New York City, his hometown, will get a \"great mayor\" while remarking that the White House would be there to assist. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE \"I think you're going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor and the better he does, the happier I am,\" Trump said. \"I will say there's no difference in party, there's no difference in anything. And we're going to be helping him, to make everybody's dream come true, having a strong and very safe New York.\" Trump remained seated during his press event, while Mamdani stood by his side and fielded a handful of questions. The pair shared a hopeful outlook for the future, with Trump arguing that, despite their political differences, they will work together and also share a handful of priorities, namely affordability and lowering the cost of living for Americans. The mayor-elect added that he was appreciative of the meeting and said it largely focused on how to better New York City and help families struggling with costs.

After winning the primary in June, Trump denounced Mamdani as a dangerous “communist lunatic” who would destroy New York City, while the left continues to grapple with what Mamdani means for various movements.\n\nMany said Mamdani was effectively promising voters the moon with no way of delivering, and others have criticized him for appearing to walk back several of his campaign promises, such as leaving NYPD Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch in her position. Mamdani also joined Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York in discouraging a primary challenge to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, saying that challenger Chi Ossé, who campaigned for Mamdani, “should remain a councilman” and “focus…right here on New York City.”\n\nThe meeting also took place after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a resolution on Friday morning to condemn “the horrors of socialism,” with a majority of Democrats joining Republicans in support. The resolution passed in a 285-98 vote.\n\nPresident Donald Trump meets with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in the Oval Office of the White House on November 21 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\nWhat To Know\n\nThe meeting between Mamdani and Trump on Friday at the White House garnered national attention as many expected the president to effectively steamroll the novice mayor-elect, only to surprisingly see the pair in the Oval Office smiling and joking with each other—including Trump saying he was okay with Mamdani calling him a fascist because it was “easier than explaining” his view to reporters.\n\nTrump told reporters he would be comfortable living in Mamdani’s New York City, “especially after the meeting,” and that the pair had more in common with their goals and political views than the president had thought.\n\nIn the aftermath of Friday’s meeting, outlet World Socialist Web Site (WSWS) heavily criticized Mamdani for his “grotesque love-fest” with Trump at the White House, which included Mamdani pledging to work with “would-be dictator” Trump.\n\n“This of an administration that is carrying out an unrelenting assault on the working class, slashing food stamps, threatening Social Security and Medicare, destroying public education, waging a war on public health and orchestrating the largest transfer of wealth from the working class to the oligarchy in American history,” Joseph Kishore wrote on WSWS, going on to criticize Mamdani’s response to Trump on immigration, police, and Israel.\n\n“Mamdani bent over backwards to avoid any mild criticism of Trump,” he wrote, adding of the moment when Mamdani was asked about calling Trump a fascist that “Mamdani allowed Trump to respond for him…thus the pair jointly agreed that Trump is a fascist, but that this would be no hinderance to their blooming ‘partnership.'”\n\nMeanwhile, Jacobin, a New York-based socialist magazine, highlighted that Mamdani’s “unmistakable charisma and undeniable popularity” has created “a flurry of contradictory reactions from opponents,” which includes “slapping Mamdani with a seal of approval” after their meeting. \n\n“Mamdani’s political opponents are threatened by his unapologetic democratic socialism, and they’re trying a range of strategies to neutralize it,” Ben Burgis wrote. \n\nBurgis argued that the meeting with Trump was sensible, showing Mamdani is willing to work with the federal government, but that Trump’s “dramatic pivot” might reflect a broader appeal of the mayor-elect’s policies and the dissatisfaction of voters with the state of the country as a whole, something Trump is grappling with amid fluctuating jobs reports and competing analysis about the health of the economy.\n\n“When it comes to the politics of the here and now, though, the plain fact is that most Americans don’t find what democratic socialists are proposing particularly horrifying. And at least for the moment, that puts reactionaries like Trump on the back foot,” Burgis wrote. \n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nNew York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani wrote on X on Friday: “Working people have been left behind in New York. In the wealthiest city in the world, one in five can’t afford $2.90 for the train or bus. As I...",

What’s your reaction to what we saw with this essentially, embrace from the president to the mayor-elect and a back?”\n\nRaskin said, “The House Republicans literally kept the entire House of Representatives in session today for one purpose and one purpose only, which was to vote on their resolution denouncing and deploring the horrors of socialism. They even conscripted Thomas Jefferson and James Madison to the cause, even though they died before the word socialism was even being used. But in any event, while we were being forced to vote on that utterly ridiculous resolution essentially offending all of our allies in Sweden and Denmark and Norway and Finland and so on, the president was praising Mamdani as a great mayor and someone who is very rational and could be dealt with in the meantime. Again, the Republicans in Congress and Donald Trump were moving in completely opposite directions.”\n\n Follow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN",

        "text": "President Donald Trump on Friday welcomed the announcement by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) that she will resign from Congress in January, characterizing the decision as a positive development and signaling no intention to repair their strained relationship.\n\nIn a phone conversation with ABC’s Senior Political Correspondent Abby Scott, President Trump responded to news of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s resignation by saying, “I think it’s great news for the country. It’s great.”\n\nWhen asked if Greene had given him advance notice of her plans, he replied, “Nah, it doesn’t matter, you know, but I think it’s great. I think she should be happy.” When asked about the “rift” between them, Trump remarked, “only between me and her, not her and me,” and indicated he does not currently intend to speak with her, though he wishes her well.\n\nGreene, who was first elected in 2020 and built her brand as an outspoken supporter of Trump and the “America First” agenda, posted her resignation on X, citing disillusionment with both major parties and declaring that “nothing ever gets better” for ordinary Americans. In her statement, she criticized what she described as the bipartisan failure of Washington, DC, to address issues such as rising debt, the outsourcing of American jobs, and a lack of meaningful legislative progress.\n\nTrump’s withdrawal of support, made public last week on Truth Social, preceded this announcement. In the post, he wrote, “all I see ‘Wacky’ Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!” He pointed to a poll advising her not to run for higher office without his endorsement, claiming “she was at 12%, and didn’t have a chance,” and added that she “has told many people that she is upset” he no longer returns her phone calls.\n\nAs Greene exits the House of Representatives, Trump shifted focus during his phone call with ABC’s Abby Scott, redirecting attention to his Oval Office meeting on Friday with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.\n\nTrump called the meeting “great,” and emphasized the “good chemistry” between them. “He couldn’t be nicer,” Trump said of Mamdani.\n\nDuring the meeting, Trump praised Mamdani, saying, “I really think there’s a chance to do a great job,” and added that he would help him. After tossing a question to Mamdani about whether he considers himself the leader of the Democrats, Trump stated, “This is a man that right now, I think, is focused on New York City.”",

        "text": "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) didn’t mince her words toward Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) on Friday after the MAGA Republican continued her spree of Islamophobic attacks against New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.\n\nStefanik — who is running for governor and looks to challenge Hochul as she seeks a second full term next year — seemingly distanced herself from Donald Trump after the president praised Mamdani in their Oval Office meeting, one where Trump dismissed Stefanik’s “jihadist” label for the mayor-elect.\n\n“We all want NYC to succeed. But we’ll have to agree to disagree on this one,” wrote Stefanik on X before leaning into an attack she’s repeatedly hurled at Mamdani since his mayoral primary upset in June.\n\n“If he walks like a jihadist If he talks like a jihadist If he campaigns like a jihadist If he supports jihadists, He’s a jihadist. And he’s @KathyHochul ’s jihadist.”\n\nHochul — who declined to endorse Mamdani for months before eventually doing so in September, when she wrote that she’s looking for the next mayor to not “surrender” to Trump — hit back at Stefanik in a live interview on MS NOW.\n\n“She’s full of shit,” Hochul told host Chris Hayes before swiftly checking herself. “I’m sorry. I mean she really is.”\n\nHochul stressed that Stefanik is taking “such an extreme position.”\n\n“She’s even more extreme than Donald Trump. I didn’t think that was possible but she’s succeeded in proving that today,” she said. “She’s out-MAGA’d Donald Trump, the founder of the MAGA movement.”\n\nHochul sarcastically added that she hopes Stefanik is “proud of herself” for “continuing to spew hateful thoughts and deeds” as well as trying to spread more violent, political rhetoric.\n\n“I think it’s disgusting, it’s abhorrent, but that’s who she is and people are seeing this and even the president realized that’s even too far for him.”",

        "text": "From shocked to bemused to barely surprised — New Yorkers voiced a gamut of reactions after watching President Donald Trump’s unexpected embrace of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in the Oval Office Friday.\n\nBut the biggest question for many was: How is this going to play in 2026?\n\nRepublicans nationwide have been planning to use Mamdani as the poster boy for liberalism run amok, but on Friday Trump told reporters he was confident that Mamdani “can do a good job. I think he is going to surprise some conservative people actually.”\n\nPerhaps nowhere did the unexpected praise land more awkwardly than in the New York governor’s race where Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik has been relentlessly trying to tie Gov. Kathy Hochul to Mamdani since Hochul endorsed the incoming mayor in September.\n\nImmediately following Friday’s press conference, Stefanik dug in further.\n\nShe posted a short note on X calling Mamdani “@KathyHochul’s jihadist” and saying she’d “have to agree to disagree on this one” with the president — a rare departure from someone whose political identity is largely defined by Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement.\n\nHochul hit back during a Friday night interview with Chris Hayes.\n\n“She's full of sh-t,” Hochul said. “I'm sorry, I mean she really is. This is such an extreme position ... She's even more extreme than Donald Trump. I didn't think that was possible.”\n\nAs for the meeting itself, Hochul said she wasn’t “terribly surprised” by what unfolded.\n\nShe said it was always her hope the president “would see in Zohran Mamdani someone who can lead the city, who is focused on public safety, who is working on affordability and quality of life issues, and to give the president — who is a New Yorker, who cares about the city — the confidence to know that he can lead.”\n\nChris Coffey, a political strategist who worked for Mayor Michael Bloomberg, said Trump’s change of tone was politically expedient – and that it could undermine Stefanik’s gubernatorial bid. Republicans are still shaking off the government shutdown and the Democratic election victories in New York, New Jersey and elsewhere earlier this month.\n\n“And so the political winds have changed a little bit,” Coffey said. “The shutdown was not popular for the Republican Party and [Trump] likes a winner.”\n\nDoubling down on the jihadist line won’t do Stefanik any favors, he added. That sort of rhetoric “plays to the farthest right of the Republican Party. New York is a blue state … And now that the president has expressed a willingness to work with him and validated Mamdani, it makes it a lot harder to rally Republicans.”\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio also noted that the encounter served Trump’s immediate political needs — citing his declining poll numbers and the fallout from the recently released Epstein files — but that can and will change.\n\n“For Mamdani, it was the right thing to do as a leader, but I know he went into it with no illusions about Trump,” de Blasio said. “This is just a moment in time. By next week, they could be at loggerheads easily … This is not gonna be a chummy relationship, I guarantee it.”\n\nSusan Kang, a political science professor at John Jay College and a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, acknowledged the president’s pattern of being blustery in one breath while trying to charm in the next.\n\nWhile it seems unlikely that this new political romance will last, Kang said she’s sensing some cautious optimism.\n\n“There was a lot of fear that Trump would try to destroy this administration, but the evidence suggests that he's not gonna do that,” she said. “In fact, maybe he'll send, maybe he'll reinstate some federal aid, maybe he'll send extra money to build housing.”",

        "text": "Rep. Nydia Velázquez knew it was time to retire when Zohran Mamdani won the New York City mayoral race.\n\n“What I saw during that election was that so many young people were hungry for a change and that they have a clear-eyed view of the problems we face and how to fix them,” Velázquez, D-N.Y., told The Intercept. “That helped convince me that this was the right time to pass the torch.”\n\nVelázquez, a native of Puerto Rico who has served in Congress for more than 30 years, announced her retirement Thursday, in the early days of what is sure to be a frenzied 2026 midterm season across the country and in several solidly Democratic New York districts. She was not facing a notable primary challenger, unlike her House colleagues Hakeem Jeffries, Ritchie Torres, and Adriano Espaillat: three younger New York congressmen who are all considered firmly in line with the Democratic establishment, and all facing challenges from their left.\n\n“She could be in that seat as long as she wants,” said Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, a longtime ally whom Velázquez once described as one of her “children.” “Nydia is at her peak. So that she would go out like that — it’s so Nydia.”\n\nVelázquez is known as something of a den mother for a generation of younger progressive politicians in Brooklyn. She is overwhelmingly popular in her district but made few friends in the local establishment’s clubby machine politics. As Brooklyn’s electorate shifted left over the decades, she built up a formidable stable of protégés in key roles.\n\n“My goal was never to build a machine,” she said. “My goal was to build a bench of strong, independent, progressive public servants who understood who they work for.”\n\nThat will likely set up a competitive race to succeed Velázquez in her left-leaning 7th Congressional District, which includes Mamdani’s home base of Astoria, Queens, and solidly progressive Brooklyn neighborhoods like Bushwick, Williamsburg, and Clinton Hill. The district’s progressive profile means it’s poised to become a hot contest for candidates on the left — and may distract from the controversial candidacy of City Council Member Chi Ossé, who’s waging a long-shot challenge against Jeffries that has mired the city’s Democratic Socialists of America in debate.\n\nVelázquez declined to say who, if anyone, she favored to become her replacement.\n\n“I could leave today and know that the district will be in good hands,” she said.\n\nVelázquez is bowing out at a moment when the “G word” — gerontocracy — can be heard frequently on cable news, and not just on the lips of younger political hopefuls frustrated by an aging party leadership. She joins fellow Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, who announced his decision to retire in September and who has already kicked off a wild, 10-way primary fight in his Upper West Side district.\n\n“She told me she wanted to send a message to Democrats across the country that it is time for the next generation,” said City Council Member Lincoln Restler, a protégé. “Still, every elected official I’ve spoken to is just sad that we’re losing this remarkable moral leader.”\n\nVelázquez saw Mamdani’s promise so early in the mayoral race that she was predicting his win well before many of her younger acolytes did, Reynoso told The Intercept.\n\n“Nydia was always like ‘Zohran is the one, and I think he can win,’” Reynoso said.\n\nAt Mamdani’s victory celebration on November 4, Velázquez was happy to flaunt her prediction. When one supporter joyfully asked if she could believe it, she replied: “I believed it a year ago.”\n\nVelázquez, 72, was first elected in 1992, unseating a nine-term incumbent in the Democratic primary to become the first Puerto Rican woman to serve in Congress. At the time of her primary victory, the New York Times offered readers a guide to the phonetic pronunciation of her name.\n\n“When Nydia Velázquez was first elected to Congress, it was her against the world,” said Restler. “She took on the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, and the entrenched political power in Brooklyn was entirely against her.”\n\nIn 2010, Restler said, “she told me she felt genuinely lonely in Brooklyn, that she had so few allies that she could count on. Fifteen years later, essentially every single person in local and state elected office across her district is there because of her validation, her legitimization, and her support.”\n\nIn the wake of her announcement on Thursday, praise for Velázquez poured in not just from her mentors and close ideological allies, but also from establishment figures closer to the center as well. On X, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called the outgoing congresswoman a “trailblazer” — a hint perhaps at the stable of potential left-wing contenders Velázquez has helped take the playing field over the years.",
