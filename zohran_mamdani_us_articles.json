        "text": "The Community Opportunity to Purchase Act (COPA) will give community land trusts and other community groups first dibs at buying distressed properties. Supporters expect it to pass with support from housing officials.\n\nIt’s been a long time coming.\n\nOver five years after it was first proposed, the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act (COPA) is expected to pass the City Council before the end of the year. The bill would give groups like community land trusts and tenant associations the first opportunity to bid on some apartment buildings when they go up for sale.\n\nThe idea has long had the backing of groups that preserve affordable housing, but has encountered resistance from the real estate industry and city housing officials. But in a deal being finalized this week, the city’s housing agency is finally getting on board, sources say.\n\nCouncilmember Sandy Nurse, the bill’s sponsor, said the legislation is “a great opportunity to preserve more housing.”\n\n“We need COPA because New Yorkers are leaving,” she said. “People are just looking to have an affordable apartment and they can’t compete. And so we want to give our community a chance to stay.”\n\nCOPA would be another tool in the toolkit for Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who has made social housing—which looks to put more housing in the hands of the city and community groups, rather than the private market—a part of his platform.\n\nIf passed, New York would join Washington, D.C. and San Francisco as cities with community opportunity to purchase laws on the books. Those policies have sometimes been criticized for disrupting an already complex housing market—criticisms echoed by COPA’s opponents.\n\n“This is government-engineered interference in private free-market transactions that eliminates negotiation and clearly gives a right-of-first-refusal advantage to a select list of city-sanctioned nonprofits,” Ann Korchak, board president of the Small Property Owners of New York, said in a statement this week.\n\nBut the bill has the support of the majority of the City Council, sources say, as lawmakers finalize a version the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) can get behind.\n\nA spokesperson for the mayor’s office did not immediately respond to questions about whether City Hall would support the bill.\n\n“The coalition has made the case,” said Nurse, who said the bill’s 32 co-sponsers and dozens of the city’s community development corporations pushed the issue with HPD. “I think that has forced everyone’s feet to the fire.”\n\nThe agreement is expected to trim the universe of eligible buildings somewhat from what was originally proposed. To qualify, buildings must be in “distress”—meaning that they have a certain number of housing code violations—or have an affordability provision that is expiring.\n\nSmaller landlords would be carved out: owner-occupied buildings with less than six units would not be eligible, nor would any building with three units or less.\n\nSources say HPD pushed for the universe of eligible buildings to be limited to those in distress and to exempt smaller landlords.\n\nBut Korchak said that those concessions don’t make up for the other impacts of the bill: “It doesn’t really do anything to protect small building operators—somebody with a six to 35 unit building.”\n\nShe argued that buildings are in distress because of policies like rent stabilization that limit the amount of income buildings can generate. \n\n“I look at buildings that are on those tax lien sales lists, ones that are behind on water and sewer bills, ones that are on that alternate enforcement program—they are often there because city and state policies are dysfunctional,” said Korchak.*\n\nHPD was opposed to the bill as recently as June, when councilmembers told City Limits they were frustrated with the agency. Housing officials worried prior versions of the legislation would disrupt the housing market, slow an already bureaucratic process, and potentially disadvantage smaller landlords.\n\nHPD did not confirm or deny that it would support the bill, but sources say the agency helped shape the latest version.\n\n“Whenever legislation is proposed that may significantly impact the housing landscape, we are committed to providing input and feedback to ensure that all potential effects are fully considered,” said Matt Rauschenbach, HPD’s press secretary.\n\nWith the revised bill, owners with properties covered by the law who plan to sell would have to notify the city. Potential buyers would then have 45 days to inform the seller they plan to bid for the building before it goes up for sale to the general public. Buyers can be nonprofit groups like community land trusts, affordable housing developers, or—added at HPD’s request—for profit developers specializing in affordable housing preservation.\n\nCOPA is being considered alongside two other social housing bills. The first would create a city land bank to acquire and develop property. The second would change the process for auctioning city liens, requiring Council approval for competitive sales and enabling sales to the land bank. \n\nUnlike COPA, those bills don’t have the support of city agencies that would be involved in administering them. A smaller package of reforms recommended by the Council’s Temporary Task Force on Tax Liens looks more likely to pass.\n\nPotential buyers, landlords, and policymakers are particularly interested in how COPA could impact distressed rent stabilized buildings.\n\nLandlord groups say some buildings fall into disrepair because rents are not high enough for owners to keep up with rising expenses. They say policies like Mayor-elect Mamdani’s rent freeze proposal will exacerbate the problem.\n\nBut the bill’s supporters see it as part of a solution, allowing groups that are interested in preserving affordable housing to acquire those buildings, instead of speculators.\n\n“Rather than having your building sold, and then being unclear who you’re writing your rent check to every month, a trusted community based entity could come in, purchase that building and co-govern the housing with tenants,” said Will Spisak, a senior policy strategist with the New Economy Project.\n\nSome nonprofit housing organizations like the Community Preservation Corporation, Enterprise Community Partners, and The Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development have also been sounding the alarm about preservation needs in the city’s affordable housing stock.\n\n“There should be a preservation strategy in [Mamdani’s] housing plan,” Cea Weaver, head of the New York State Tenant Bloc told City Limits earlier this month.\n\nNonprofits or tenants that buy those buildings might have the same revenue problems as previous ownership, though. “We’ve been pushing HPD to keep the universe focused on distress, but not so distressed to the point where they’re setting everyone up for failure,” said Spisak.\n\nTo make COPA work for those severely distressed buildings, supporters suggested the bill be used in tandem with some of HPD’s other programs backed with funding to support community ownership and aid distressed buildings, like the Neighborhood Pillars program.\n\nJohn Leyva lives in a building financed with low income housing tax credits at 63 Tiffany Place in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. But the regulatory agreement on his building is expiring, meaning a for-profit developer could take over and raise rents.\n\n“[This bill] would have saved my building once already,” said Leyva, who wants the tenant association to be able to take over. “[The new landlord] wanted to raise the rents and kick us all out of this place. We organized a lot, but it’s been super hard because we don’t have something like COPA that will make it easier for a building like ours.”\n\n*This story was updated after publication to include comment from Small Property Owners of New York. \n\nTo reach the reporter behind this story, contact [email protected].

        "text": "By MICHAEL R. SISAK\n\nJERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) — Former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey’s bid for a political comeback comes down to a one-on-one runoff Tuesday against an opponent who has denounced him and his scandal-stained exit from the governor’s office two decades ago as the epitome of “politics of the past.”\n\nMcGreevey and James Solomon are the last candidates standing in a race for mayor of Jersey City, a community across the Hudson River from Manhattan that is sometimes referred to as New York City’s sixth borough. Like last month’s elections in New York and elsewhere, the race has focused heavily on affordability, particularly the high cost of housing.\n\nThe contest advanced to a runoff after no candidate tallied more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 4 general election, when seven people were on the ballot. Solomon, a city council member since 2017, finished first. McGreevey placed second. Both are Democrats, though the race is nonpartisan. Polls close at 8 p.m.\n\nMcGreevey is running for public office for the first time since he resigned as governor in 2004 — a stunning announcement remembered mostly for the spectacle of him declaring: “I am a gay American.” His exit was driven in part by controversy over his decision to hire a man he said was his lover, ex-Israeli naval officer Golan Cipel, as the state’s homeland security adviser in 2002 despite Cipel’s lack of qualifications.\n\nHe launched his mayoral campaign in 2023 with a social media video titled: “Second chances are central to who I am.”\n\n“I want Jersey City to be Jersey City,” McGreevey said in a recent interview. “That is: an iconic city in the Garden State reflecting the hopes and the aspirations of families.”\n\nMcGreevey, 68, has pledged to be a one-term mayor, calling it “a great closing act” on his career. He has touted his experience as an elected leader — both as governor and before that as mayor of suburban Woodbridge Township — and said he’d back Solomon for mayor in four years.\n\nSolomon, 41, said McGreevey’s background is “experience we don’t want.”\n\n“There were just scandal after scandal after scandal,” Solomon said in a recent interview. “That, to me, is disqualifying.”\n\nThe race to run New Jersey’s second-largest city has centered on the cost of living, echoing national concerns. New downtown development catering to affluent New York City commuters is driving overall prices higher, and the city is struggling with a budget shortfall that threatens to hike property taxes. New York City’s mayor-elect, democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, won last month on an affordability platform over another ex-governor looking to make a comeback, Andrew Cuomo.\n\nJersey City is a swath of high-rises and immigrant neighborhoods with about 303,000 residents and a municipal budget of about $700 million. The current mayor, Steven Fulop, declined to seek a fourth term.\n\nMcGreevey has spent about $2.5 million on his campaign. Solomon has spent about $1.3 million.\n\nBoth candidates have vowed to stand up to President Donald Trump, whose administration is suing to end Jersey City’s so-called sanctuary city protections for immigrants.\n\n“If Donald Trump chooses a fight, we’re not going to back down,” Solomon said.\n\nMcGreevey was born in Jersey City and returned to live there in 2015. It’s where his grandfather sought a new life after being forced out of Northern Ireland and where he’s made a new life for himself.\n\nAfter a divorce, McGreevey attended an Episcopal seminary, earned a Master of Divinity degree, volunteered at a Harlem ministry and took steps to become a priest. He later moved into nonprofit work.\n\nHe’s currently executive director of the Jersey City-based New Jersey Reentry Corporation, a non-profit that helps formerly incarcerated people and returning veterans find work and housing.\n\nSolomon grew up in nearby Millburn, has a master’s degree from Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and was an aide to former Boston Mayor Thomas Menino.\n\nHe moved to Jersey City in 2013, is married and he and his wife have three daughters. In 2015, he was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. Now in full remission, he said that challenge inspired him to run for public office.\n\n“I had one of these life is short moments,” Solomon said. “I was like, ‘you know, I think I can do something. I can give back to Jersey City, because Jersey City really had my back during my toughest time.’”\n\nSolomon has vowed to take on developers and special interests, invest in public safety and work with the independent board of education to improve the city’s schools. He said he plans to build on legislation he passed as a council member, including banning rent-hiking algorithms and ensuring tenants have a right to legal counsel.\n\nAlong with affordability, McGreevey said, his immediate concern is an estimated $150 million budget hole that could hike property taxes 30% if not fixed.\n\nHe said he’ll devote his term to making sure “we’re on a road of fiscal sanity and to make sure that Jersey City’s working families aren’t driven out by the downtown crowd.”",

        "text": "Nearing Christmas, I often wonder how Christianity has become so institutionalized that its founder, Jesus of Nazareth, is almost an afterthought while his popularizer, the Pope, is busier than ever. The originator (Jesus) and the popularizer (Pope) represent the same ideas of Christianity; but, more often than not, the institutionalized version is so compromised by the reality in which it must exist that the original form is hardly detectable in the popularized version. \n\nJesus, the original-revolutionary founder speaks his ideas and leaves the stage, but the later popularizers, like popes, must spread the ideas in a way acceptable to multitudes. The problem is that we cannot traverse from the original revolution to later popularization without compromise and corruption, often to a point unrecognizable by the founder. \n\nJesus was simple and his disciples were honest; but the pope’s institution today is highly personalized and politicized with factions within fighting for their own interests and powers. Jesus lived among his people and talked to them; our popes — in an institution surrounded by thick walls and armed guards, immersed in archaic titles and protocols, live like feudal kings. Human history is replete with examples of the founders’ purity severely tainted, even forgotten, by the process of institutionalization and the power-play of its keepers. \n\nTake the example of the Declaration of Independence compromised into the Constitution of the United States. The Founders composed the Declaration purely as their ideals — such as in “all men are created equal” — conceived from their simple hearts. By the time the declared ideals were codified as the Constitution a decade later, the original ideals were pretty much muted into the demands of practicality as the Constitution had to be approved by practical men. Thomas Jefferson and his fellow writers could only declare their intentions of the heart. (Jefferson’s first draft even had a sweeping denunciation of slavery, which his colleagues vetoed as too radical). But the Constitution was a blueprint with which they had to actually build a real society in a real world.\n\nThe distance between Declaration and Constitution is about as wide as that between the founding generation and today’s largely corrupt compromisers and politicians, for whom every ideal is a deal first. New York City’s Jeffersonian mayor Zohran Mamdani must fight the housing oligarchs to lower their rents without quoting Jefferson’s declaration of equality, America’s first principle, now drowned in the sea of capitalism. \n\nIt’s inevitable that the road from revolutionaries to popularizers is paved with corruption. As Jesus would not recognize the Catholic Church today as the House of their Fathers, our Founders would not accept our contemporary generations as the rightful inheritors of their American ideals. Jefferson worried about George Washington going soft on the revolution’s radical republicanism; Hitler was unhappy that his victorious Nazi colleagues were forgetting about their radical national-socialist (Nazi) goals; Mao wanted to revive the sagging communists’ revolutionary spirit by turning the Red Guards loose on Chinese society. In every new revolutionary movement — Christianity, liberalism, national-socialism, communism — the original ideas are soon watered down, even abandoned, by their institutional administrators and citizens. \n\nThe founders of any movements — spiritual, political, philosophical — uncompromising and pure at heart — need popularizers to bridge the distance between the epiphany of the movements and their repeats by habit. But as the time-space distance widens between the two — Jesus from Christianity, Jefferson from America — the original purity cannot escape the ensuing compromise and corruption. So Jesus sees his “churches” everywhere but the spirit that fills them is far removed (institutionalized) from his original commandment. In American politics today, it’s doubtful that Thomas Jefferson and his cohort would find any kinship with our democracy practiced in their name. \n\nSome more contrasts are instructional: Henry David Thoreau, the purest and most demanding soul in New England, thought his fellow transcendentalist and popular speaker Ralph Waldo Emerson had become corrupted in popularity; disappointed with Emerson, Thoreau quit the group. \n\nJohn Brown, the abolitionist, could not persuade Frederick Douglas, who was a popular celebrity-speaker in Boston, to join him in the armory attack; the attack failed and Brown was soon hanged; Frederick Douglas lived comfortably for three more decades while John Brown’s death inspired the Civil War.\n\nMalcolm X was the uncompromising radical who would accept only pure-hearted whites as true brothers; but Martin Luther King Jr., the popular preacher, compromised with white society to be more acceptable; and today, white America shuns Malcolm X’s pure heart, MLK is showered with honors and celebrations, and quoting something from “Dr. King” is fashionable among liberals. \n\nPopes, the vicars of Christ, could not even theatrically imitate Jesus; nor could modern American politicians or their voters imagine the Founders’ perfect union; nor could Emerson live like Thoreau; nor could Douglas die a martyr’s death like Brown; nor could MLK be true like Malcolm X. Beholden to their social institutions and realities, not to the original callings of the heart, popularizers can only pretend, not replicate, what they enact. To paraphrase Lord Acton: Popularity corrupts and institutionalized popularity corrupts more absolutely. Unsurprisingly, just now, Santa Claus and Christmas trees have overtaken Christ himself in importance. \n\nHow do we escape from this corruption trap? We must all become revolutionaries, 1776 style, and overthrow our present yoke: Rejecting “paganized-commercialized” Christmas is a start. We must save Christmas — and our own souls in the process — from the unremitting carnival straight from Sodom and Gomorrah that it has become. \n\nJesus would be the first to appreciate a simple but solemn prayer from our heart instead of extravagant gifts and loud parties concocted by our own money-changers in their den of thieves. \n\nJon Huer, retired professor and columnist, lives in Greenfield and writes for posterity.",

It’s Complicated\nMore Analysis\nReader Comments\nBest of Right Opinion\nBest of Videos\n\nToday’s Meme\n\nEXECUTIVE NEWS SUMMARY\n\nThe Editors\n\nU.S. military presence in Caribbean grows: As Donald Trump has been ratcheting up pressure on Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro in media statements, he’s followed it up with increased military presence in the region. Eleven U.S. warships, led by the carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, are steaming into the Caribbean. Trump has also deployed a Marine Expeditionary Unit capable of conducting a land assault. “Drugs kill more Americans than we’ve ever lost in wars,” Navy Secretary John Phelan explained. “So I think at the end of the day, the president has correctly identified this as an attack on the country.” This military buildup in the Caribbean is part of Trump’s Operation Southern Spear, whose aim is to stop the flow of illicit drugs into the U.S. Furthermore, Trump is reestablishing the Monroe Doctrine due to the increasing menace from China in the region.\nNashville-hating Democrat on the ballot in TN special election: Tennessee is holding a special election today to replace former Congressman Mark Green, who resigned in July. Republican Matt Van Epps, a decorated veteran and helicopter pilot who has been endorsed by President Trump and Gov. Bill Lee, might be expected to cruise to victory over a Democrat described as “our very own AOC of TN” in a district where Trump won 60% of the vote. However, Republican turnout in elections without Trump on the ballot has been very weak in recent years, and Democrats have poured over $1 million into Democrat Aftyn Behn’s campaign. Trump weighed in on Behn, calling her “a woman who hates Christianity,” using on-tape comments to pin her as anti-2A, pro-trans, and a hater of country music. Polls will close at 7 p.m. Central Time.\nGood news: National Guardsman awake after DC Islamic attack: Guardsman Andrew Wolfe, who was shot by an Islamist ahead of Thanksgiving, has clung to life and now can respond to nurses with a thumbs up and by wiggling his toes. U.S. Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, who was also a target of the Muslim attack, died of her wounds on Thanksgiving Day. In another era, an Afghan attacker who shouted “Allahu Akbar” before shooting National Guard members in our nation’s capital would be seen for what it is — Islamic terrorism. However, the Leftmedia struggles to use the words “terror,” “Muslim,” or “Islam” these days, or even to quote the attacker’s battle cry. Despite the horror, Staff Sgt. Wolfe’s continuing recovery is cause for thanksgiving and celebration by all Americans.\nNoem calls for travel ban: Following last week’s deadly attack in DC, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem on Monday called for a “full travel ban” to the U.S. from dozens of countries. Noem argued that these nations have “been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.” She added in a post on X, “Our forefathers built this nation on blood, sweat, and the unyielding love of freedom — not for foreign invaders to slaughter our heroes, suck dry our hard-earned tax dollars, or snatch the benefits owed to AMERICANS. WE DON’T WANT THEM. NOT ONE.” Noem has already acted to pause asylum claims from 19 countries in the wake of the attack. She also accused the Biden administration of “completely” abandoning the vetting process when it allowed people into the country.\n\nTrump MRI comes back clean: The media and politicians who refused to admit they had even the slightest worries about non compos mentis Joe Biden’s mental state are happy to invent health woes out of whole cloth for Donald Trump. Trump revealed that he underwent an MRI scan in October, and lefties jumped on it as their newest angle of attack. When Trump outlined the tremendous ongoing fraud in Minnesota and called Gov. Tim Walz “seriously retarded,” adding that he was doing nothing about it, Walz responded simply, “Release the MRI results.” Well, yesterday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did just that, going over the results with the press pool and handing out physical copies. According to the MRI, Trump’s cardiovascular imaging was “perfectly normal” and shows “excellent health.” The president is 79, so health checks are essential, but so far, there are no signs of concern.\nMamdani’s radical transition team: New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has been putting together his transition team, and predictably, it is filled with radical leftists who share his own Marxist ideology. For example, Mamdani named Alex Vitale, an anti-cop Brooklyn College sociology professor, to staff his Committee on Community Safety. Vitale even published a book titled The End of Policing in which he decried the proven “broken windows” policing strategy as reinforcing racism and inequality. The book also contains a chapter titled “The Police Are Not Here to Protect You.” Vitale is one of a basket of leftist radicals in Mamdani’s team, which also includes one “Abby” Stein, a male rabbi who identifies as a “trans-woman” who is on his Health Committee.\nRampant Minnesota Somali fraud aided by Tim Walz: Fourteen Medicare-funded programs in Minnesota were paused on October 31 due to fears of fraud. The New York Times reports that 59 people have already been convicted, and in three investigated cases so far, over $1 billion in state and federal taxpayer dollars have been stolen. The fraud may have been ignored due to fears of causing “political backlash among the Somali community,” says Kayseh Magan, a Somali-American fraud investigator. Ryan Pacyga, a lawyer defending an accused fraudster, adds, “It was like someone was stealing money from the cookie jar, and they kept refilling it.” Pacyga says some of the fraudsters were convinced the state agencies were tacitly allowing the fraud. As it turns out, Governor Tim Walz may have been doing exactly that. Nearly 500 Minnesota DHS employees are now calling out Walz for his knowledge and complicity in the fraud.\n\nAppeals court disqualifies Trump’s U.S. attorney in NJ: A three-judge panel of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on Monday that Donald Trump’s installation of Alina Habba as U.S. Attorney of New Jersey was improper and therefore disqualified her from continuing prosecutions. The court, however, did not toss out the cases Habba was prosecuting. Habba, who has served as Trump’s personal lawyer, was nominated by Trump for the position, and eventually she moved to “first assistant U.S. attorney” when the clock ran out. Judge D. Michael Fisher wrote that the Trump administration’s “efforts to elevate its preferred candidate … to the role of Acting U.S. attorney demonstrate the difficulties it has faced — yet the citizens of New Jersey and the loyal employees in the U.S. Attorney’s Office deserve some clarity and stability.”\nCanada joins EU defense fund, distancing itself from U.S.: In an effort to diversify its military spending away from the United States, Canada has joined a major European Defense fund called Security Action for Europe (SAFE). Canada is the first non-EU country to acquire access to the group. Prime Minister Mark Carney announced, “Canada’s participation in SAFE will fill key capability gaps, expand markets for Canadian suppliers, and attract European defense investment into Canada.” The plan gives Canadian defense companies access to a €150 billion ($170 billion) EU loan program, enabling them to secure cheap, EU-backed loans to procure military equipment. Carney said that the potential for more production in Canada is a factor in this decision, while also allowing him to make good on his promise that no longer will over 70 cents of every dollar of Canadian military spending go to the U.S.\n\nTSA to start charging travelers $45 if they don’t have Real ID (CBS News)\nDemocrats begin congressional probe of Kash Patel’s use of FBI Gulfstream jet (CBS News)\nSocial Security has less than eight years left (Hot Air)\nUniversities aren’t disclosing foreign funding — here’s what Trump plans to do about it (Daily Signal)\nHumor: Tim Walz offers journalists free tampons to stop talking about fraud Scandal (Babylon Bee)\n\nFor the Executive Summary archive, click here.\n\nComment | Share\n\nFEATURED ANALYSIS\n\n‘Kill Them All’? It’s Complicated\n\nNate Jackson\n\nWhen The Washington Post headlined that Secretary of War Pete Hegseth had given a “kill them all” order on the first Caribbean boat strike against Venezuelan drug cartels, the rest of the media launched nearly ubiquitous coverage of the supposed scandal. We opted for a wait-and-see approach because Leftmedia “scoops” like that have a way of being revised as time goes on.\n\nThe Post’s report, it admitted, “is based on interviews with and accounts from seven people with knowledge of the Sept. 2 strike and the overall operation.” In other words, anonymous sources who were not directly involved. Take that for what it’s worth. You can also consider the fact that the Post’s report comes not long after six Democrats posted an inciteful video urging Armed Forces personnel to disregard illegal or unconstitutional orders. Right on cue?\n\nThe Post essentially accused Hegseth and a Special Operations commander of a war crime — killing “two survivors [who] were clinging to the smoldering wreck.” The rest of the Leftmedia dutifully jumped aboard the same boat.\n\nDemocrat Senator Mark Kelly, one of the six Democrats in that video, agreed that the strike “seems to” constitute a war crime, though he was wily enough not to repeat the words “war crime” used by CNN’s Dana Bash.\n\nNow, let’s back up a minute.\n\nOn this day in 1823, President James Monroe established what became known as the Monroe Doctrine — that the United States, not Europe, would be the driving force in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has embraced that policy. For instance, he has homed in on the drug cartels as being responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans over the years, as well as facilitating what he has called an “invasion” of illegal aliens. The cartels traffic drugs and people across our borders, and Trump has escalated the U.S. response from border security and widespread deportations to the military level — 11 warships and 15,000 troops are now in the Caribbean. The administration has taken out at least 23 drug boats since September, killing more than 80.\n\nThe administration is also posturing toward regime change in Venezuela. Illegitimate strongman President Nicolás Maduro, the Trump administration argues, effectively runs foreign terrorist organizations like TdA (Tren de Aragua), Sinaloa, and Cartel de los Soles (Cartel of the Suns). Team Trump says those FTOs represent a real threat to U.S. national security, justifying a military response.\n\nNow, back to the kill order. \n\nTo be fair, The Washington Post did extensively report various angles, such as this nugget in the 25th paragraph: Joint Special Operations Command, or JSOC, explained that “the ‘double-tap,’ or follow-on strike, was intended to sink the boat and remove a navigation hazard to other vessels — not to kill survivors.” But as intended, the Post’s “kill them all” headline got all of the attention.\n\n“Mark my words,” warned Massachusetts Democrat Representative Seth Moulton, “It may take some time, but Americans will be prosecuted for this, either as a war crime or outright murder.” Translation: If Democrats win in 2026, stay tuned for Impeachment 3.0.\n\nHegseth responded to the Post’s report, “As usual, the fake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland. As we’ve said from the beginning, and in every statement, these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be ‘lethal, kinetic strikes.’ The declared intent is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats, and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people. Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization.”\n\nAsked about the story, Trump initially responded on Sunday, “We’ll look into it, but no, I wouldn’t have wanted that — a second strike.” Trump, the White House, and the Pentagon have all said Hegseth did not specifically order the second strike to kill those two survivors, only the initial lethal strike. Admiral Frank M. “Mitch” Bradley was the Special Operations commander overseeing the attack, and Hegseth called him “an American hero” who “has my 100% support.” Still, Hegseth’s defense — basically that “it was always our intention to kill them” — doesn’t really suffice.\n\nShooting the wounded is what the Japanese did to American sailors in World War II, and that was during an actual declared war. Killing combatants who are hors de combat (i.e., no longer in the fight) runs afoul of the U.S. Law of War Manual, as well as the Geneva Conventions. If that is what happened, there are accountability questions.\n\nRepresentatives Mike Rogers (R-AL), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and Adam Smith (D-WA), the panel’s ranking Democrat, agree. “We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question,” the pair said in a statement.\n\nFurthermore, though the administration has (sort of) laid out its strategy with Venezuela and the cartels, the legality of the whole enterprise is debatable. Essentially, it boils down to this: Congress has specifically defined both terrorist activity and drug trafficking, and there’s no significant intersection in those definitions. Though the administration certainly claims the authority to conduct such strikes, Congress has never chosen Trump’s combined “narco-terrorist” definition.\n\nAs for the strikes, two comparisons come to mind. Barack Obama conducted numerous drone strikes overseas, some of which killed four American citizens. Team Obama essentially said “Oops” and moved on. More than a decade later, in retaliation for 13 Americans killed during Joe Biden’s disgraceful surrender and retreat from Afghanistan, he ordered a diversionary drone strike that killed a longtime U.S. aid worker and nine Afghan civilians, seven of whom were children. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley called it “a righteous strike.”\n\nI’m not making a “well, they did it first” argument. I’m saying that, as with many other issues in Trump’s second term, the president is arguably following bad precedents set by his predecessors, and that is not the ideal way to govern. Maybe, as Trump’s most arduous supporters would say, I just need to remember “what time it is.” In other words, things are so bad that Trump has no choice but to govern by pushing the bounds of power in whatever direction he deems necessary.\n\nTrump definitely deserves a bit of latitude in his governance, but as we approach the 250th anniversary of our Declaration of Independence, we should be looking to its principles as intently as ever. That is the source of my concern, regardless of which party is in the White House.\n\nFollow Nate Jackson on X.\n\nComment | Share\n\nMORE ANALYSIS\n\nEmmy Griffin: Third World Immigration and Somalia — As part of a broader effort to undo the damage done by Joe Biden, Donald Trump is addressing legal immigration granted to America-hating immigrants.\nDouglas Andrews: Wajahat Warns Whitey — A bomb-throwing racist podcaster let loose with a string of insults directed toward white European Americans and their culture, but was anybody listening?\nJack DeVine: Midterm Elections, Dead Ahead! — Get ready, American voters — NOW is the time to make sure that next November’s elections don’t unravel a year of major achievements.\nMichael Smith: The Republic at 250: A Crisis of Civic Memory — America’s fading understanding of constitutional liberty is opening the door to rival ideologies eager to fill the void.\nGary Bauer: The Walz Standard for Corruption — More than 400 Minnesota public employees warned about the corruption in the Somali community.

        "text": "Washington — Voters are heading to the polls Tuesday in central Tennessee for 2025's final election showdown in a race that could be a referendum on President Trump. Republican nominee Matt Van Epps, a combat veteran, and Democrat Aftyn Behn, a Tennessee state representative, are vying for the seat in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District to replace former GOP Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July. Green had represented the district, which stretches from parts of Nashville to the state's borders with Kentucky and Alabama and includes many rural counties, since 2019. He won his most recent race by more than 20 points. Though the election would normally be considered a safe win for Republicans, polling has shown a closer-than-expected race in The Volunteer State, including some that outline a single-digit race. Meanwhile, millions of dollars in outside spending have poured in, while top figures in both parties have stumped for the candidates in recent days. Still, a Democratic victory in the deep-red Tennessee district would be an uphill climb. But onlookers will be watching to see whether the race comes within a single-digit margin as a possible harbinger of what's to come in next year's elections. An indicator for the midtermsThe outcome of Tuesday's special election will all but certainly be viewed as an indicator for what's to come in next year's midterm elections, as Democrats tout a string of recent victories. Traditional political wisdom dictates that the party that controls the White House often loses ground in midterm elections. And the Tennessee special election follows overperformance by Democrats in special elections in September, along with a sweep across key races in November's elections that the party has pointed to as evidence of a changing tide among the electorate after bruising 2024 elections for the party. In last month's races, Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill handily won their gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, while in New York City, democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani prevailed in his race for mayor. With the dynamics in Tennessee, even a narrow loss in Tuesday's special election would be viewed as bolstering Democrats' momentum heading into the midterms.A special election with national attentionTuesday's special election has drawn national interest, with millions of dollars in outside spending, along with visits and phone rallies held by high-ranking members of both parties, who have poured into the district in recent days to support the candidates.House Speaker Mike Johnson stumped for Van Epps in the district Monday, framing the race as a contrast between the GOP \"delivering on our promises,\" and Democrats imposing their \"radical\" agenda. At one point, Johnson phoned a \"friend,\" who turned out to be the president. \"We have to win this seat,\" Mr. Trump told the crowd. \"Let's make it a sweeping victory. The whole world is watching Tennessee right now and they're watching your district,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's a big vote, it's got to show something, and it's got to show that the Republican party is stronger than it's ever been.\"Former Vice President Al Gore, who represented Tennessee in Congress, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were among Democrats who spoke at a phone rally for Behn on Monday. Gore said during November's elections, \"bipartisan and independent voters served notice, with massive landslides, that they're sick and tired of Trump's madness and cruelty.\"\"So it's no wonder that the president's begun to panic about tomorrow's election here in Tennessee,\" Gore said. \"The stage is set, and I do believe that Tennesseans are determined to claw back decency, self respect and common sense from the most corrupt and dangerous president in American history.\"",

        "text": "Welcome to Sesame Street. The word of the day is “affordability.”\n\nDemocrats have treated it as a magic spell ever since their 2024 collapse drove the party’s approval to historic lows. New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and governors-elect Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey ran very different races, yet all credited their wins to a relentless focus on the cost of living. Mamdani in particular used the term like an incantation to bury a record full of extremist statements and friendly nods toward terrorist movements.\n\nTurning ‘affordability’ into a political idol guarantees policies that cannibalize the future.\n\nDemocrats also see the “affordability” push as an opportunity to turn Republicans’ most effective weapon against them. Joe Biden’s low approval ratings on the economy dogged him throughout his entire term, and his constant insistence that things were improving did not cut the (suddenly expensive) mustard. \n\nRepublican anxiety grows\n\nOn his first day back in office, Donald Trump ordered “all executive departments and agencies to deliver emergency price relief.” But Democrats’ stronger-than-expected showing in the 2025 elections has GOP strategists wondering whether that relief is moving too slowly to blunt the message.\n\nTrump, who dominated the 2024 campaign by hammering prices, sounds irritated that his best issue has turned into a liability. He avoids the word “affordability,” though it has begun sneaking into his teleprompter.\n\n“We’re making incredible strides to Make America Affordable Again,” he told the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum. “Democrats had the worst inflation in history. They had the highest prices in history. The country was going to hell. ... We’re bringing prices down.”\n\nA political arms race\n\nBoth parties now talk about the cost of living as their top priority, and struggling families need the attention. But a politics built around “affordability” can easily turn into a race to the bottom — an auction of quick fixes that burn next year’s seed corn for a bump in the polls.\n\nPlenty of shortcuts tempt politicians. Mamdani floated the most obvious one: freezing rents across one million rent-stabilized apartments in New York City. If he pulls it off — a big “if” — tenants will enjoy short-term relief. Yet the move will also choke new construction and allow existing homes to deteriorate as landlords lose the revenue needed to maintain them.\n\nBeware of quick fixes\n\nEven Republicans flirt with shortcuts. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) teamed up on a bill capping credit-card interest rates at 10%. Cheaper interest sounds great until you follow the consequences. A hard cap would force lenders to reject more applications, denying low-income Americans the credit they often need to escape poverty or cover emergencies.\n\nRepublicans face their own affordability temptation as well. AI data centers, which consume enormous amounts of power, are driving up electric bills faster than increased energy production can offset. Slowing or freezing data-center construction could save households money for a year or two. It would also cripple America’s position in the AI race with China and cost the country trillions of dollars in long-term economic growth.\n\nRELATED: If conservatives will not defend capitalism, who will?\n\n Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nTariffs under fire\n\nTrump’s tariffs have become a favorite target for Democrats claiming to champion affordability. The administration recently eased tariffs on food imports such as bananas and coffee. But gutting the entire tariff regime — if the Supreme Court allows it to remain in place — would be a profound mistake.\n\nTariffs have pushed some prices upward, but the Harvard Business School tariff tracker estimates that only 20% of tariff costs reach consumers. Foreign companies and foreign governments absorb the rest.\n\nMeanwhile, tariff revenue strengthens the government’s financial footing, and trillions of dollars in investment continue to flow into new and expanded U.S. manufacturing. Reverting to the failed neoliberal free-trade dogma in the name of “affordability” might give politicians a quick approval boost. It would gut the industrial base, weaken the budget, and destroy the very blue-collar jobs voters were promised.\n\nOur marshmallow test\n\nBlaming the other party for rising prices works because it taps into real pain. But it also encourages the kind of policymaking you would expect from the child in the famous experiment who couldn’t wait 15 minutes for a second marshmallow. He ate the first one instantly and lost the reward.\n\nThe cost of living in America (to say nothing of thriving) is far too high. Families need real relief. But turning “affordability” into a political idol guarantees policies that cannibalize the future. Prosperity demands discipline. A country that chases quick fixes will never escape its long-term economic traps.",

        "text": "Just in the jails of New York City alone, there are over 7,000 criminal illegal aliens. The number of criminal foreigners in New York is certainly much higher, and yet Democrats there are angry at federal officers for arresting illegals.\n\nThe sheer number of dangerous criminal illegal aliens in our country is staggering, and of course we really don’t know exact numbers. The Democrats saw to that. They are determined more than ever to conceal the true impact of mass illegal migration and pro-crime policies that release criminals over and over.\n\nHundreds of leftist protesters hurled objects at ICE agents in New York Saturday, even using trash cans as weapons. The dangerous violence resulted in multiple arrests, according to Fox News. Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin went on Fox News to discuss the violence and expose just what sort of illegal migration crisis ICE is trying to address in New York City.\n\nRelated: White House Debunks Critiques With Immigration Law\n\n“We're seeing that these criminal illegal aliens are exiting the jails and going back onto New York or Chicago or these other sanctuary streets to reperpetuate their crimes,” McLaughlin emphasized. “Today in New York City's jails are 7,169 criminal illegal aliens. We're talking about hundreds of murderers, hundreds of sexual predators, drug traffickers, the worst of the worst.”\n\n🚨 BREAKING: It was just confirmed that New York City is harboring 7,169 known criminal illegal aliens, including HUNDREDS of m*rderers and s*xual predators\"HAND OVER THOSE INDIVIDUALS!\"\"Honor those detainers! Then we won't have to flood the zone with ICE law… pic.twitter.com/rTw8gYUu87— Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) December 1, 2025\n\nAnd yet Democrats favor criminal scum over the officers just trying to bring peace and lawful order to the city.\n\nMcLaughlin called out one politician in particular: “Dan Goldman and these other sanctuary city politicians, they should agree to hand over those individuals, honor those detainers, and then we won't have to flood the zone with our ICE law enforcement, we won't have to put those men and women on the ground because we will get these vicious criminals out of New York City's jails.” Which one would think would be a desirable goal for any sane person. Then again, Democrats are not sane.\n\nRelated: Bessent Moves to Completely Cut Off Illegals From U.S. Financial System\n\nMcLaughlin was referring to Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.), of Trump impeachment infamy, who lied about the reason for the violent anti-ICE riots in NYC this weekend by claiming: “ICE is continuing to engage in reckless and unwarranted militarized operations. Today’s confrontation didn't protect a single person but instead unnecessarily put New Yorkers, federal agents, and NYPD officers in harm’s way. Make no mistake: any chaos and violence in NYC involving ICE is instigated by ICE.”\n\nThere are thousands of illegal alien criminals already in jail and many thousands more not in jail, and Goldman is saying the ICE operations are unwarranted. This is why assaults on ICE officers are up 1,153%.\n\n🚨 BREAKING: Anti-ICE rioters in NYC are now DESTROYING property to create barriers blocking ICE from driving through NYCHow is this NOT an insurrection?ICE is having to fight to even leave their facility — let alone DEPORT illegals pic.twitter.com/GCEV02xjs0— Nick Sortor (@nicksortor) November 29, 2025\n\nNew York Mayor-Elect and socialist antisemite Zohran Mamdani has already said he will not cooperate with ICE in any way once he takes office. This would be a shift from current Mayor Eric Adams’s policy. It will also ensure more violence and crime.\n\nNote: It's the holiday season, which means PJ Media VIP's Black Friday sale is back!\n\nNow through Monday evening, 11:59 PM ET, receive 60% OFF an annual VIP, VIP Gold, or VIP Platinum membership with promo code FIGHT.",

        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks will pay about $35 million to more than 15,000 New York City workers to settle claims it denied them stable schedules and arbitrarily cut their hours, city officials announced Monday, hours before Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders visited striking baristas on a picket line.\n\nThe development came amid a continuing strike by Starbucks’ union that began last month at dozens of locations around the country.\n\nThe workers want better hours and increased staffing, and they are angry that Starbucks hasn’t agreed on a contract nearly four years after workers voted to unionize at a Buffalo store. Union votes at other locations followed, and about 550 of Starbucks’ 10,000 company-owned stores are now unionized. The coffee giant also has around 7,000 licensed locations at airports, grocery stores and other locales.\n\nWorkers and the company dispute the extent and impact of the strike, but Mamdani, Sanders and some state and city officials sought to amplify the baristas’ message by mingling with scores of strikers and supporters outside a Starbucks shop in Brooklyn.\n\n“These are not demands of greed — these are demands of decency,” Mamdani, a democratic socialist who ran on pledges to aid working-class people, told the crowd. Some workers carried giant mock-ups of Starbucks takeout cups, bearing the union’s logo instead of the coffee chain’s insignia.\n\nFour years after the first shop’s union vote, “Starbucks has refused to sit down and negotiate a fair contract,” said Sanders, a Vermont independent who supported Mamdani’s campaign.\n\nStarbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson said the company was “ready to talk when the union is ready to return to negotiations.” While the union picketed, Starbucks “focused on continuing to offer the best job in retail,” where more than 1 million applicants seek jobs annually, Anderson said in a statement.\n\n“The facts speak for themselves,” she said.\n\nStriking baristas described a harried workplace with chronic short-staffing, online orders so complex that the ticket is sometimes longer than the cup, and last-minute calls to come in.\n\n“It is the company’s issue to give us the labor amount to schedule partners fairly, and they are not scheduling us fairly, no matter how much money we are making them,” said Gabriel Pierre, 26, a shift supervisor at a store in suburban Bellmore.\n\nStarbucks has been trying to bounce back from a period of lagging sales as inflation-conscious U.S. customers questioned whether its coffee concoctions were worth the money. The Seattle-based company recently reported the first increase in nearly two years in same-store sales — a term for sales at locations open at least a year — but restructuring costs, store redesigns and other changes took a bite out of profits in its July-September quarter.\n\nUnder the agreement announced Monday with New York City’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, Starbucks will pay $3.4 million in civil penalties, in addition to the $35 million it is paying workers. The company also agreed to comply with the city’s Fair Workweek law going forward.\n\nThe company said it’s committed to operating responsibly and complying with all applicable local laws and regulations everywhere it does business, but Starbucks also noted the complexities of the city’s law.\n\n“This is notoriously challenging to manage,” Anderson said.\n\nMost of the affected employees who held hourly positions will receive $50 for each week worked from July 2021 through July 2024, the department said. Workers who experienced a violation after that may be eligible for compensation by filing a complaint with the department.\n\n“I sure hope that it gives Starbucks an awakening,” said Kaari Harsila, 21, a Brooklyn store shift supervisor who was picketing Monday.\n\nThe settlement also guarantees that employees laid off during recent store closings in the city will get an opportunity for reinstatement at other Starbucks locations.\n\nThe city began investigating in 2022 after receiving dozens of worker complaints against several Starbucks locations. The investigation eventually expanded to hundreds of stores. The city said the probe found, among other things, that most Starbucks employees never got regular schedules, making it difficult for staffers to plan other commitments, such as child care, education or other jobs.\n\nThe company also denied workers the chance to pick up extra shifts, so they remained part-timers even when they wanted to work more, according to the city.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

        "text": "JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) — Former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey’s bid for a political comeback comes down to a one-on-one runoff Tuesday against an opponent who has denounced him and his scandal-stained exit from the governor’s office two decades ago as the epitome of “politics of the past.”\n\nMcGreevey and James Solomon are the last candidates standing in a race for mayor of Jersey City, a community across the Hudson River from Manhattan that is sometimes referred to as New York City’s sixth borough. Like last month’s elections in New York and elsewhere, the race has focused heavily on affordability, particularly the high cost of housing.\n\nThe contest advanced to a runoff after no candidate tallied more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 4 general election, when seven people were on the ballot. Solomon, a city council member since 2017, finished first. McGreevey placed second. Both are Democrats, though the race is nonpartisan. Polls close at 8 p.m.\n\nMcGreevey is running for public office for the first time since he resigned as governor in 2004 — a stunning announcement remembered mostly for the spectacle of him declaring: “I am a gay American.” His exit was driven in part by controversy over his decision to hire a man he said was his lover, ex-Israeli naval officer Golan Cipel, as the state’s homeland security adviser in 2002 despite Cipel’s lack of qualifications.\n\nHe launched his mayoral campaign in 2023 with a social media video titled: “Second chances are central to who I am.”\n\n“I want Jersey City to be Jersey City,” McGreevey said in a recent interview. “That is: an iconic city in the Garden State reflecting the hopes and the aspirations of families.”\n\nMcGreevey, 68, has pledged to be a one-term mayor, calling it “a great closing act” on his career. He has touted his experience as an elected leader — both as governor and before that as mayor of suburban Woodbridge Township — and said he’d back Solomon for mayor in four years.\n\nSolomon, 41, said McGreevey’s background is “experience we don’t want.”\n\n“There were just scandal after scandal after scandal,” Solomon said in a recent interview. “That, to me, is disqualifying.”\n\nThe race to run New Jersey’s second-largest city has centered on the cost of living, echoing national concerns. New downtown development catering to affluent New York City commuters is driving overall prices higher, and the city is struggling with a budget shortfall that threatens to hike property taxes. New York City’s mayor-elect, democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, won last month on an affordability platform over another ex-governor looking to make a comeback, Andrew Cuomo.\n\nJersey City is a swath of high-rises and immigrant neighborhoods with about 303,000 residents and a municipal budget of about $700 million. The current mayor, Steven Fulop, declined to seek a fourth term.\n\nMcGreevey has spent about $2.5 million on his campaign. Solomon has spent about $1.3 million.\n\nBoth candidates have vowed to stand up to President Donald Trump, whose administration is suing to end Jersey City’s so-called sanctuary city protections for immigrants.\n\n“If Donald Trump chooses a fight, we’re not going to back down,” Solomon said.\n\nMcGreevey was born in Jersey City and returned to live there in 2015. It’s where his grandfather sought a new life after being forced out of Northern Ireland and where he’s made a new life for himself.\n\nAfter a divorce, McGreevey attended an Episcopal seminary, earned a Master of Divinity degree, volunteered at a Harlem ministry and took steps to become a priest. He later moved into nonprofit work.\n\nHe’s currently executive director of the Jersey City-based New Jersey Reentry Corporation, a non-profit that helps formerly incarcerated people and returning veterans find work and housing.\n\nSolomon grew up in nearby Millburn, has a master’s degree from Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and was an aide to former Boston Mayor Thomas Menino.\n\nHe moved to Jersey City in 2013, is married and he and his wife have three daughters. In 2015, he was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. Now in full remission, he said that challenge inspired him to run for public office.\n\n“I had one of these life is short moments,” Solomon said. “I was like, ‘you know, I think I can do something. I can give back to Jersey City, because Jersey City really had my back during my toughest time.’”\n\nSolomon has vowed to take on developers and special interests, invest in public safety and work with the independent board of education to improve the city’s schools. He said he plans to build on legislation he passed as a council member, including banning rent-hiking algorithms and ensuring tenants have a right to legal counsel.\n\nAlong with affordability, McGreevey said, his immediate concern is an estimated $150 million budget hole that could hike property taxes 30% if not fixed.\n\nHe said he’ll devote his term to making sure “we’re on a road of fiscal sanity and to make sure that Jersey City’s working families aren’t driven out by the downtown crowd.”\n\nBy MICHAEL R.

        "text": "Former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey’s bid for a political comeback as Jersey City’s next mayor will be decided by city voters Tuesday.\n\nMcGreevey is facing Jersey City Councilman James Solomon in a runoff election after finishing second to Solomon in a seven-candidate race Nov. 4.\n\nHe is trying to avoid the fate of former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran for mayor of New York City but was defeated four weeks ago by Zohran Mamdani.\n\nThough McGreevey, 68, had higher name recognition stemming from his time as governor two decades ago and raised $5 million, around twice as much as Solomon, the two-term councilman was first with 29% of the vote, ahead of McGreevey with 25%.\n\nJersey City holds runoff elections when the first-place finisher in a general election fails to surpass 50%.\n\nDays after his first-place finish, Solomon picked up endorsements from U.S. Sen. Andy Kim, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and three of the original mayoral candidates who, when combined, received 41% on Nov. 4. U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., announced her support for Solomon on Monday. \n\nSolomon, 41, may be benefitting from the same political trends that boosted Mamdani and other candidates in New York and Virginia four weeks ago, Seton Hall University associate professor of political science Matthew Hale told NJ Advance Media.\n\n“People are hungry for change. People want something that’s different. That’s what we’re seeing,” said Hale, who does not live in Jersey City.\n\nMcGreevey stepped down as governor in 2004, in the third year of his first term, after announcing he is “a gay American” and admitting to having an adulterous affair with a man he put on the state payroll as a Homeland Security adviser.\n\nHe slowly rebuilt and reshaped his public profile, drawing bipartisan praise for assisting those recovering from addiction and transitioning from incarceration. \n\nHe was the first of the original seven mayoral candidates to enter the race, more than two years ago. The video that accompanied his campaign announcement was entitled, “Second Chances.\"\n\nHowever, during their fifth and final debate last Tuesday on PIX11, Solomon said the city needs a fresh start.\n\n“We need change. We need to move forward, not move to the past,” Solomon said.\n\nThough he remains best-known for his time as governor, McGreevey said Monday he is focused solely on Jersey City.\n\n“I’m not running for my next office. I’m running for this one, for Jersey City,” McGreevey said.\n\nThe winner will succeed Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, who did not seek a fourth term and lost in the Democratic primary for governor. Both candidates are Democrats, though political parties play no formal role in Jersey City elections.\n\nPolls will be open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nIt is rare for a former governor to attempt a comeback as a mayor. In California, Jerry Brown became mayor of Oakland in 1999 — 16 years after finishing two terms as governor and 11 years before winning a third term as governor.\n\nMcGreevey, though, is the third former northeastern governor on a mayoral ballot in the past year. In Delaware, Wilmington Mayor John Carney was elected in November 2024 with less than three months remaining in his second term as governor. Delaware, like New Jersey, prohibits governors from seeking a third term.\n\nIn Jersey City, McGreevey and Solomon have emphasized affordability, a key issue in Mamdani’s victory in New York City, in offering plans to address rising costs in New Jersey’s second-largest city.\n\nSolomon said in last week’s debate he would push for the development of additional housing units with monthly rents of $1,000 or lower — considerably under the average cost in Jersey City — a plan that McGreevey said is not realistic.\n\nWhen asked about property taxes, McGreevey said they would remain unchanged by the end of his first term. Solomon said they would be stabilized at the rate of inflation, between two to three percent.\n\nMcGreevey was born in Jersey City but grew up in Carteret. He received a law degree from Georgetown University in 1981, worked as a prosecutor and won a New Jersey Assembly seat in Middlesex County in 1990. He became mayor of Woodbridge in 1992 and was elected to a four-year term in 1995, the same year he was elected to the state Senate.\n\nMcGreevey was elected governor in 2001, defeating the Republican nominee — former Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler — with 56% of the vote.\n\nHe is the executive director of the New Jersey Reentry Corporation, a nonprofit group that helps people leaving prison or addiction centers.\n\n“He really has rehabilitated himself in many respects,” Hale said, adding, “Coming back from a scandal has never been an easy thing to do.” \n\nSolomon has been a Jersey City council member since 2017. He represents Ward E, which has the largest population of the city’s six wards and includes the downtown waterfront area.\n\nSolomon grew up in Millburn. He received an undergraduate degree from Pomona College in California and a master’s degree in public policy from Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government before moving to Jersey City in 2013.\n\nSolomon has taught government and politics at New Jersey City University and Hudson County Community College.\n\nIn endorsing Solomon four days after the election, Kim said he “represents a new generation of leadership.”\n\n“For too long, politics in New Jersey has been an exclusive club. Now is the time to change that,” said Kim, elected last year after challenging New Jersey First Lady Tammy Murphy, who dropped out before the Democratic primary vote.\n\nMcGreevey and Solomon will be awaiting the results Tuesday night at separate locations less than two miles apart in Jersey City, the state’s second-largest city with around 300,000 residents.\n\nA second Hudson County city also is holding a runoff election for mayor Tuesday. Hoboken voters will decide between council members Emily Jabbour and Michael Russo, who finished first and second, respectively, among six candidates on Nov. 4.\n\nThe two runoffs elections include three city council seats in Hoboken and seven in Jersey City.",

        "text": "The U.S. housing market is expected to undergo a “great reset” next year, according to predictions from real estate brokerage Redfin, as significant improvements in affordability will push sales up all across the country. \n\nIt won’t be a quick fix: Redfin warns that it will be “a long, slow recovery” for the housing market, but a much-needed one after years of rising home prices, stubbornly high borrowing costs, and higher property taxes and homeowner insurance premiums.\n\nIt won’t be enough to make homebuying affordable in the short run for younger generations, either, the real estate brokerage said. But it will be enough to get the U.S. housing market out of its frozen state, leading to a slow but steady increase in sales.\n\nSome markets, however, will be much “hotter” than others, Redfin said—including the New York City suburbs, the Midwest and the Great Lakes regions.\n\nA map showing what Redfin expects to be the “hottest markets” in the country next year. (Newsweek)\n\nWhich Areas Will Be Most Attractive to Buyers? Why?\n\nAffordability and convenience will drive homebuying activity in the nation’s hottest markets next year, according to Redfin.\n\nAreas around the Big Apple, which will have the newly elected Mayor Zohran Mamdani at its helm, will attract people who need to commute to their offices in New York City at lower costs than in the busy metropolis.\n\nThe Midwest and Great Lakes regions will be “hot” markets because they are relatively affordable compared to other parts of the country. Crucially, these areas represent “relatively safe havens,” Redfin said, against natural disasters like wildfires and floods, which have contributed to bringing up homeowner insurance premiums in much of the country over the past five years.\n\nSmall and mid-sized cities in the Midwest and the Great Lakes regions will be “luring recent graduates,” Redfin wrote, “with affordable rents and opportunities to build a stable career in a blue-collar field, as AI replaces some entry-level white-collar jobs.”\n\nWhich Areas Are Going to Cool Down? \n\nPandemic boomtowns like Austin, Texas, and Nashville, Tennessee, which became particularly overheated between 2020 and 2022, won’t be hot markets next year, according to Redfin.\n\nIn fact, some of the hottest markets during the pandemic—coastal Florida and Texas—will see homes for sale “languish,” according to Redfin, “due partly to natural disasters and surging insurance costs and partly to pandemic-era remote workers moving back to where their office is located.”\n\nThe two Southern states experienced a huge influx of newcomers during the pandemic, as the rise of remote work allowed many Americans to relocate across the country. A construction boom followed, as developers in the two states tried to keep up with surging demand. \n\nBut the end of the health emergency, return-to-office orders from employers and—most importantly—much higher housing costs put a damper on domestic migration to both states, and many newcomers have since moved back to their home states.\n\nThe result is that demand has dwindled in Florida and Texas over the past few months, while inventory has surged, putting downward pressure on prices. “People who need to sell” in these states, Redfin wrote in its report, “may be forced to take a loss.”",

        "text": "Just observe the last month. First, California Gov. Gavin Newsom was riding high after passage of Proposition 50 and its changes in California congressional district lines made him the most successful national Democrat in countering a key initiative by President Trump.\n\nBarely a week later, Newsom’s former chief of staff was indicted on charges of political corruption and tax fraud and many began to write him off as a presidential candidate because of it.\n\nNot even a week after that, Newsom was back in the catbird seat after a federal appeals court in Texas threw out that state’s gerrymandered congressional district plan – which earlier provided the motive for the Newsom-sponsored Prop. 50. The U.S. Supreme Court days later temporarily reinstated the gerrymandered Texas lines.\n\nIt now appears the Texas decision nixing the changes there may be reversed by the high court, even though it was written by a Trump-appointed judge. Meanwhile the California proposition figures to survive its own court challenges, filed by the state Republican Party and the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nThat’s because Texas officials from Gov. Greg Abbott down were open about their effort to concentrate Houston-area blacks into one district while giving five others to white Republicans. By contrast, there was little or no mention of race by either side in the Prop. 50 campaign, which was very explicitly motivated by pure politics.\n\nNewsom created Prop. 50 specifically to counter the Texas gerrymander, which unlike California’s changes in district lines, was not adopted by a vote of the people. No race issue ever arose here until Republicans claimed after Prop. 50’s resounding win that was what motivated it.\n\nNothing says the U.S. Supreme Court has to give a final OK to either the Texas court decision or Prop. 50, but if it eventually tosses both gerrymanders, Newsom would still achieve his political goal of offsetting the Texas changes put in motion by a phone call from Trump to Abbott. If both efforts are eventually nixed, Newsom’s goal of regaining the prior balance after the Texas action would still have been reached.\n\nSaid one election law professor the day of the Texas decision, “There are not many grounds for a legal challenge against Prop. 50 to succeed.”\n\nThere remains a possibility that both Prop. 50 and the Texas court decision tossing that state’s gerrymander will stand up in the Supreme Court. If that happens, Newsom would have achieved far more than his goal of balancing the Texas gerrymander with an exchange of five new California Democratic seats for five new Texas GOP ones. In that case, Newsom would have given Democrats a net gain of five seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nIf something like that couldn’t put Newsom in an early lead in the 2028 Democratic presidential sweepstakes, it’s hard to see what could. A net gain of five seats would likely give Democrats control of the House, where almost all new Trump initiatives might then die.\n\nNo wonder Newsom gloating after the Texas court decision came down. In a post on X, he said, “Donald Trump and Greg Abbott played with fire, got burned, and democracy won.” For a moment.\n\nEven if Newsom proves correct, though, and the high court eventually says it’s OK to gerrymander at midterm for political reasons, but not racial ones, he will still be a long way from winning the next Democratic nomination. For Newsom took a turn toward the center in his bill signings this fall, favoring business in many of his decisions.\n\nHis fall efforts were clearly designed to stamp him as a moderate, but also an environmentalist with a tight financial fist. This could leave him open to a challenge from the left by someone like New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has built a career around leading her party’s far-left wing.\n\nThat possibility gained credence from the New York mayoral win of Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani and the subsequent upset win by fellow Democratic Socialist Katie Wilson and a slate of similarly-oriented candidates in Seattle. The bottom line: Newsom may be riding high today, but in a season of very speedy change, no one can know how long that will last.\n\nEmail Thomas Elias at tdelias@aol.com, and read more of his columns online at californiafocus.net.",

During the podcast, Mamdani did not say whether he supported Schumer stepping down or being replaced. \"I think it's time for me to focus on this transition and to start delivering for New Yorkers from day one,\" Mamdani said before discussing the government shutdown. \"I think I've been clear. I think it was a very bad deal.

        "text": "FRANKLIN, TN - Republican National Committee (RNC) Chair Joe Gruters says that the Democrats' momentum following their sweeping victories in last month's 2025 ballot box showdowns will come to an end in Tuesday's special election for a hotly contested GOP-controlled vacant House seat in a ruby red Tennessee congressional district. \"Tennessee is the red wall. So they’re not getting past Tennessee. We’re going to win this race. This is our territory,\" the RNC chair told Fox News Digital after speaking at a rally for Matt Van Epps, the GOP congressional nominee in a must-win race for Republicans. Van Epps is facing off against Democratic nominee Aftyn Behn in the race to succeed former GOP Rep. Mark Green, who resigned from office in June to take a private sector job. TOP SURROGATES HIT CAMPAIGN TRAIL ON EVE OF CRUCIAL CONGRESSIONAL SHOWDOWN President Donald Trump carried the 7th Congressional District — which is located in central and western Tennessee, stretches from Kentucky to Alabama, and includes parts of Nashville — by 22 points in last year's presidential election. And Green won the district by over 20 points in his 2022 and 2024 re-elections. But Democrats are energized following the 2025 elections, and polls suggest a close contest between Van Epps and Behn in a race that's seen as a key barometer ahead of next year's midterm elections, when the GOP will be defending its razor-thin House majority. WATCH: WHAT AFTYN BEHN TOLD FOX NEWS DIGITAL ON ELECTION EVE Pointing to New York City, New Jersey and Virginia, where the Democrats scored high-profile victories last month, Gruters said they are \"a lot different than Nashville, Tennessee and these communities out here.\" \"From a registration perspective and from a party perspective, this is our home turf.... We’ll get right back on track to the 2026 midterms with a victory,\" Gruters predicted. Outside groups aligned with both parties have shelled out millions of dollars to run ads in the race and pour resources onto the campaign trail. And on Election Eve, Gruters and House Speaker Mike Johnson joined Van Epps at a series of campaign stops. \"We're going to win this seat, but we cannot take anything for granted,\" Johnson said in an interview with Fox News Digital. DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, GO ALL IN ON FINAL 2025 CONGRESSIONAL BALLOT BOX SHOWDOWN \"Special elections are strange because a lot of people take for granted in a deep red district like this that the Republican is just going to win automatically. Nothing's automatic. So we're here to help turn out the vote and make sure we get this great candidate right over that line,\" Johnson said. Aiming to motivate low-propensity Trump supporters, who often don't vote when the president's not on the ballot, Johnson emphasized that \"we take no vote for granted. We need everybody to turn out.\" Before introducing Van Epps at Monday's first rally, Johnson called Trump on his cell phone and the president spoke to the crowd for over four minutes. \"Let's make it a sweeping victory,\" Trump said. \"The whole world is watching Tennessee right now. And they're watching your district. The whole world. It’s a big vote. It’s going to show something. It's got to show that the Republican Party is stronger than it's ever been.\" Trump joined Van Epps later in the day for an evening tele rally. In another sign of the importance of holding the seat, Republican Gov. Bill Lee, GOP Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, as well as Republican members of Congress from Tennessee, state GOP lawmakers and rival candidates who lost to Van Epps in last month's primary, showed up in support. Van Epps, a military combat veteran and former commissioner of the Tennessee Department of General Services who was backed by Trump in the primary, told Fox News Digital that \"we're going to win decisively.\" The RNC spent nearly half a million dollars to support Van Epps. The national party committee deployed full-time RNC field staff to the district and launched get out the vote and persuasive mail efforts in partnership with the Tennessee GOP. The rival Democratic National Committee (DNC) also poured plenty of resources into the race. And DNC Chair Ken Martin campaigned with Behn late last month. \"If a Trump +22 seat is where Republicans are drawing the line and making their final stand, they should get ready to be in the minority after the midterms next year,\" DNC deputy communications director Abhi Rahman told Fox News Digital. MUSIC CITY MIRACLE: A LOOK AT AN UNUSUALLY CONTENTIOUS ELECTION IN THE VOLUNTEER STATE Behn, a state representative, former healthcare community organizer, told supporters at a canvassing launch event on Monday that \"this race is a lot closer than they [Republicans] ever expected.\" And Behn, speaking with Fox News Digital, argued that \"we've been building, we've been organizing, they've [Republicans] been scapegoating.\" And Behn also enjoyed support from high-profile surrogates on Election Eve. Progressive champion Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York headlined a virtual rally on Monday evening for Behn, a rising progressive star who some have dubbed the \"AOC of Tennessee.\" Ocasio-Cortez was joined by Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state, who chaired the Congressional Progressive Caucus the past four years, Black Voters Matter Fund co-founder LaTosha Brown and former Vice President Al Gore, a Tennessee native. Behn has faced repeated attacks that she's out of step with voters in the district. \"She does not represent the values of Tennessee or of America. She is as far left as you can get. She's a radical,\" Van Epps claimed in his Fox News Digital interview. \"We have to reject that ideology. And we're going to do that tomorrow.\" Johnson argued at the Franklin rally that Behn was a \"radical\" and \"a dangerous far leftist. And she will be a rubber stamp for Hakeem Jeffries and AOC and all the radicals in Congress.\" And Trump, repeating comments he made over the weekend on social media, charged that Behn \"hates Christianity\" and \"hates country music.\" Trump was referring to past comments Behn made from a 2020 podcast. \"I hate the city, I hate the bachelorettes, I hate the pedal taverns, I hate country music, I hate all of the things that make Nashville apparently an 'it' city to the rest of the country. But I hate it,\" she said in the podcast. TENNESSEE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE CAUGHT SAYING 'I HATE NASHVILLE' AND 'COUNTRY MUSIC' IN RESURFACED CLIP The district is solidly red, but includes parts of the Democratic stronghold of Nashville, Tennessee's capital and its most populous city, and a major national center for the country music industry. The district encompasses parts of north and west Nashville, including the downtown area which has long been a very popular tourist destination. Behn, in a CNN interview on Sunday, noted that she was a \"private citizen\" when she made the comments. \"Nashville is my home. Do I roll my eyes at the bachelorette parties and the pedal taverns that are blocking my access to my house? Yeah. Every Nashvillian does. But this race has always been about something bigger. It's about families across middle Tennessee that are getting crushed by rising prices.\" Republicans are also taking aim at Behn over an op-ed titled, \"Tennessee is a racist state, and so is its legislature,\" that appeared in a 2019 edition of The Tennessean newspaper. The RNC, pointing in a recent social media post to the six-year-old opinion piece, asked, \"If Behn hates Tennessee so much, why is she trying to represent it?\" Also resurfacing in recent weeks are anti-police comments Behn made on a now-deleted social media account. \"Clearly, I'm living rent-free in President Trump's mind,\" Behn told supporters on Monday. And asked by Fox News Digital about the incoming verbal fire from Republicans, Behn joked, \"I always love to hear from my fans.\" She touted that \"I have a track record of showing up in the hard fights and small fights in between, not only as an organizer and as an activist, but as a legislator.\" And sticking to her key issue of tackling the high cost of living, Behn said she's \"running on a very simple message of addressing the affordability crisis that Tennesseans are facing, and they [Republicans] don't have a remedy for it.\" Should Behn pull off an upset and win, the GOP House majority would become so fragile the Democrats could have a shot of taking back the chamber next year ahead of the midterms if one or two more Republicans leave Congress early. Republicans were rattled last month when MAGA rock star and top Trump ally Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene announced she would step down in January following a falling out with the president. \"Since I became speaker, I presided over some of the smallest majorities in history. Every seat counts,\" Johnson told Fox News Digital. The showdown in Tennessee isn't the only ballot box showdown capturing national attention on Tuesday. In New Jersey, a disgraced former Democratic governor is seeking a political comeback, but may be blocked by a younger progressive candidate who's gaining momentum.

        "text": "Whether you like him, his politics or not, most commentators can agree that mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has charisma. \n\nWith his Gen Z wife, artist Rama Duwaji, the pair present a breezy, youthful image that feels to some more like a brand campaign than a political movement. Their loved-up wedding photos—shot on film during New York‘s subway rush hour—has ignited discussion about whether we are seeing a new kind of politician: “aesthetically literate,” culturally fluent, and effortlessly cool.\n\nThe couple have been grouped with other image-forward figures like Jack Schlossberg, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and even 84-year-old Bernie Sanders, whose meme-ified mittens went viral a few years ago. But are we really witnessing the rise of the “aesthetically literate” political figure? Or has a memorable image always been a part of the job? And does any of it actually matter when it comes to their political promise?\n\nThe question has gained attention online, in part, thanks to a post from @fooleryco to the Meta-owned platform, Threads, captioned: “Not to be dramatic but we’re witnessing the dawn of the aesthetically literate politician.” \n\nAlongside 34-year-old Mamdani’s subway wedding photos, the post included an image of Schlossberg, grandson of John F. Kennedy, riding a bicycle mid-motion with two blooming bouquets of pink tulips in hand. The photo, taken from Schlossberg’s Instagram, coincided with his announcement to run for New York’s 12th Congressional District in the 2026 election. \n\nSocial media users quickly began swooning over Schlossberg following the news, despite the fact that the 32-year-old’s political CV is rather bare in part due to his youth, and he does not have so much experience running things.\n\nThe post has been liked more than 32,000 times, drawing a flurry of comments from viewers who shared that they agree with the sentiment. Several brought up other political figures who they feel have got good at looking cool.\n\n“They come across as earnest at a time when a lot of older politicians are viewed as stale, scandal-ridden, or checked out,” Andrellos Mitchell, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney and cultural commentator, told Newsweek. “And of course, promising ‘free stuff’ never hurts with certain voters.” \n\nStill, Mitchell argued: “This isn’t some deep new trend. Politics has always borrowed from acting…And New York has its own thing going on—loud, crowded, dramatic, and convinced that those traits equal authenticity. A lot of what goes viral from New York politicians is just the city’s culture spilling onto the internet.”\n\nHe added that political figures like Mamdani and Schlossberg benefit from being photogenic or playing up a certain look that is typically received well online.\n\nFrom left: New York City Mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani (R) celebrates alongside his wife Rama Duwaji (L) during an election night event at the Brooklyn Paramount Theater in Brooklyn, New York on November 4, 2025; and Jack Schlossberg, grandson of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy, speaks on stage during the second day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center on August 20, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois. \n\nExperts agree that what has changed is not the existence of image politics or being a bit better looking by chance, but the visual grammar used to convey it and how those looks are used.\n\n“What we’re seeing with Mamdani and Schlossberg is the rise of the ‘aesthetically literate’ political figure, someone who understands how imagery, tone, and cultural relevance shape modern political identity,” Michelle Glogovac, host of the podcast My Simplified Life, told Newsweek.\n\nGlogovac credits Duwaji, a 28-year-old illustrator often found contributing to media publications, as “the creative brain behind much of [Mamdani’s] visual identity.” \n\nThat identity, she said, speaks directly to younger millennial and Gen Z voters.\n\n“[They] read visuals the way previous generations read op-eds,” she said. “They pick up on cues: Is this person grounded? Are they self-aware? Are they in touch with the culture? And do they look like someone who’s living life alongside us rather than above us?”\n\nAndrellos agreed: “The younger generations gravitate toward anyone who seems ‘real,’ even if ‘real’ just means loud, dramatic, or visually interesting. But as for downsides, yes, image can eclipse substance.”\n\nThe result is a political aesthetic defined not by polish, primness or authority, but by relatability and cultural fluency. \n\n“A photo of Mamdani and his wife in a subway-wedding photoshoot, or Schlossberg holding flowers on a bike, signals a lived-in humanity,” Glogovac said. “AOC posing for GQ, or Bernie looking cold in mittens, creates a cultural shorthand: ‘This person is part of our world.’\n\n“It’s relatability that is being artfully communicated visually, not staged stoicism or political theater.”",

        "text": "Top O' the Briefing\n\nHappy Tuesday, dear Kruiser Morning Briefing friends. Sheyrdebrüundt was determined to make a go of snapping Polaroids of any corduroy he encountered in the wild. \n\nIn my over four decades of political activism I've obviously been around for the careers of a lot of unsavory Democrats. Teddy Kennedy comes to mind right away. I also lived in California for almost 25 years, and that was an endless parade of lefties who made me feel like I needed a Silkwood shower and the triumphant return of Quaaludes. \n\nNever in all of that time, however, has there been a concentration of thoroughly awful people in Dem Land like there is here in the Year of Our Lord 2025. Concentration. Passel. Horde.\n\nA whole bunch. \n\nIt's becoming quite apparent lately that one of the most execrable of the present-day Democrats is Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. I've only been to Minnesota once, so I'm not sure how the state's journey to the lunatic fringe of leftism happened. Maybe it's the stink from Canada. It's a disturbing cautionary tale, though. \n\nThis is from a post Catherine wrote about the Walz scandal:\n\nThe Trump White House pithily stated the disquieting and disgraceful facts of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s (D) money-laundering scandal.Calling Walz “deeply disturbed,” the White House described the massive fraud scandal involving mostly Somali migrants that cost Minnesota taxpayers a billion dollars — and funded a terror group. Democrats are as corrupt as Hades, and failed vice presidential candidate Walz is one of the slimiest.During the COVID-19 lockdowns and mandates, there was plenty of corruption and fraud involving taxpayer money. But the Somali-Walz scandal takes the cake, as the White House detailed\n\nGosh, it's been a whole day since I wrote about Democrats and COVID fraud. \n\nMatt has more details here, and, as he writes, this scandal could bring everything crashing down on Walz. It certainly doesn't look great for him at the moment. This is from my Townhall colleague Dmitri Bolt:\n\nThe House Oversight Committee and the U.S. Treasury have both launched investigations into Minnesota Governor Tim Walz's involvement in a massive fraud scheme where Somali Immigrants stole more than $1 billion from state taxpayers and funneled it to Al-Shabaab terrorists.\n\nWe know that consequences for politicians aren't what they used to be, but President Trump has been doing his best to bring them back into fashion. Here's the thing, though — unless Walz ends up in a federal penitentiary, his political career isn't going to take a hit. The Dems in Minnesota have been electing this corrupt moron to office for 20 years now. Because Democrats love entrenched corruptocrats, Walz is running for his third term as governor. \n\nBlue state Democrats have a penchant for voting for the worst that their party has to offer. At this point, there probably isn't a best, or even better, option. Zohran Mamdani and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are far more representative of the 2025 Democrats than any members of the Blue Dog Coalition who may still be hanging around. \n\nNow that I think about it, incarceration might not be enough to keep Democrats from voting for these miscreants. \n\nIt would be nice to see Tim Walz take some kind of hit for this. He is one of the most obnoxious politicians to emerge from an especially obnoxious political class. Each prominent Dem has one or two extremely unlikeable qualities, but Walz manages to throw together an entire suite of dreadful personality traits. He's even less authentic than Gavin Newsom. That's takes real effort. \n\nThat isn't a crime, but perhaps it should be. \n\nContributions to the Mailbag of Magnificence can be sent to [email protected]\n\nClick the button below to get the Morning Briefing emailed to you every weekday.

        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks will pay about $35 million to more than 15,000 New York City workers to settle claims it denied them stable schedules and arbitrarily cut their hours, city officials announced Monday, hours before Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders visited striking baristas on a picket line.\n\nThe development came amid a continuing strike by Starbucks’ union that began last month at dozens of locations around the country.\n\nThe workers want better hours and increased staffing, and they are angry that Starbucks hasn’t agreed on a contract nearly four years after workers voted to unionize at a Buffalo store. Union votes at other locations followed, and about 550 of Starbucks’ 10,000 company-owned stores are now unionized. The coffee giant also has around 7,000 licensed locations at airports, grocery stores and other locales.\n\nWorkers and the company dispute the extent and impact of the strike, but Mamdani, Sanders and some state and city officials sought to amplify the baristas’ message by mingling with scores of strikers and supporters outside a Starbucks shop in Brooklyn.\n\n“These are not demands of greed — these are demands of decency,” Mamdani, a democratic socialist who ran on pledges to aid working-class people, told the crowd. Some workers carried giant mock-ups of Starbucks takeout cups, bearing the union’s logo instead of the coffee chain’s insignia.\n\nFour years after the first shop’s union vote, “Starbucks has refused to sit down and negotiate a fair contract,” said Sanders, a Vermont independent who supported Mamdani’s campaign.\n\nA message seeking comment on the progressive politicians’ picket-line visit was sent to Starbucks.\n\nStriking baristas described a harried workplace with chronic short-staffing, online orders so complex that the ticket is sometimes longer than the cup, and last-minute calls to come in.\n\n“It is the company’s issue to give us the labor amount to schedule partners fairly, and they are not scheduling us fairly, no matter how much money we are making them,” said Gabriel Pierre, 26, a shift supervisor at a store in suburban Bellmore.\n\nStarbucks has been trying to bounce back from a period of lagging sales as inflation-conscious U.S. customers questioned whether its coffee concoctions were worth the money. The Seattle-based company recently reported the first increase in nearly two years in same-store sales — a term for sales at locations open at least a year — but restructuring costs, store redesigns and other changes took a bite out of profits in its July-September quarter.\n\nUnder the agreement announced Monday with New York City’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, Starbucks will pay $3.4 million in civil penalties, in addition to the $35 million it is paying workers. The company also agreed to comply with the city’s Fair Workweek law going forward.\n\nThe company said it’s committed to operating responsibly and complying with all applicable local laws and regulations everywhere it does business, but Starbucks also noted the complexities of the city’s law.\n\n“This is notoriously challenging to manage,” spokesperson Jaci Anderson said.\n\nMost of the affected employees who held hourly positions will receive $50 for each week worked from July 2021 through July 2024, the department said. Workers who experienced a violation after that may be eligible for compensation by filing a complaint with the department.\n\n“I sure hope that it gives Starbucks an awakening,” said Kaari Harsila, 21, a Brooklyn store shift supervisor who was picketing Monday.\n\nThe settlement also guarantees that employees laid off during recent store closings in the city will get an opportunity for reinstatement at other Starbucks locations.\n\nThe city began investigating in 2022 after receiving dozens of worker complaints against several Starbucks locations. The investigation eventually expanded to hundreds of stores. The city said the probe found, among other things, that most Starbucks employees never got regular schedules, making it difficult for staffers to plan other commitments, such as child care, education or other jobs.\n\nThe company also denied workers the chance to pick up extra shifts, so they remained part-timers even when they wanted to work more, according to the city.\n\nAssociated Press writer Bruce Shipkowski contributed from Toms River, New Jersey.",

        "text": "Brutal Fact Check\n\nPresident Donald Trump recently touted himself as the “AFFORDABILITY PRESIDENT” and suggested this branding would help his fellow Republicans win in next year’s midterm elections. His comments clearly seem borrowed from the playbook of New York City Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist whose upstart campaign was laser focused on addressing the affordability crisis in the Big Apple. \n\nOn Monday afternoon, TPM asked both Mamdani and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), another Democratic Socialist who similarly homed in on income inequality during his two presidential campaigns, what they thought of Trump’s attempt to take the mantle of “affordability.” \n\n“I will shock all of you in suggesting that the president of the United States is a pathological liar. He lies all of the time,” Sanders told us. \n\nWe spoke to Mamdani and Sanders as they joined striking Starbucks workers on the picket line in Brooklyn Monday afternoon. As the strike at the brand’s unionized stores enters its third week, New York City just announced that Starbucks agreed to pay a $38.9 million settlement for violating local laws requiring fair working conditions when it failed to provide workers with stable schedules. \n\nTrump’s latest branding move came in one of his trademark all caps declarations on his Truth Social platform last weekend. \n\n“I AM THE AFFORDABILITY PRESIDENT,” Trump wrote in the Saturday morning post. \n\nTrump based that proclamation on his claim that “DRUG PRICES ARE FALLING AT LEVELS NEVER SEEN BEFORE, 500%, 600%, 700%, and more.” He also suggested that, “if this story is properly told, we should win the Midterm Elections in RECORD NUMBERS.”\n\nExperts of all stripes have noted that Trump’s math doesn’t add up. If those numbers were true, it would mean that pharmaceutical companies were literally paying the government to distribute their drugs rather than charging anything for them. Furthermore, the policy Trump is touting that has led to some lower prices is one that was enacted by President Joe Biden. \n\nIn his comments to TPM, Sanders offered further Trump fact checking by pointing to rising health care costs stemming from the GOP’s “Big Beautiful Bill” and price increases tied to Trump’s tariffs. \n\n“To tell the people of New York City and Vermont that you are the ‘affordability president’ at a time when legislation that you have passed will be responsible — if we don’t change it — in raising healthcare premiums for people on the Affordable Care Act on average doubling, in some cases tripling, and quadrupling … maybe Trump should go out to those people who are going to see a doubling and tripling of their premiums and explain to them how he is the affordable president,” Sanders said, adding, “Not to mention that his tariffs all over this country have driven prices clearly up.”\n\nMamdani, who met with Trump in the Oval Office last month and indicated affordability was an area where they found common ground, was decidedly more diplomatic. \n\n“I would say that our focus is less on who is described as what and more that we actually deliver for the people of this city,” Mamdani told us, adding, “The focus always has to come back to working people and, when you ask these Starbucks workers what the consequences are of a company that refuses to schedule them with any predictability, of a company that refuses to pay them a wage that they can actually afford to live in this city, it is that they do not know if they can call themselves New Yorkers any longer.”\n\nMamdani, who promised to continue joining picket line protests after he is sworn in next month, stuck to his message of addressing affordability in New York and said he was “tired” of meeting workers who have to commute from out of state. \n\n“They live in places that they can afford the rent, they can afford the mortgage. That place has to become New York City once again,” Mamdani said.\n\nNeither Madani or Sanders responded to questions from TPM about whether they felt their affordability messaging had inspired Trump’s new midterms strategy. \n\n— Hunter Walker\n\nHas a Sidney Powell Conspiracy Theory Put Us on Course for War with Venezuela?\n\nBack during one of several bizarre, late-2020 press conferences, Rudy Giuliani and conservative attorney Sidney Powell walked us through a set of conspiracy theories that were meant to explain how the election was stolen from Donald Trump. “The Dominion voting systems, the Smartmatic technology software and the software that goes in other computerized coding systems here as well, not just Dominion, were created in Venezuela at the direction of Hugo Chávez,” Powell explained, rolling out a set of claims that would later be used by Trump in his push to overturn the election and would, later still, become the subject of defamation suits by the voting machine companies against various right-wing personalities and media outlets, including Fox News.\n\n“Our votes are counted in Germany and in Spain by a company owned by affiliates of Chávez and Maduro. Did you ever believe that was true?” Giuliani chimed in, a long sweaty streak of hair dye running down his temple. \n\nFive years later, defamation cases settled, Trump lawyers sanctioned, and Trump himself back in the White House, one might think this whole bizarre episode had been put to rest. But it has reared its head again. Consider:\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg, Venezuela’s opposition leader and the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado was asked whether the 2020 conspiracy theories might have anything to do with Trump’s aggressive focus on Venezuela. Machado replied that there’s “no doubt” that Maduro and others “are the masterminds of a system that has rigged elections in many countries, including the U.S.” She also stated that the U.S. was conducting an investigation into the claim, which was news. \n\nInvestigative journalist Aram Roston confirmed in a report for the Guardian that that investigation does, in fact, exist, and that federal agents have interviewed various true believers in the Venezuela theory. The investigation appears to be run out of the U.S. attorney’s office for the district of Puerto Rico. \n\nDonald Trump posted on Truth Social in support of the Venezuela claims. \n\nTrump’s seeming desire for war with Maduro’s regime has never totally made sense; Secretary of State Marco Rubio is a longtime Venezuela hawk, and that goes some way to explaining it. A desire to substantiate some of the most out-there 2020 election claims may help complete the picture. \n\n— John Light\n\nIndiana GOP Senator Says ‘No’ to Redistricting After Trump Uses Slur\n\nGOP Indiana state Sen. Michael Bohacek said on Friday that he will vote against redistricting when the Senate convenes to discuss President Trump’s gerrymandering maps after the president used a slur to describe Minnesota’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz.\n\n“The seriously retarded Governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, does nothing, either through fear, incompetence, or both,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social last week, insulting Walz as he launched into an unhinged screed about Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and elevated conspiracy theories about her family. \n\n“This is not the first time our president has used these insulting and derogatory references and his choices of words have consequences,” Republican state Sen. Mike Bohacek wrote on Facebook in a post explaining that his daughter has Down Syndrome.\n\n“I will be voting NO on redistricting, perhaps he can use the next 10 months to convince voters that his policies and behavior deserve a congressional majority,” he added. \n\nBohacek’s statement comes at a critical point for Trump’s larger redistricting pressure campaign, which appears to be losing steam in red states across the country. \n\nThe Indiana House will vote on a new map this week. The Senate will convene on December 8, but it remains unclear whether the Senate has enough support to approve a map. The map needs approval from both the state House and the Senate before the governor can sign off on it.\n\n— Khaya Himmelman\n\nIn Case You Missed It\n\nYesterday’s Most Read Story\n\nWhat We Are Reading\n\nTrump Boat Bombings Suddenly on Shakier Ground as Damning Info Emerges",

        "text": "Washington, DC, Council member Janeese Lewis George, a Democratic Socialist, launched her campaign for mayor of the nation’s capital on Monday – and she’s reportedly seeking to emulate Zohran Mamdani’s New York City mayoral bid. \n\nLewis George, 37, is seeking to replace DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, who announced last week that she would not seek re-election to a fourth term. \n\n“Rent’s rising in homes people can’t afford. Folks are working hard and still feeling the squeeze, while the few in power rake in profits,” Lewis George said in a video announcing her run for mayor, echoing the rhetoric that propelled Mamdani to victory in the Big Apple. \n\n“And now our neighbors, our families, are under attack because we are failing to stand up to defend them,” the council member continued, as images of federal agents arresting people on the street played in the background. \n\n“That’s not the D.C., I know. That’s why I’m running for mayor,” Lewis George declared. “Because it’s time we had leaders who fight for the people who stand up to corruption and greed and stand with the people who make D.C. work.” \n\nAxios reported last month that Lewis George was aiming to build a 5,000-members strong volunteer army to knock on doors and phone bank. \n\nHer campaign was also hoping to bring on one of the Mamdani campaign’s top top digital advisers and target young voters online and on TikTok. \n\nLewis George has served on the DC Council since 2021. \n\nShe was endorsed by the DC chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), who congratulated “our chapter member” after her 2020 victory in the Ward 4 election. \n\n“Janeese’s grassroots, people-powered victories, both in the primary and in the general election, show that Ward 4 residents are tired of the big business and developer-friendly politics … Metro D.C. DSA is confident that George will be an elected leader who stands with the working class,” the group said in 2020. \n\nLike Mamdani, Lewis George has faced criticism for her past support for defunding the police. \n\n“I will absolutely divest from [DC’s Metropolitan Police Department] and put that money into violence interruption programs. Full stop,” she wrote on X in October 2019. \n\nLewis George walked back her support for defunding the police during her 2020 campaign. \n\nThe council member told the Washington Post that as mayor, she would focus on “evidence-based strategies to prevent crime,” suggesting swift punishment but short sentences for criminals work best. \n\n“We’ve focused a lot in the city on sentencing,” Lewis George told the outlet, “but what I’ve learned in law school and as a prosecutor is what deters crime is an individual knowing — am I going to get caught, and what are the chances of me being held accountable?”\n\nPresident Trump surged federal law enforcement into the nation’s capital earlier this year and federalized the district’s police department as part of a sweeping crime crackdown — moves staunchly opposed by Lewis George. \n\nBowser was critical of Trump’s DC takeover but later acknowledged that it was helping reduce crime in DC.",

        "text": "Last month, two starkly contrasting views on the American experiment were put on full display. In November, Blue Origin, the Jeff Bezos-owned spaceflight company, became the second company to land an orbital-class first-stage booster, a reusable rocket stage that powers its initial ascent. On the same day, the anti-capitalist chorus was posting online about “billionaire tears.” Taking to X.com, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), posing with mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and his transition team co-chair and former FTC head Lina Khan, said, “Tax the rich. Billionaire tears not pictured.”\n\nThis contrast of builders vs. central planners manifests the stark difference in their worldviews. The builders are driven by optimism, recognizing the unprecedented prosperity brought about by American capitalism, a system fully tapping into the human spirit. They understand the endless value-creating potential economic freedom continues to offer. The central planners are driven by envy. Government cannot create and innovate in the way a free, robust private sector empowers individuals to do, and those who build must be punished for not doing with their money what central planners think is best.\n\nWhat Blue Origin accomplished is nothing short of remarkable. Not only is it the second company to land an orbital-class first-stage booster, but the second institution on Earth ever to do so — a feat no national space agency or government has ever demonstrated. SpaceX became the first in 2015.\n\nThe increasing ability to land boosters offers exceptionally consequential benefits to humanity. Unlike the Space Shuttle, which required astronauts aboard and meaningfully reused only its crew-carrying orbiter, the ability to recover this type of booster, and to do so without people on board, is a fundamentally different approach. Because the booster is the most expensive part of the launch stack, reusing it dramatically cuts costs. Furthermore, the ability to launch without humans on board means these launches don’t need to meet stringent human-rating requirements. This makes satellite, deep-space, and other scientific missions far more efficient — a game changer.\n\nThe central planners fundamentally misunderstand money, viewing it as a zero-sum game. Entrepreneurs investing their fortunes into space innovation expands the pie rather than slice it thinner. They are creating value for everyday people.\n\nLow-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite internet, already connecting millions, can extend high-quality broadband to rural America swiftly and on the cheap compared to traditional infrastructure. Modern weather forecasting, dependent on LEO sensors, means earlier tornado warnings, better hurricane tracking, and more precise rainfall predictions. And deep-space missions, now a fraction of the cost to launch, bolster research, expand our ability to study solar storms, detect near-Earth asteroids, and understand the broader universe. None of this happens at scale without reusable boosters: reuse makes LEO broadband economically viable, weather data collection more frequent and accurate, and deep-space science drastically lower in cost.\n\nAnd space innovation is just one of many examples. As government-imposed lockdowns kept us at home during the pandemic, Amazon’s logistical network, employing more than 1.5 million workers, became essential infrastructure, enabling millions of Americans to receive groceries, medications, and other basic goods in two days or less as the virus surged.\n\nYet instead of recognizing the obvious public benefit, many on the Left complained about how much Bezos’ wealth increased amid Amazon’s surging sales. Amy Goodman of Democracy Now! asserted, “Billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg all saw their bank accounts swell amidst the global crisis.” Rep. Rashida Tlaib called his pandemic-era wealth increase “immoral.”\n\nIf the “billionaires shouldn’t exist” crowd has its way, the technologies that rely on affordable access to space, the jobs created by companies like Amazon, and the logistical lifelines that softened the pandemic’s bite would not exist. Musk and Bezos pay billions in taxes, and the revenue from taxing them out of billionaire status would be far less beneficial to society writ large than allowing it to be privately and continually invested.\n\nNot only is the private sector far better and more efficient at driving human flourishing than government, but this level of wealth confiscation wouldn’t be enough to pay even a fraction of most of the Left’s projects. The Cato Institute reported in 2023 that “If Congress confiscated every dollar earned by individuals and businesses past their first $500,000, it would still be about $200 billion short of covering the cost of next year’s projected $1.7 trillion deficit.”\n\nThe examples of market-driven innovation creating value for society are endless, and profit shouldn’t be a dirty word. The American story of unprecedented prosperity is one driven by pioneers, inventors, and entrepreneurs willing to take risks, not by envy, central planning, and redistributionism. To turn our backs on economic freedom — something that rewards risk-takers rather than punishing them — would leave us all far less free, less dynamic, and less prosperous.\n\nEd Tarnowski is a Senior Young Voices Contributor and a Policy and Advocacy Director at EdChoice, where he hosts the State of Choice podcast.

        "text": "JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) — Former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey’s bid for a political comeback comes down to a one-on-one runoff Tuesday against an opponent who has denounced him and his scandal-stained exit from the governor’s office two decades ago as the epitome of “politics of the past.”\n\nMcGreevey and James Solomon are the last candidates standing in a race for mayor of Jersey City, a community across the Hudson River from Manhattan that is sometimes referred to as New York City’s sixth borough. Like last month’s elections in New York and elsewhere, the race has focused heavily on affordability, particularly the high cost of housing. \n\nThe contest advanced to a runoff after no candidate tallied more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 4 general election, when seven people were on the ballot. Solomon, a city council member since 2017, finished first. McGreevey placed second. Both are Democrats, though the race is nonpartisan. Polls close at 8 p.m.\n\nMcGreevey is running for public office for the first time since he resigned as governor in 2004 — a stunning announcement remembered mostly for the spectacle of him declaring: “I am a gay American.” His exit was driven in part by controversy over his decision to hire a man he said was his lover, ex-Israeli naval officer Golan Cipel, as the state’s homeland security adviser in 2002 despite Cipel’s lack of qualifications.\n\nHe launched his mayoral campaign in 2023 with a social media video titled: “Second chances are central to who I am.”\n\n“I want Jersey City to be Jersey City,” McGreevey said in a recent interview. “That is: an iconic city in the Garden State reflecting the hopes and the aspirations of families.”\n\nMcGreevey, 68, has pledged to be a one-term mayor, calling it “a great closing act” on his career. He has touted his experience as an elected leader — both as governor and before that as mayor of suburban Woodbridge Township — and said he’d back Solomon for mayor in four years.\n\nSolomon, 41, said McGreevey’s background is “experience we don’t want.”\n\n“There were just scandal after scandal after scandal,” Solomon said in a recent interview. “That, to me, is disqualifying.”\n\nThe race to run New Jersey’s second-largest city has centered on the cost of living, echoing national concerns. New downtown development catering to affluent New York City commuters is driving overall prices higher, and the city is struggling with a budget shortfall that threatens to hike property taxes. New York City’s mayor-elect, democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, won last month on an affordability platform over another ex-governor looking to make a comeback, Andrew Cuomo.\n\nJersey City is a swath of high-rises and immigrant neighborhoods with about 303,000 residents and a municipal budget of about $700 million. The current mayor, Steven Fulop, declined to seek a fourth term.\n\nMcGreevey has spent about $2.5 million on his campaign. Solomon has spent about $1.3 million. \n\nBoth candidates have vowed to stand up to President Donald Trump, whose administration is suing to end Jersey City’s so-called sanctuary city protections for immigrants. \n\n“If Donald Trump chooses a fight, we’re not going to back down,” Solomon said.\n\nMcGreevey was born in Jersey City and returned to live there in 2015. It’s where his grandfather sought a new life after being forced out of Northern Ireland and where he’s made a new life for himself.\n\nAfter a divorce, McGreevey attended an Episcopal seminary, earned a Master of Divinity degree, volunteered at a Harlem ministry and took steps to become a priest. He later moved into nonprofit work.\n\nHe’s currently executive director of the Jersey City-based New Jersey Reentry Corporation, a non-profit that helps formerly incarcerated people and returning veterans find work and housing.\n\nSolomon grew up in nearby Millburn, has a master’s degree from Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and was an aide to former Boston Mayor Thomas Menino.\n\nHe moved to Jersey City in 2013, is married and he and his wife have three daughters. In 2015, he was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. Now in full remission, he said that challenge inspired him to run for public office.\n\n“I had one of these life is short moments,” Solomon said. “I was like, ‘you know, I think I can do something. I can give back to Jersey City, because Jersey City really had my back during my toughest time.’”\n\nSolomon has vowed to take on developers and special interests, invest in public safety and work with the independent board of education to improve the city’s schools. He said he plans to build on legislation he passed as a council member, including banning rent-hiking algorithms and ensuring tenants have a right to legal counsel.\n\nAlong with affordability, McGreevey said, his immediate concern is an estimated $150 million budget hole that could hike property taxes 30% if not fixed.\n\nHe said he’ll devote his term to making sure “we’re on a road of fiscal sanity and to make sure that Jersey City’s working families aren’t driven out by the downtown crowd.”",

        "text": "Far-left New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani hasn’t even taken office yet, but the state has already been hard at work coddling illegal aliens and defying the Trump administration’s efforts to get criminal non-citizens off the streets. In fact, in this year alone, they’ve released almost 7,000 illegals, some of them accused of nasty crimes.\n\nThese are the kind of people the left-leaning state is protecting instead of its citizens:\n\nNew York state has released nearly 7,000 known illegal migrant criminals without notifying ICE since President Trump took office — including murderers, sexual predators and a maniac booted from the US eight times who attacked an Ithaca cop with a machete, the Department of Homeland Security revealed Monday.Their rap sheets include 29 homicides, thousands of assaults and hundreds of burglaries, robberies, drug offenses, weapons offenses and sexual predatory offenses, according to DHS.\n\nThere are also thousands more still in NYC jails. \n\nThis is all thanks to sanctuary laws, which prohibit regular law enforcement from cooperating with ICE. Assistant Secretary at the Department of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin on Monday railed against Democrats like Gov. Kathy Hochul and Rep. Dan Goldman (NY-10) for putting the public at risk:\n\nWe're saying that these criminal illegal aliens are exiting the jails and going back onto New York or Chicago or these other sanctuary streets to re perpetuate their crimes. Today, in New York City's jails are 7,169 criminal illegal aliens. We're talking about hundreds of murderers, hundreds of sexual predators, drug traffickers, the worst of the worst.\n\nShe continued:\n\nDan Goldman and these other sanctuary city politicians, they should agree to hand over those individuals, honor those detainers, and then we won't have to flood the zone with our ICE law enforcement. We won't have to put those men and women on the ground because we will get these vicious criminals out of New York City's jails.\n\nShe also tweeted that almost 7,000 have been let out on the streets:\n\n-29 homicides-2,509 assaults-207 sexual predatory offenses-199 burglaries-305 robberies-392 dangerous drugs offenses-300 weapons offensesThis is why we flood the zone.\n\nHere are just a couple of the lovelies set free by the state, only (thankfully) later to be nabbed by ICE:\n\nVyacheslav Danilovich Kim — who was busted for traveling to have sex with a girl whom he believed was 13 years old.Steven Daniel Henriquez Galicia, 25, a Dominican national who entered the US illegally in 2016, was arrested in the Bronx last year for attempted murder after he allegedly opened fire outside an apartment building. Anderson Smith Satuye Martinez, 21, a Crips gang member and Honduran national with a prior assault conviction, was busted Aug. 19 for criminal possession of a weapon and possession of a controlled substance. \n\nICE Director Todd Lyons sent a letter to NY Attorney General Letitia James on Monday demanding that they release the illegals still in custody to ICE. Expect the TDS-riddled AG to ignore his request.\n\nThe sanctuary laws date back to disgraced former Empire State Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who recently lost the mayoral race to Mamdani. If there were ever a choice between two evils, that was it.\n\nNew York’s sanctuary laws tie the hands of law enforcement when cooperating with immigration agents, which crime suspects and even convicted child molesters are released back into the community — instead of being sent home.A 2017 executive order signed by then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo prohibits law enforcement officers from using “resources, equipment, or personnel” for helping feds enforce immigration laws.\n\nAs we’ve seen in blue state after blue state and deteriorating city after deteriorating city, Democrats are more concerned with fighting ICE and Trump than making our neighborhoods safe. Sanctuary policies need to go the way of the dodo bird and become extinct, because, as has been proven over and over, they’re simply bad for America.\n\nEditor’s Note: Thanks to President Trump, illegal immigration into our great country has virtually stopped. Despite the radical left's lies, new legislation wasn't needed to secure our border, just a new president.\n\nHelp us continue to report the truth about the president's border policies and mass deportations.

When he left office in January the 12.9-million worker strong manufacturing industry had been restored to pre-pandemic levels, only to see losses return under Trump.\n\nEconomist Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research told Newsweek that Trump’s tariffs are the crux of the problem.\n\n“Companies are reluctant to invest in a context where they have no idea what tariffs will be in place six months from now, much less three to five years from now,” Baker said. He also noted that demand for products is down because tariff costs reduce consumers’ spending money.\n\nThe president’s executive actions have also hurt manufacturing. Trump has targeted green energy programs for elimination and defunding, but these were areas of growth for manufacturing. Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which funded manufacturing projects in the clean energy sector and contributed to job growth.\n\nThe Democratic Party lambasted Trump’s failure on manufacturing jobs in a statement.\n\n“Trump has no real plans to deliver for working families,” DNC Rapid Response Director Kendall Witmer said. “He sold them out to line the pockets of his ultrawealthy friends, bail out foreign countries, and build his $350 million gold ballroom.”\n\nRepublicans have already paid a price for Trump’s weakened economy.\n\nDemocratic candidates like New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger defeated Republicans while campaigning on promises to address affordability as prices increase. Republicans like Trump have given lip service to dealing with these concerns but have not offered solutions, a stance in line with the right’s history of inaction on the topic.\n\nWhen he first took office in 2017, Trump inherited an economy in recovery following the leadership of former President Barack Obama. The country’s fortunes were reversed under Trump, only to see a turnaround under Biden once he took office in 2021.\n\nNow Trump is on a trajectory to repeat his past failures after promising to fix all of the country’s ills on Day 1.\n\nRelated | Trump issues executive order targeting 'unreliable' clean energy options",

Along with seven other senators, he’s formed a coalition that calls itself the “Fight Club.” The group—which includes Democratic senators Tina Smith of Minnesota, Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, plus Vermont independent Bernie Sanders—plans to press Schumer to oppose Trump more aggressively and to back more populist Senate candidates in the 2026 midterms. Arizona’s Mark Kelly has been showing plenty of fight on his own, urging members of the military to defy illegal orders.\nSince the end of the shutdown, some House Democrats and liberal groups have been going further, calling for Schumer’s ouster. “He should be replaced,” a major Democratic donor tells me. “He can’t hold his caucus together.” Combined with the attacks Schumer faced in March for voting in favor of a Republican funding bill, it’s been his roughest year since becoming the Senate Democratic leader in 2017. “The level of frustration with him is certainly higher than I’ve seen in my time,” a senior Democratic Senate operative says.\nWhich is a long way from actually trying to remove Schumer as leader, of course, which no Senate Democrat has advocated so far. Schumer’s camp points out, correctly, that past Senate leaders, including Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell, have endured far greater internal dissatisfaction, and that most of the current sniping comes from progressive Democrats who represent safely blue states or districts. Schumer believes the path to a Senate majority, and to stymieing Trump, remains up the ideological middle.\nSchumer will soon have a chance to demonstrate that, at the age of 75, he can still wield power, and do it on an issue of enormous consequence to millions of Americans. In mid-November, when voting to end the government shutdown, Senate Democratic defectors pointed to what they claimed was a big win: extracting a Republican promise to hold a vote, in mid-December, on extending federal subsidies for Obamacare premiums. In advance of that showdown, reports have surfaced of the Trump White House’s health care proposals—like tax-advantaged savings accounts and income caps for Obamacare enrollees—that Democrats should find easy to oppose. “Republicans—the smart ones anyway—have gotta be peeing in their pants at the idea that Trump is gonna demand massive changes to the health care system a year before the election,” says Jim Manley, who was a top aide to Schumer’s predecessor atop the Senate Democrats, Nevada’s Harry Reid.\n“As of now, the two sides are pretty far apart,” a Senate Democratic insider says. “All the signs are pointing toward this not being resolved and people being saddled with higher costs.” In contrast to the shutdown, this time it will probably be the Republicans who are splintered over competing health care proposals. The GOP might offer a deal that extends Affordable Care Act subsidies while whittling away at some of its benefits. As the year-end deadline closes in and the prospect of skyrocketing premiums looms, Schumer will be under pressure to keep his caucus together.\n“What’s gonna happen on December 15 is a unified vote. I spent Saturday and Sunday speaking to every member of my caucus,” Schumer tells me in an interview Monday, speaking with considerable heat, before connecting the current maneuvering with next year’s midterms. “I’ve recruited damn good candidates and expanded the map. My North Star is taking back the Senate, in good part by making health care the issue, and we have a good chance of doing that. I’ve always focused on doing a good job for New York, for our caucus, and for the country, and it’s always worked out.”\nThat last part is debatable. What’s certain is that Schumer doesn’t sound remotely interested in leaving leadership anytime soon, and that, despite the noise generated by people like California Democratic congressman Ro Khanna, he retains significant support inside the caucus. “He is good at his job,” says Vermont’s Peter Welch, one of several Senate Democrats who volunteered to speak about Schumer’s value as leader. “We’ve got a caucus that goes from Fetterman to Sanders, and his job is to guide the caucus and give license to the various members to speak their mind and to create consensus. On the shutdown he was clear-eyed from day one that we had to make health care the focus.”\nSome polls seem to vindicate Schumer’s shutdown strategy by showing Republicans taking the bulk of the blame. “It’s hard for me to imagine a situation where there’s an appetite for a huge open caucus fight right now over replacing him,” the senior Senate operative says, “especially heading into an election year.” And also because Schumer himself will be up for reelection in 2028. The assumption in New York political circles is that Schumer will retire rather than battle for a sixth term, with speculation already ramping up about a possible primary face-off between former governor Andrew Cuomo and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. A recent Siena College poll showed Schumer with a job approval rating of 32% among New York state voters, his lowest number in 21 years.\nVan Hollen, while calling on Democrats to show more spine in the short term, may also be playing the long game. When I ask about recent chatter that he’d be a good successor to Schumer, he demurs, sort of. “It’s not something I’ve been pursuing,” Van Hollen says. Yet this fall, he criticized senior Democratic leadership for not endorsing Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, and he is worried that establishment Democrats still haven’t gotten the message from Mamdani’s victory or from Trump’s win in 2024. “The fundamental issue here is that hardworking people felt they were being left behind,” Van Hollen tells me. “And people did not have confidence that the Democrats were gonna shake things up for the better.”",

        "text": "It’s that time of year when we all feel a little more generous. Gifts and shopping are on our minds – and filling up that space under the Christmas tree. \n\nTwo incoming big-city mayors are also feeling that holiday spirit. The difference is that they have big plans to be generous with your money.\n\nNew York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, 34, has attracted most of the national buzz, but he isn’t the only democratic socialist to win the vote this November.\n\nSeattle voters chose Katie Wilson, 43, to be their next mayor, and she shares many of Mamdani’s pie-in-the-sky policies. America’s warming to anti-capitalist ideals is alarming to say the least.\n\nSeattle Mayor-elect Katie Wilson joins NY Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in promising free stuff\n\nHere’s a partial list of what Wilson “wants,” in her own words: “I want everyone in this great city of ours to have a roof over their head. I want universal child care, free K through 8 summer care. … I want social housing. I want much more land and wealth to be owned and stewarded by communities instead of corporations.”\n\n(Wilson seems to want to benefit personally from her campaign ideas. She has admitted to needing financial help from her parents to help pay for child care.) \n\nOn the other side of the country, Mamdani’s to-do list includes “free” child care, “free” buses, a rent freeze and government-run grocery stores. \n\nGuess what? All of those things are extremely costly. Even more concerning is these socialists’ desire to get the government much more entrenched in business and daily life. \n\nTrump has called Mamdani a 'communist.' Is he right? \n\nBefore Mamdani’s election in November, President Donald Trump actively campaigned against him, calling him a “communist lunatic.” \n\nWhile Mamdani has demurred that label, preferring the more palatable-sounding “democratic socialist,” some of the ideas he’s advocated get uncomfortably close. \n\nFor example, when speaking at the 2021 Young Democratic Socialists of America conference, he said that socialists like himself “firmly believe in” the “end goal of seizing the means of production” – something he admitted may not be popular at the moment but nevertheless deserved to be promoted. \n\nSeizing the means of production is a central tenet of communism.\n\nMamdani likes calling names, too, and like many other progressives, has lobbed the “fascist” label at Trump. \n\nSo it was surprising to see the two politicians together Nov. 21 in the Oval Office – an event dubbed a “love fest.” Both of them deserve credit for at least talking to each other about their ideas for improving New York. However, Mamdani maintained the “fascist” insult, even in front of Trump. \n\nI do wonder how many actual fascists have met so warmly with their political opponents?\n\nSocialism has been tried around the world. It always fails.\n\nShortly before Mamdani’s meeting with Trump, Congress marked its concern with the country’s largest city now having a socialist as mayor. \n\nIt passed a resolution denouncing the horrors of socialism, 285-98, with 86 Democrats joining the Republican majority. That includes House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Jeffries waited until the last minute to endorse Mamdani. \n\nAccording to a press release from resolution sponsor Rep. María Elvira Salazar, R-Florida, “The resolution outlines some of the most brutal crimes committed by socialist regimes in the Soviet Union, China, Cambodia, North Korea, Cuba, and Venezuela, demonstrating that wherever socialism has taken root, the results have been the same: famine, repression, death, economic ruin, and the loss of human freedom.”\n\nJust look south to Argentina, which is climbing out of an economy that was destroyed by socialism (thanks to the strong leadership of its pro-capitalism President Javier Milei). In 2023, ahead of Milei’s election, annual inflation reached an unfathomable 148%.\n\nIt’s baffling that Americans are falling for such a dangerous ideology. But they are. \n\nA recent poll of likely voters from The Heartland Institute and Rasmussen Reports showed that 51% of young Americans, ages 18-39, would like to see a democratic socialist in the White House. \n\nMamdani and Wilson have put a shiny bow on their socialist ideas, and voters bought it. \n\nBeware what comes next.\n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

Mallory, who has repeatedly advocated for defunding the police and eventually abolishing police altogether, was tapped by Mamdani to help lead his Committee on Public Safety, according to a press release published on Brooklyn community site BRIC. She is one of 400 \"experts\" appointed by Mamdani to the transition team. In the release, Mamdani said the 400 \"esteemed leaders\" represent the \"top talent\" who \"will be instrumental to ensuring we hit the ground running on January 1st — and that our results align with the promises we’ve made.\" The release said that appointees will serve as \"critical advisors on personnel appointments, as well as provide insights on policy development, implementation, and agency best practices.\" DEM REP. RITCHIE TORRES SHREDS MAMDANI ON FAILURE TO CONDEMN 'INTIFADA' LANGUAGE Mallory stepped down from The Women's March in 2019 after facing backlash for her praise of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, a notorious antisemite who compared Jews to termites. She has repeatedly praised Farrakhan, including repeatedly calling him an \"honorable minister\" and the \"greatest of all time because of what he’s done in black communities.\" Mallory was also seen attending an event where Farrakhan said that \"the powerful Jew is my enemy.\" Mallory was confronted by hosts of \"The View\" for her support for Farrakhan in a 2019 episode. \"Tamika, you came under some fire for your relationship with Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam,\" host Sunny Hostin said. \"He’s known for being anti-Semitic, for being homophobic, but you do attend his events, and you posted… a photo calling him the G.O.A.T., which means the greatest of all time. You are running an organization that says it fights bigotry. Do you understand why your association with him is quite problematic?\" Mallory fired back, \"I think it’s important to put my attendance, my presence at Savior’s Day, which is the highest holy day for the Nation of Islam, in proper context.\" She added, \"As a leader, as a black leader, in a country that is still dealing with some very serious, unresolved issues, as it relates to the black experience in this country,\" she often has to go into \"difficult spaces\" to promote her cause. MAMDANI'S TOP INCOMING AIDE WAS 'CHIEF ARCHITECT' OF RADICAL PROPOSAL OVERHAULING NYPD Mallory said that \"just because you go into a space with someone that does not mean that you agree with everything that they say,\" but Hostin immediately pushed back, asking, \"Why call him the greatest of all time?\" \"I didn’t call him the greatest of all time because of his rhetoric. I called him the greatest of all time because of what he’s done in black communities,\" Mallory added. After stepping down from her leadership role at Women’s March, Mallory continued to step into controversy. In a 2020 interview, she said, \"I definitely support the term ‘defund the police.’ I am not the author of it, but I have adopted the language…especially thinking about Black Lives Matter and the organization and the movement of Black lives and others who have really coined the phrase and have been pushing it out there. I support it 100 percent.\" In the same interview, Mallory said, \"I do believe that one day we can abolish police.\" Writing on X in 2021, Mallory again stated, \"Defund. The.

[and] for vulnerable New Yorkers,” huffed Nurse, as if that (supposed) cause somehow justifies blocking traffic, defying police orders and pelting cops and federal agents with debris.\n\nThese rabble-rousers were breaking the law — and should pay for it.\n\nPlus: “Vulnerable New Yorkers” is a dubious description of ICE’s presumed targets: illegal-immigrant criminals, possibly violent.\n\nYet Williams even promised repeat performances “every single time” the feds try to do their job.\n\nMaybe these pols should face incitement charges; they certainly shouldn’t be anywhere near public office.\n\nHow will Mamdani come down? He, too, has vowed to fight President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, and also called for the elimination of the Strategic Response Group, the NYPD unit on the scene Saturday and generally responds to such chaos.\n\nPush hard enough, and you give Trump reason to send in the National Guard — which Mamdani also opposes.\n\nYet the feds should also step carefully: How did they let word of the operation leak to the activists, and why didn’t the give the NYPD a heads-up about it? \n\nTisch was reportedly furious that her cops got caught in the middle; she believes large showings of federal force are generally unnecessary and too often inflammatory.\n\nTellingly, Homeland Security Special Agent in Charge Ricky Patel reportedly called her to apologize after Saturday’s mess.\n\nAbove all else, though, it’s the protesters most at fault, along with the pols who encourage them.\n\nIf Mamdani can’t work out a responsible plan to let federal agents to do their job, the ugliness will get a lot worse than Saturday’s turmoil.",

        "text": "During the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated economic downturn, many people couldn’t pay their transportation costs, and often didn’t. In New York City in 2021, some 21 percent of bus riders did not pay the fare, a figure that grew to 48 percent in 2024. Some local governments, including New York City, responded with reduced or free fare programs. From 2023 to 2024, New York’s Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) ran a zero-fare bus pilot that served around 43,000 riders. The pilot, championed by then-assembly member Zohran Mamdani, offered free trips on one bus in each borough.\n\nTo expand this small pilot to universal zero-fare buses throughout New York City is a tall task, with a total 2024 bus ridership of 409 million and 6,300 buses. As mayor-elect Mamdani and his administration look to grow zero-fare buses in New York, they have a stellar example just a few hours south of New York, in Maryland.\n\nThe largest free bus program in Maryland by ridership is in Montgomery County, a suburb north of Washington, D.C.\n\nMontgomery County first made its “Ride On” buses free to all riders under 18 in 2019. Then on June 29, 2025, it made all of its buses fare-free for all passengers. The system has a fleet of nearly 400 buses, 80 routes, and provided 19.2 million rides in the 2025 fiscal year. In the three months since free fares were instituted, ridership has increased by 5.4 percent. Phil McLaughlin, General Manager of Transit Services for Montgomery County Department of Transportation (MCDOT), said an estimated 1 percent to 2 percent of that ridership increase came from instituting zero fares.\n\nOne reason Montgomery Country’s City Council adopted the zero-fare program was financial. Montgomery County reduced fares during the pandemic from $2 to $1 and saw lower fare revenues (dropping from $10 million to roughly $1.6 million) overall. When faced with the need to upgrade its fare collection systems to tap-to-pay in order to align its fare boxes with Washington D.C.’s Metro system, it became clear that replacing the fare boxes would cost more than they would recoup: The cost was estimated at $22 million and would take approximately eight years to begin turning a profit. In addition, it cost the county $557,000 annually to collect fares. Montgomery County was faced with either paying police to enforce fares or going fare-free. County Executive Marc Elrich proposed a fully fare-free bus system in his 2026 fiscal year proposed operating budget, and the county council adopted it soon after.\n\nMontgomery County Councilmember Evan Glass, chair of the Council’s Transportation & Environment Committee, told Truthout that fare-free buses are “bringing real impacts for Montgomery County residents” and the increased ridership shows that “cost barriers make a real difference. In a county with a median income of $115,000, compared to $35,000 for the average bus rider, fare-free transit is fundamentally about equity.”\n\nThe oldest free bus program in Maryland is likely Baltimore’s Charm City Circulator (CCC), first established in 2010 by then-mayor Sheila Dixon and funded through state transportation department grants. In 2024, the CCC provided 1.43 million rides, according to the Baltimore City Department of Transportation. The CCC has over 100 stops along five routes, with buses arriving every 13-20 minutes, and operates on an $8 million budget. Its impact has been overwhelmingly positive: a 2022 rider survey showed that over 40 percent of people who use the CCC would have used single-occupancy vehicles to make their trips, if not for this free service, thus reducing overall traffic congestion and vehicle emissions.\n\nThese programs, while crucial, still need to be built upon. Previously, local residents have pointed out that the bus service has a history of disproportionately serving majority-white neighborhoods and tourist mainstays, and has connected primarily to the city’s largest predominantly white institutions such as Johns Hopkins and the University of Maryland, while not offering the same level of service to majority-Black neighborhoods or Baltimore’s historically Black colleges and universities, such as Morgan State University or Coppin State. More public investment in the city-wide transit programs can help bridge the gap. In one promising improvement, Baltimore mayor Brendan Scott recently announced an expansion of the CCC to three East Baltimore neighborhoods beginning on December 7. The Baltimore City Department of Transportation told Truthout that the expansion is aimed at “improving equity of city services” and that it will add fast, free transit options to “communities that have relatively low vehicle ownership.”\n\nDr. Lawrence Brown, a research scientist in the Center for Urban Health Equity at Morgan State University, told Truthout that while “there is still work to be done,” the changes to the CCC since 2020 — including the Cherry Hill line addition in 2024 (which serves a neighborhood that is 90 percent Black and historically redlined) — “represents a change in the right direction.” Dr. Brown elaborated that “The Green line changes are definitely an improvement from an equity perspective as it extends into historically redlined central East Baltimore,” but “the Brooklyn/Curtis Bay community is still being left out although it also has tremendous transit needs.”\n\nIn an interview, Minister Glenn Isaac Smith, co-founder and President Baltimore Transit Equity Coalition, told Truthout, “We had long advocated for the extension of the circulator” including its expansion into Cherry Hill, and called the November changes “a welcome addition.” He continued, “The East Baltimore extension will service people who need transportation and a lot of times cannot afford it, especially if they are on a fixed income and need to travel to doctor’s appointments, or need to travel to buy groceries since it’s a food desert.”\n\nWest of Baltimore, the more rural but quickly-growing Frederick County made all of its mass transit free at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and never went back. Transit Services of Frederick County, which includes buses and a paratransit service called Transit Plus, served a little shy of 1 million riders in fiscal year 2025 [928,650 riders], a record ridership for the county (up from over 540,000 trips in FY2022). It operates on a $9.3 million budget and has six lines and a fleet of 48 buses, four of which are all-electric and powered by a solar array at the Frederick County landfill, according to an emailed statement from Mary Dennis, Communications Manager for Transit Services of Frederick County. Its buses also serve many of the local food banks in Frederick, a fact advertised on Frederick Transit’s homepage.\n\nFrederick resident and Transit Plus rider Jose Gabriel Coronado Flores, who uses a wheelchair, told Truthout that “I’m glad price is no longer a concern.” Coronado Flores pointed out that Transit Plus’ scheduled hours interfere with civic participation for the elderly and disabled people who rely on it, as many Frederick County government meetings happen later in the evening, when Transit Plus no longer schedules trips. This “keeps out many disabled people from participating in the processes which have to do with them,” Coronado Flores said.\n\nChristian Benford, a candidate for Frederick County Council, told Truthout, “It is fantastic to have a program that provides alternative travel, reduces carbon emissions, and is at no-cost to residents.” Benford also pointed out improvements could be made to accessibility in the county overall, adding, “Frederick, as a whole, is not very walkable. So, while there are stops at key locations, it still requires crossing dangerous intersections or moving on uneven or poorly maintained public infrastructure.”\n\nLike New York, Maryland faced reduced fare collections on buses in the state during the pandemic. Rather than increasing enforcement, Montgomery County and Frederick County, implemented temporary reduced or zero-fare measures. Seeing the financial and public benefits, both counties went fully zero-fare permanently. Zero-fare buses address a key equity gap noted in a 2024 report by Montgomery County called “Ride On Reimagined,” which found that 27 percent of Montgomery County residents in Maryland make less than $20,000 a year, showing the need for free public transit to connect residents to jobs and education. Maryland’s zero-fare bus programs provide an important model to the incoming Mamdani administration and others who want increased equity in their cities.\n\nMore can and should be done in Maryland, as these advancements in buses are coming amid a $2.1 billion statewide shortfall in public transit funding, leading to the elimination of many new road and transit projects. In Baltimore, a light rail extension called the Red Line was cancelled in 2015, and “set transportation in Baltimore back ten years,” said Smith. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore has made getting the Red Line built one of his platform promises, and Smith said, “We look forward to further expansions into the east-west corridor” of Baltimore.\n\nLike in New York, there is much coordination that needs to take place between state, city, and county governing bodies to make public transit deliver better for all its residents. But Benford, at least, sees opportunity in what’s left to be done: “This is a great instance to foster better partnership between the county and city councils to engage with constituents. We may have different governing bodies but should always look for meaningful ways to work together.”",

        "text": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nFor the past few weeks, President Donald Trump has seemed uncharacteristically passive. His own Republican Party bucked him on the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein—in a movement partly led by Marjorie Taylor Greene, who once seemed like his staunchest apostle. His U.S. House gerrymandering campaign faltered under opposition from the GOP in deep-red Indiana, of all places. He even seemed awed by Zohran Mamdani, the mayor-elect of New York City, in an Oval Office meeting.\n\nIn recent days, though, the president has posted a series of angry tirades, apparently determined to reclaim his role driving the news.\n\nDuring his first administration, Trump seemed to sow the most chaos after hours on Twitter, when his advisers had gone home for the night. His second administration may have no more “adults in the room,” yet the timing, during a holiday when he had more free time and fewer constraints, seems noteworthy. The stretch began with an awful event Wednesday night—the shooting of two West Virginia National Guard members, one fatal, in Washington, D.C., where Trump had deployed them. The suspect is Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan man who worked with the CIA during the American war in his country before seeking refuge in the United States and receiving asylum this past April.\n\nIn volatile situations, Trump can almost always be relied upon to choose the most inflammatory response, and this was no exception. When reporters asked him whether he’d attend the funeral of Sarah Beckstrom, the slain West Virginia Guard member, he said he hadn’t thought about it yet and pivoted to extolling his own electoral performance in the state. Later, the president posted a picture of people fleeing Kabul after the U.S. withdrawal (“the horrendous airlift from Afghanistan,” as he put it), and announced that he would “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions.” He also suggested stripping citizenship from immigrants and declared, “Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.”\n\nWhat any of this means in policy terms is unclear, including what specifically Trump means by “Third World,” a term that doesn’t hold practical meaning now that the Cold War distinction of First and Second World countries has dissolved. Mostly, it seems to be a cleaned-up label for what he has previously called “shithole countries”: those whose residents are not white. (The administration has also been working to cut off refugees, except for white South Africans, as well as Europeans who oppose immigration—except, presumably, in their own case.)\n\nTrump was just warming up. On Thanksgiving Day, what began like a normal missive quickly went south. “A very Happy Thanksgiving salutation to all of our Great American Citizens and Patriots who have been so nice in allowing our Country to be divided, disrupted, carved up, murdered, beaten, mugged, and laughed at,” he wrote, before calling Minnesota Governor Tim Walz “seriously retarded” and attacking Representative Ilhan Omar, also of Minnesota, whom he described as “always wrapped in her swaddling hijab” and accused of entering the country illegally. (No evidence supports this.) Trump defended his use of the slur against Walz yesterday.\n\nOn Friday, Trump posted that he was “cancelling all Executive Orders” that President Joe Biden signed using an autopen, a remote-signature device that Trump has also employed. He threatened to try Biden for perjury if he claimed that he’d signed the documents. Again, the actual effects of such a statement are unclear. The most controversial application would be reverting Biden’s pardons and commutations, which Trump has alleged (without proof) that the former president was not aware of authorizing—though legal experts say these types of actions can’t be reversed.\n\nIf any grants of clemency are going to be reversed, a good candidate would be another one of Trump’s actions on Friday: the announcement of a pardon of Juan Orlando Hernández, the former president of Honduras. The floridly corrupt Hernández was sentenced to 45 years in prison last year for conspiring to import cocaine into the United States. Pardoning someone responsible for bringing literal tons of cocaine into the country makes no sense, especially given that Trump’s government is currently using likely illegal strikes to kill people it claims are trafficking small amounts in tiny boats. But Trump’s own experience as a convicted felon has apparently trained him to see convicted heads of state as victims of a political witch hunt. The president also recently commuted the sentence of David Gentile, a financier convicted in a $1.6 billion fraud scheme.\n\nSaturday morning, he posted again, saying that “THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA” should be considered “TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.” Trump has no authority to unilaterally declare a no-fly zone over Venezuela, a sovereign nation with which the U.S. is not (yet!) at war. Even if such a thing were wise, the United States does not appear to be prepared to enforce it: Neither the White House nor the Pentagon has provided any more details or explanations that back up the statement. Never mind: Within 35 minutes, Trump had moved on to claiming to have driven drug prices down “500%, 600%, 700%, and more,” a mathematical impossibility.\n\nIn the most immediate sense, Trump’s rampage worked: He’s back in control of the news cycle. Whether that improves his political position, however, is an open question. Public racism and the use of slurs may be accepted in Trump’s base, and may even excite some of his supporters, but nothing suggests these behaviors will be well liked by the rest of the country, including independents who voted for him in 2024. On Friday, Gallup released a new poll showing Trump at his lowest approval of this term. The president can still seize the spotlight, but notoriety and popularity are not the same thing.\n\nHere are four new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nEvening Read\n\nThe People Outsourcing Their Thinking to AI\n\nBy Lila Shroff\n\nMore From The Atlantic\n\nCulture Break\n\nRemember.

        "text": "Tuesday is a big day for Tennessee, and for the closely divided US House of Representatives. \n\nDemocrats have been vowing to turn red states blue, and last month’s elections gave them some hopeful signs, thanks largely to revved-up urban voters.\n\nThis week a special election in Tennessee’s 7th District, pitting GOP military veteran Matt Van Epps against far-left candidate Aftyn Behn, will show them just how far their base can take them. \n\nGoing by conventional wisdom, this should be a walkover for Van Epps: The district leans Republican by 10 percentage points, and Van Epps’ policy positions echo those of the previous incumbent, former Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July to launch a new business.\n\nBut redistricting in 2020 made the 7th somewhat less rural than it had been, as statehouse Republicans tried to boost the party’s chances elsewhere.\n\nNow it’s anchored by Democrat-dominated Nashville and its suburbs, as well as the wealthy bedroom community of Franklin, one of the richest cities in America — and some recent polling shows Behn within striking distance.\n\nThat makes the race a “canary in the coal mine” for our national politics, says columnist Mark Pulliam.\n\nIt shouldn’t be. \n\nBehn is a former organizer for the George Soros-funded leftist “resistance” group Indivisible, and she has a propensity for saying, and doing, crazy things. \n\nShe has, for example, expressed contempt for Nashville, which she seeks to represent. \n\n“I hate this city,” Behn said in a recently resurfaced video. \n\n“I hate the bachelorettes, I hate the pedal taverns, I hate country music,” she railed. “I hate all the things that make Nashville apparently an ‘It city’ to the rest of the country.”\n\nYou’d think “I hate country music” would be the kiss of death all by itself. (Here in Tennessee, our views on bachelorettes and pedal taverns are more mixed.) \n\nBut that’s just the start of Behn’s bizarre ranting. \n\nShe’s publicly discussed her therapy sessions, and her “recurring dream” of “standing up in a cafeteria full of women . . . and saying ‘I don’t want children. I want power!’ And just screaming it at the top of my lungs.”\n\nWell, you can see why she won the Democratic primary. \n\nShe’s said that women who have children are supporting the “patriarchy,” and has encouraged “self-managed, at-home abortions” in states that ban the procedure. \n\nAnd a 2019 video showed her screaming and sobbing while state troopers dragged her out of Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee’s office after she dashed in without authorization.\n\nWith views and behavior like this in a district that voted for President Donald Trump by 22 percentage points, she should be dead in the water. \n\nBut she’s polling better than she has any right to. And she just might win.\n\nThe reason is that Republican voters in Tennessee, as in many other comfortably red states, are complacent. \n\nThey turn out in big numbers for presidential elections, but in special elections and local elections, they don’t bother. \n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, are insanely angry and motivated, desperate for any kind of a win. \n\nDemographers like to say the future belongs to those who show up. Elections do too.\n\nVotes must be cast to get counted, and listless voters just stay home. \n\nIn low-turnout elections — which special elections usually are — the side demonstrating greater emotional intensity has a better chance of winning. \n\nThat’s definitely Democrats this time around.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tennessee GOP apparatus has appeared as limp as its voters.\n\nThe party has done little to build a turnout operation — something Democrats here have been working very hard at — and seems to think that slamming Behn for her past outrageousness is all it will take to beat her.\n\nThis should sound familiar to New Yorkers. \n\nZohran Mamdani’s socialist, antisemitic statements gave his opponents plenty of ammunition to use against him.\n\nNone of it dampened leftist voter intensity.\n\nNot long ago it would have been unimaginable for New York City to elect a far-left Muslim mayor with open sympathy for terrorist groups after 2,976 people were killed, and thousands more injured, in Islamic terror attacks on the World Trade Center. \n\nBut New Yorkers — at least those who turned out to vote — did just that last month.\n\nLikewise, Tennessee might soon have a congresswoman who will make AOC look like a dignified stateswoman. \n\nWell, we’ll see. Another truism about special elections is that pundits tend to treat them as more significant than they really are. \n\nBut if Democrats do pull off a win this week, it will be a deadly warning to Republicans about the dangers of complacency. \n\nEither way, the scare should be a lesson ahead of next year’s midterms: Play hungry, if you want to win.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds is a professor of law at the University of Tennessee and founder of the InstaPundit.com blog.",

Bernie Sanders on Monday joined striking Starbucks workers in Brooklyn — hours after outgoing Hizzoner Eric Adams unveiled a $39 million settlement for baristas’ lost wages.\n\nSpeaking from the picket line outside a Gowanus Starbucks, Mamdani tied the coffee chain union’s wider strike to his campaign’s — and incoming City Hall’s — focus on affordability and elevating the lives of downtrodden workers.\n\n“Because all of us are united in the belief that we must build in New York where every worker can live a life of decency,” he said. “We must build a New York where our words do not ring hollow. \n\n“As we say that this is a union town, and we must build a New York where the workers who power it are able to afford to live in it.”\n\nThe show of solidarity came as Adams announced the city struck a record-breaking worker protection settlement for 15,000 Starbucks employees who were illegally denied predictable schedules.\n\nThe settlement will give those workers $50 for each week worked from July 4, 2021 to July 7, 2024.\n\n“With this landmark settlement, we’ll put tens of millions of dollars back into the pockets of hard-working New Yorkers and reinforce every New Yorker’s right to a reliable schedule, full hours, and basic dignity,” Adams said in a statement.\n\nBut the settlement only covers past violations in New York City, not the ongoing demands from the union for higher wages, better staffing and improved working hours. \n\nThe strike affects more than 100 stores in nearly as many cities. \n\n“Within the stores, you can see the effects of understaffing and low hours for people,” said Kaari Harsila, 21, a strike captain for the Starbucks Workers United union.\n\n“Once they come back to the table and once they come back to the table to finalize the contract, we will be ready to be done.”\n\nStarbucks CEO Brian Niccol was awarded $96 million in pay after just four months on the job, while many of his workers live paycheck-to-paycheck, Mamdani and Sanders seethed.\n\n“We are living in an economy where the people on top have never, ever had it so good,” Sanders said.",

        "text": "Authored by Scott Pinsker via PJ Media,\n\n\"The more successful the villain, the more successful the picture.\"- Alfred Hitchcock\n\nMAGA needs a new common enemy ASAP. Without one, three things will happen before the end of 2026:\n\nMAGA infighting will escalate. When conservatives lack a common enemy, we cannibalize our own — and that’s gonna be our fate, because the Groyper/Tucker Carlson “purity test” is incompatible with the rest of the MAGA movement. Which means we’ll be clawing at each other’s throats while the Dems cruise to victory.Our trajectory won’t change without a PR change, and right now we’re headed for a 40+ seat blowout in the House. We lost every meaningful race on Election Day 2025; President Trump’s approval rating has dropped to the mid-30s; and by a 2-to-1 margin, more Americans blame Trump for raising prices than give him credit for lowering them. Ignore these warning signs at your own peril.The Democrats — and their sycophants in the media — will set the PR agenda, and their focus will be on affordability (more specifically, Trump’s failure to lower prices). From the mayoral race in the Big Apple to the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, the common denominator for the Dems was affordability. It’s the one issue that worked for far-left radicals, semi-left radicals, and radicals posing as moderates. And if we know anything about the Democrats, we know they simply can’t resist taking a good idea… and running it into the ground.\n\n(Of course, the Dems also take BAD ideas and run ‘em into the ground, too. It’s what they do.)\n\nWas the Biden administration responsible for runaway inflation? You betcha. Do the American people see it that way? No, they don’t.\n\nWe need to change our trajectory, and the quickest way is to cast a new common enemy.\n\nPinsker’s Law of PR #102: When your current trajectory leads to ruin, don’t be an idiot: Change your trajectory!\n\nIf you’re a PJ Media VIP member, this was a topic we discussed yesterday. (And if you’re not a VIP member, shame on you: Our blockbuster Black Friday bonanza ends at midnight.) The question we debated was, “As of today, who’s MAGA’s common enemy?”\n\nDon’t simply say, “It’s the Democrats.” That’s already baked into the cake. In a two-party system, it’s ALWAYS gotta be one or the other.We need more than that.Over the past few decades, Republicans have — temporarily, at least — embraced all kinds of different, far-reaching missions. And each mission had at least one great enemy: There was the Cold War mission (bad guys: Russians, commies, and “useful idiots”). There was the Reagan Revolution mission (bad guys: country club Republicans, RINOs, and non-conservatives). There was the post-9/11 mission (bad guys: radical Islam and/or “the Axis of Evil.”). There was the Tea Party mission (bad guys: government waste, bloat, and debt).Then, of course, came the MAGA mission (bad guys: politicians and policies that put “America Last” instead of “America First”). But the MAGA mission has been around for over 10 years now. Donald Trump has either been running for president — or living in the White House — every day since June 16, 2015. And in some ways, he’s a victim of his success. He’s already closed the border, stopped illegal immigration, and reversed countless “America Last” policies.And today, the globalists are no longer the biggest threat to America’s well-being.\n\nWhich is why, as of Dec. 2025, we’re holding casting calls for MAGA’s next Big Bad. If political marketing is the art of strategic storytelling, then selecting our villain is just as important as choosing our hero, because it’s the villain who sets the stakes.\n\nNot the hero.\n\nStrategic storytelling demands it!\n\n(Or, to quote Doctor Who, “You can always judge a man by the quality of his enemies.”)\n\nAnd the telltale sign of a high-quality political villain is:\n\nThe contrast is clear, dramatic, and easily understood. Ambiguity must be avoided.It’s something that re-unites our side — but stresses the faultlines of our opponents.It’s gotta be based on something real and tangible. (That’s why the radical left’s “Trump is Hitler” PR campaign fell flat: it’s a fake argument.) And the #1 indicator that it’s a real, tangible issue is when the other side takes the bait and argues back on our terms.\n\nThe solution, I believe, is staring us in the face: Donald Trump and the MAGA movement must declare total, absolute political warfare on socialism.\n\nIt’ll re-unite our base. From free market-loving Reagan Republicans to Groypers to MAGA, the threat of a socialist takeover supersedes any disputes over Jews, Zionism, Trump, or tariffs. The ethos of capitalism — and rugged, risk-taking individualism — still resonates across the GOP.\n\nCapitalism vs. socialism is a winning issue for Republicans.\n\nIt’ll fracture the Democratic Party, because not all Democrats want to be socialists. (At least, not yet.) They might want MORE socialism, but they don’t want the government to seize their personal property and “socialize” their industries.\n\n(Especially the corporate kingpins who pull the DNC’s strings. They’re paying big bucks for crony capitalism and sweetheart deals — not a government takeover!)\n\nAnd just as importantly, leftists won’t be able to resist taking the bait. It’s not gonna be like their dopey “Trump is Hitler” PR campaign, where Republicans rolled their eyes and mocked the absurdity of the allegations. \n\nThe socialists in the Democratic Party will 100% engage with us!\n\nI mean… have you ever met a socialist?! Their favorite thing in the whole wide world is arguing about socialism. They WANT To have this debate!\n\nThey’re DESPERATE to have this debate!\n\nZohran Mamdani, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders (and so on) aren’t gonna shake their head and say, “That’s just crazy — we believe in free markets, limited government, and private property, too.”\n\nInstead, the opposite is true: With very little pushing, they’ll make our argument for us.\n\nBesides, socialism is un-American. It’s theft. Socialism necessitates the government takeover of wealth, private property, industry, and opportunity. You don’t own anything; it’s all controlled by the big, powerful government.\n\nBut right now, socialism is ascending. Its popularity is on the rise — mostly because socialism has positioned itself as a solution to the affordability crisis — and the danger is snowballing.\n\nFrom Rasmussen Reports: “Democratic Socialism 2028? Most Young Voters Say ‘Yes’”\n\nA majority of voters under 40 want a democratic socialist to win the White House in the next presidential election.A new national telephone and online survey by Rasmussen Reports and the Glenn C. Haskins Emerging Issues Center of the Heartland Institute finds that 51% of Likely U.S. Voters ages 18 to 39 would like to see a democratic socialist candidate win the 2028 presidential election. Thirty-six percent (36%) don’t want a democratic socialist to win in 2028, while 17% are not sure.\n\nIt’s a helluva storyline: A generational divide! A plot to steal private property! A high-stakes battle for the soul of our country!\n\nThe radical left is on the side of big government. And the only thing standing in their way is Donald Trump, the MAGA movement, and the Republican Party.\n\nPick a side, ladies and gentlemen: Gotta be one or the other.\n\nIt’s the smartest PR pivot that MAGA could make.\n\nThe opinions of the author do not necessarily reflect the views of ZeroHedge.",

They seek fair compensation that enables them to lead a dignified life.”\n\nSanders, a long-time ally of Mamdani, has supported his campaign that centers on populist and worker-oriented policies.\n\nThe union Starbucks Workers United represents over 12,000 baristas across more than 600 locations nationwide.\n\n“Striking Starbucks employees are sending a clear message to this company that they are fed up with corporate greed and union-busting tactics,” Sanders declared on the picket line. “What we witness here is a reflection of a broader movement across the nation. We live in an economy where the wealthy have never had it so good.”\n\nAlso on Monday, Starbucks agreed to pay around $39 million to more than 15,000 New Yorkers to settle claims by the city that the company violated laws requiring it give workers predictable and stable schedules.\n\n“It does not matter how big your business is or how much money your company makes, if you violate our workers’ rights, you will pay the price,” Mayor Adams said in a statement.\n\nSydney West, a Starbucks barista of five years, said employees face long commutes for minimum-wage pay and unpredictable, often short-staffed, working environments.\n\n“We need workable conditions,” she said.\n\nStarbucks did not immediately return a request for comment.",

The Washington Post is definitely in the running for first place with its latest stupidity about inflation.\n\nPost reporter Julie Zauzmer Weil published a piece of propaganda with a headline that defied any modicum of common sense: “Why you may not want lower prices as much as you think you do.”\n\nHer sub-headline was just as bad: “Though Americans might be clamoring for relief on groceries, housing and energy costs, economists say there’s a bigger downside to falling prices.”\n\nImagine being a Post editor with at least a functioning brain agreeing that this insanity was actually going to go over well with the readership. This is just as kooky as when MSNBC tweeted out November 8, 2021, that the spiking inflation running amok under President Joe Biden was “a good thing.”\n\nBut Weil couldn’t be stopped. She spent 1,456 words worth of column inches attempting to make this lunacy somehow make a lick of sense. Despite her own admission that prices across a litany of sectors soared a whopping 25 percent over the last five years, Weil then basically just told American consumers to deal with it: “The problem is, there’s generally no going back once prices rise. And for good reason.” She then distorted the dismal science of economics to cast falling prices as a de facto indicator of recession: “Ironically, falling prices can both signal a recession and trigger one.”\n\nHere’s the glaring problem with that logic. Deflation, as Investopedia explained, could actually be considered a “good thing” for “most of the time.” In fact, with prices as exorbitantly high as they are, a general decrease “gives consumers greater purchasing power.” Aside from price drops from food and energy volatility, which Weil conceded were welcome exceptions, Investopedia further contextualized that “a general, persistent fall in all prices not only allows people to consume more but can promote economic growth and stability by enhancing the function of money as a store of value and encouraging real saving.” \n\nEven the National Bureau of Economic Research wrote in a paper published 2004 that there’s much more nuance to deflation than what Weil let on. “Good deflation, they maintain, occurs when aggregate supply of goods (say from technological advances, improved productivity, and the like) increases faster than aggregate demand, resulting in falling prices,” NBER noted. “Bad deflation in turn occurs when aggregate demand falls faster than any growth in aggregate supply.” NBER even concluded then that “These economists find that, contrary to conventional wisdom, deflation may well be more positive than negative.” \n\nYou wouldn’t know any of this nuance reading Weil’s nutty piece painting a broad, negative stroke across a decrease in prices writ large. Instead, she simply conjectured that “If wages stay high but the price of goods fall, companies won’t make enough profit to pay their employees.” She even cited Columbia Business School Professor Laura Veldkamp to take her fringe theory a step further by suggesting that “even the expectation of lower prices can trigger a recession.”\n\nHow dare Americans not want to pay the price of a new car for a used one! Are we getting that right, Weil? Veldkamp reportedly told Weil that “‘“Price declines are typically associated with really severe negative outcomes,’” which in light of Investopedia’s context clearly shows this is not necessarily true. Mises Institute Associate Scholar Frank Shostak even wrote in January that “Contrary to such thinking, deflation, which is manifested by declining prices, is the mechanism that makes a great variety of goods produced more accessible to individuals.”\n\nSo what exactly would work to compensate for this dilemma, eh Weil? Well, she gave one suggestion: government price controls. Yes, you read that right: \n\n[Moody’s Analytics economist Matt] Colyar said he thinks government policy could reduce prices in two major areas: housing and health care. The government is heavily involved in health care and could pursue policies that reduce costs.\n\nSo the solution is the government once again sticking its grubby hands to control the means of production. Now where have we heard that hammer and sickle idea before? Weil continued to go down that cesspool, and even puffed up communist New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s economy-wrecking government tax and spend policies:\n\nSome left-leaning activists who have been blaming Trump for high prices acknowledge he can’t return prices to pre-pandemic levels. Instead, while acknowledging the risks that government spending can itself juice inflation, some envision a government that covers more of the costs with which families are struggling. Zohran Mamdani won the New York mayoral race on a platform that calls for subsidizing child care, freezing rent and making public transit free.\n\nHoly smokes. It’s like watching a train wreck happen in real time.",

But the last four years have been hard. We've seen the dollar slice go extinct, storefront after storefront close, and had a mayor in Eric Adams who has ignored the struggles of small businesses.\"\n\nAs Mayor, Mamdani is vowing to \"make it faster, easier, and cheaper for small businesses to get started and stay open.\"\n\n\"First, we're going to cut fines and fees for small businesses by 50 percent,\" Mamdani continues. \"Regulations are but small businesses have to navigate more than 6,000 of them with far fewer resources than the big chains.\"\n\nSo far, so good, right? Well, then the other shoe drops.\n\n\"That's why, as mayor, I'll appoint a Mom & Pop Czar with a clear goal of making it easier to run a small business,\" Mamdani adds.\n\nThere it is. More government.\n\n\"Next, we're going to accelerate permits and applications. The Mom & Pop Czar will coordinate with agencies to speed up turnaround times, cut red tape, and let New Yorkers start businesses sooner,\" Mamdani says. \"Because you shouldn't have to fill out 24 forms and go through seven agencies to start a barbershop.\"\n\n\"But most of all, we're putting our money where our mouth is,\" Mamdani continues, \"by increasing funding for small business support programs by 500 percent. We're going to invest $20 million in our Business Express Service Teams, which pairs small businesses with a city case manager that helps them navigate permits and regulations, as well as connecting them with programs that provide them with financial and legal assistance.\"\n\n\"Right now,\" Mamdani says, \"only three percent of businesses are using these programs. We want that number to skyrocket. The only thing more New York than an egg and cheese are the small businesses that make them.\"\n\nSome are very skeptical of this plan.\n\nSo your plan is to create another government agency headed by a small business \"czar\" who will have a team of politically appointed government workers who can help selected small businesses get tax payer money, avoid red tape & not pay fines? This has corruption written all over…— Izengabe (@Izengabe_) December 1, 2025\n\n\"This has corruption written all over it,\" the user noted.\n\nWe have to assume DEI and woke progressive politics will play a role in which businesses get a boost and which ones don't.\n\nHow very capitalist of you.What do your comrades at the DSA think about this?— Skeptical Stoic (@StoicSkeptical) November 30, 2025\n\nThey can't be happy about a lot of this, can they?\n\nthey won't have to worry about being in business anymore either— futwick (@harshyourmellow) December 1, 2025\n\nBodega owners warned that Mamdani's plan for government-run grocery stores would drive them all out of business.\n\nDoes that include all small businesses?

Established businesses didn’t have that luxury, but now Mamdani is increasing startup cash for “new businesses” (whose businesses?) and removing regulations or waving fines for things that I’m guessing these extremely un-assimilated demographics would have no ability to do, much less interest in doing. Cleanliness standards, worker hygiene standards, temperature control/food safety, inspections, record-keeping…something tells me that Mamdani isn’t rugpulling his Marxist base. He’s rewarding it. Because Marxism is not an ideology to people with no intellectual history. It means “free stuff and doing whatever I want.” That’s why the foreign-born population elected him mayor and that’s what he’s doing here. The absolutely last thing you need is less oversight and regulation of people who are navigating civilization for the first time.\n\nI'm actually shocked by the number of people falling for this who think Zohran is doing this because he's pragmatic or thoughtful and not because 90+% of small businesses in New York are run by Muslims (not even an exaggeration) https://t.co/YFau4rAetH— Future Moldovan Citizen (@MainstreamViews) November 30, 2025\n\nAlso a very valid point.\n\nWe'll see how this plays out.",

Council member Janeese Lewis George, a self-avowed democratic socialist, announced Monday she will run to lead the nation’s capital in 2026.\n\nLewis George, 37, is a lifelong Washingtonian who has represented the District’s 4th Ward, since 2021. According to an announcement video she posted to X Monday morning, her campaign is set to focus on cost-of-living issues and strengthening public services — a platform bearing striking similarities to that of New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who also describes himself as a democratic socialist. (RELATED: DC Mayor Muriel Bowser Passes On Run For 4th Term)\n\nLewis George launching her mayoral bid makes her the first candidate to jump into the race since Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser — who has served as mayor since 2015 — announced she would not run for a fourth term.\n\n“I ran for D.C. Council because I was sick of the status quo, tired of watching politicians make plans that left the rest of us out,” Lewis George said in her campaign launch video. “Rent’s rising in homes people can’t afford, folks working hard and still feeling the squeeze, while few in power rake in profits.”\n\nLewis George has been strongly opposed to Bowser’s handling of President Donald Trump’s temporary federal takeover of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), saying D.C. leadership is “failing to stand up” to the president’s administration.\n\n“It’s time we had leaders who fight for the people, who stand up to corruption and greed, and stand with the people who make D.C. work,” Lewis George said in her campaign announcement.\n\nThe left-wing lawmaker has also bucked against her moderate colleagues in the past, urging her colleagues to move further to the left by refusing to support certain legislation until she has secured amendments for her preferred policies, according to the Washington Post (WaPo).\n\nFor example, Lewis George voted for the $3.7 billion deal to rebuild RFK stadium only after she secured a deal with the Washington Commanders to broaden union protections for workers, the WaPo reported.\n\nLewis George in 2024 voted for a crime bill that strengthened gun penalties following her successful pushback against a provision that would have lowered the required amount of money needed for theft to be prosecuted as a felony, according to the WaPo.\n\nDuring her last reelection campaign, Lewis George’s opponents criticized her for being soft on crime. During her first successful campaign for City Council in 2020, the socialist walked back past comments about defunding the police. She emphasized her past experience as D.C. Assistant Attorney General in her campaign video, saying she “fought to get justice for crime victims.”\n\nShe told the WaPo in an interview published Monday that she would focus on “evidence-based strategies” to prevent crime and quickly prosecute lawbreakers as opposed to handing them longer sentences. She also said she supports hiring more police to decrease the department’s overtime usage and update officers’ facilities to boost morale.\n\nIn addition to Mamdani’s Nov. 4 win, fellow socialist Katie Wilson also won her race that month to become Seattle’s mayor-elect. Meanwhile, socialist Omar Fateh came up short in his bid to unseat Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.\n\nA spokesperson for Lewis George did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

        "text": "Public school districts have a responsibility to educate students, safeguard taxpayer money, and provide families with opportunities for success. However, Chicago Public Schools (CPS) has become a national example of how a school system collapses under mismanagement, political patronage, and an absence of accountability.\n\nA report from the Chicago Board of Education's Office of Inspector General uncovered $23.6 million in misused spending—specifically, spending on lavish and often unapproved travel: $1,000-a-night hotel rooms, airport limos, luxury suites, and \"professional development\" trips that doubled as vacations. One teacher stretched a four-day seminar into a weeklong Hawaiian resort stay costing $4,700.\n\nA principal booked a Las Vegas Strip suite for an anniversary celebration and extended the trip without authorization. In another incident, 24 employees from one school spent $50,000 to attend a Las Vegas conference. More than $142,000 was spent on overseas trips to South Africa, Finland, Estonia, and Egypt—complete with hot-air balloon rides and game-park safaris.\n\nThe abuses skyrocketed further when federal pandemic funds loosened district budgets. Of the $23.6 million, $14.5 million was spent in 2023 and 2024 alone. These dollars were intended to address severe learning loss after the Chicago Teachers Union forced schools to remain closed for 78 weeks during the pandemic. Instead of supporting students' academic recovery, millions became a travel fund.\n\nThat level of waste is why students like me need school choice. When a district spends public money this irresponsibly while failing to educate its students, families deserve the freedom to go elsewhere.\n\nMeanwhile, only two in five CPS students read at grade level, and barely one in four meets math expectations. In some neighborhoods, proficiency falls into the single digits. Nearly 45 percent of students—and more than half of high schoolers—are chronically absent. These figures reflect a district that has walked away from its obligation to prepare young people for the workforce, higher education, and civic life.\n\nChronic absenteeism and low achievement correlate closely with higher rates of youth crime. Chicago's public-safety challenges cannot be separated from the fact that tens of thousands of teenagers are disconnected from school. No city with these levels of absenteeism and academic collapse can expect improvements in long-term safety.\n\nThis pattern of misused funds and misplaced priorities is not limited to Chicago. New York lawmakers continue to steer resources away from academics and toward politically acceptable initiatives. \n\nIn New York's 2025 \"People's Budget,\" Democrats—including Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who was serving in the Assembly at the time—proposed an $8 million initiative to \"increase teacher diversity\" through new recruitment and training programs. Yet New York City's teaching workforce is already about 42 percent black, nearly double the city's black population share of roughly 22 percent.\n\nThe same budget allocates $250,000 for \"racial and cultural inclusivity\" initiatives, $3 million for an Adirondack exhibit on African American history, and over $350,000 for statewide conventions for \"underrepresented\" educators. \n\nMeanwhile, NYC public schools serve 154,000 homeless students, and nearly half of the students statewide cannot meet basic reading benchmarks. New York spends more than $39,000 per pupil—the highest amount in the country—yet academic outcomes continue to fall.\n\nIf the problem were money, New York would be leading the nation. But this is a crisis of priorities.\n\nCharter schools offer a proven alternative that disrupts the cycle of low achievement and disengagement. Unlike traditional public schools, charter schools provide students with 30 percent to 50 percent more instructional time. This extra time correlates directly with stronger academic performance and higher rates of student engagement.\n\nA study found that entering a North Carolina charter school in ninth grade was associated with a roughly 30 percent reduction in a student's likelihood of committing a crime compared with students in traditional public schools. Research from Milwaukee's voucher program found that students in choice programs were significantly less likely to commit crimes as young adults.\n\nSchool choice gives students in failing districts an exit ramp. Programs in Florida, Arizona, and North Carolina show that scholarship and charter systems can coexist with public schools and often improve them through competition.\n\nChicago's waste, New York's misplaced priorities, and the falling academic performance nationwide all point to the same conclusion: Families—not bureaucracies—should decide where and how children are educated.",

        "text": "Reason has a rule against starting essays with quotes from Friedrich Hayek. After all, one could start nearly every essay in this magazine with a bon mot from the Austrian-born economist and classical liberal hero. But sometimes things get bad enough that only a Hayek quote will do.\n\nIn this month's cover story, where Eric Boehm documents how the GOP has been slouching toward socialism, he kicks\nthings off with Hayek's warning that economic nationalism can be \"the bridge from conservatism to collectivism\" and that thinking in terms of \"our\" industries is only a short step from demanding that they be \"directed in the national interest.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's second-term \"national champion\" economic strategy has metastasized from tariffs and jawboning to direct control: a golden share in U.S. Steel and government equity stakes in Intel, MP Materials, Lithium Americas, and Trilogy Metals. No longer veiling every power grab under the guise of responding to an emergency, he is presenting these as necessary for national security and other ongoing\nnational interests. The result, Boehm argues, will be more state control of the commanding heights, and that will invite politicized decision making, bad bets, and the well-documented underperformance that tends to follow when the state takes seats in corporate boardrooms.\n\nIs this socialism? The word was chosen advisedly. What Trump is doing is more akin to state capitalism, for now. You might even consider whether the term fascism applies, if you want to pick a fight rather than change minds.\n\nBut once upon a time, Republicans were at least moderately chastened by accusations that their policies resembled socialism in any way. For at least a couple of decades, a staple among the conservative chattering classes was to lament that the kids these days keep telling pollsters they prefer socialism to capitalism. They're still doing it: In an October Axios–Generation Lab poll of college students, 67 percent hold a positive or neutral association with the word socialism, compared with 40 percent with the word capitalism.\n\nThis political moment is captured perfectly in Hayek's dedication of The Road to Serfdom: \"To the socialists of all parties.\" As Reason goes to press with an issue accusing the GOP of socialist tendencies, a self-described socialist has just been elected mayor of New York City. Zohran Mamdani ran on a platform of rent freezes, higher minimum wages, free buses, new taxes on the wealthy, and city-run grocery stores. The BBC, covering Mamdani's successful campaign, noted that democratic socialism \"has no clear definition\"—fair enough—but then preposterously went on to say that it \"essentially means giving a voice to workers, not corporations.\"\n\nBoth in New York and in Washington, D.C., officials are still just taking baby steps toward state control of the economy. But baby steps in the wrong direction add up, especially when they build new precedents for government ownership as a routine policy tool rather than a last-ditch response to crisis.\n\nWhen a government marries price\ncontrols, nationalizations, and an ever-expanding definition of \"strategic\" sectors, the end state is neither abundance nor resilience. Venezuela's long slide—from petro-prosperity to hyperinflation, capital\nflight, shortages, and political repression—wasn't caused by just one statute or one charismatic leader, but by a theory that essential industries must be steered from the center of political power. That theory eventually consumes everything it touches, including the price mechanism, the independence of firms, and the credibility of money.\n\nWhen Hayek referred to socialism, he meant state control of the economy, not the welfare state in its many guises. (Though it is worth noting that both major parties have campaigned upon pledges not to cut, reform, or otherwise bring reasonable fiscal alignment to the largest entitlement programs.) On that narrower definition, the United States in 2025 is far from true socialism.\n\nIt is, however, troublingly closer than it once was. The habit of using state power to override market choices is growing on both left and right. Republicans increasingly justify industrial policy as a national security imperative; Democrats often insist on \"public options\" across sectors. In both cases, the mechanism is the same: Redefine \"our\" interests so broadly that almost any private decision becomes a public question.\n\nThis is where the GOP's new enthusiasm for equity stakes should alarm anyone who ever identified as a fan of the free market. If Washington owns a golden share, a firm's governance documents start to read like an executive branch wish list. If Washington owns 10 percent of a chipmaker, the political incentives point toward doubling down when the bet goes bad, not exiting and taking the loss. The more the state identifies with \"national champions,\" the more capital and attention flow toward the politically connected rather than the productive. If we aren't yet on the road to serfdom, perhaps we're pulling up to the highway on-ramp.\n\nMeanwhile in New York, the new mayor's platform highlights a different risk: the soft normalization of municipal ownership and price-setting as first-resort tools for meeting affordability goals. Even Mamdani's admirers concede that many of his ideas will run headlong into state law, institutional veto points, and budget arithmetic. That is an argument not just about feasibility but about humility. Should a city government that struggles to maintain buses on schedule try to operate grocery logistics at scale? Should it even be operating buses? As Mamdani went from long-shot candidate to frontrunner, the more ideologically edgy elements of his platform started to rapidly fall away. But counting on him to keep scaling back bad ideas is too dangerous a gamble for America's\nbiggest city.\n\nWhether the pretext is \"national security\" or \"affordability,\" the method is the same: replacing voluntary exchange with political allocation. Since we're already indulging ourselves, let's let Hayek have the last word: \"The effect of the people's agreeing that there must be central planning, without agreeing on the ends, will be rather as if a group of people were to commit themselves to take a journey together without agreeing where they want to go; with the result that they may all have to make a journey which most of them do not want at all.\"",

Andrew Cuomo. The Republican strategist predicted that the passion of the socialist wing of the Democratic Party would be unbeatable. (RELATED: Mamdani-Loving Queer Socialist Primaries Hakeem Jeffries)\n\n“[T]hat’s where their energy is. It’s obvious. It’ll be shocking to me if they don’t nominate a socialist for president in 2028,” Jennings said. “They fought it off in ’16. They fought it off in ’20. They’re not going to fight it off in 2028.”\n\nManhattan Institute President Reihan Salam told Jennings he believed Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear would win the nomination and be “flanked by socialist advisers.”\n\n“I don’t know about that. I think someone has to be able to channel the emotional energy … You have to be able to absorb and reflect the emotional energy of the electorate,” Jennings replied. “That’s what [President Donald] Trump got about the Republicans in ’16 that none of the other 17 got. It’s what Trump got about the country last year. It’s what Mamdani, I guess, got about, you know, enough people here in New York. You have to be able to absorb and reflect the emotional energy of enough people to win.”\n\n“And it requires a bit of showmanship. It doesn’t require advisers. It requires a bit of personal talent and showmanship. That’s part of the game now. And so my impression is it’ll be somebody like that,” he added. “It won’t be a milquetoast person going, ‘Well, but I’ve got a whole politburo here that’ll help me.’ It’ll be somebody who can personally understand the energy and reflect it back.”\n\nJennings said it would be difficult for Beshear to compete with a socialist candidate.\n\n“He’ll have a hard time, I think, competing with people who are more authentically radical anti-American socialists. But that’s what the Democrats want,” he said. “They want somebody who thinks America’s rotten at the core. They want somebody who thinks capitalism has failed. And they want somebody who’d like to rip all of it out and install some other very un-American ideology. Beshear, I think, would have a hard time keeping up with the emotional energy of that.”\n\nIndependent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ran for president as a Democrat in 2016 and 2020. He asserted on “Flagrant” in May that both of his campaigns faced “hatred” from the “Democratic establishment.”\n\n“[T]he establishment did not want to open the door. They hated the idea for all these people whose hands were a little bit dirty, who didn’t have PhDs or weren’t wealthy — imagine walking in: ‘It’s my party, man. You ain’t getting in. We will fight you in the most ruthless ways that we can.’ And that’s the struggle,” Sanders said. “Are they gonna open the door, or are they prepared to lose elections, literally, and … go down with the Titanic?”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

        "text": "Authored by Naveen Athrappully via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),\n\nAn American retail worker earns 51.6 percent less than the amount required to afford a typical rental apartment, real estate brokerage Redfin said in a statement released on Nov. 26.\n\n“The typical retail worker in America earns $34,436 per year,” the company said.\n\n“A renter would need to earn $71,172 to afford the typical apartment, which costs $1,779 per month.”\n\nThis signifies a shortfall of $36,736 needed to afford an apartment, even though overall affordability has improved slightly in recent years.\n\nIn Cleveland, a typical retail worker earns 32.9 percent less than needed to afford a residence, the smallest shortfall among 40 metropolitan areas analyzed by the brokerage. This was followed by St. Louis, San Antonio, Kansas City, and Milwaukee. These places have some of the lowest rents in the country.\n\nIn contrast, the shortfall was highest in New York, where a retail worker earned 71 percent less. This was followed by Boston, San Jose, Miami, and San Diego. These locations rank among the most expensive rental locations.\n\nBesides the rent struggle, the U.S. retail sector is also seeing large layoffs.\n\nRetailers have announced 88,664 job cuts through October this year, a 145 percent jump compared to the same period last year, according to a Nov. 6 report by outplacement company Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\n\nIncomes and Rent Growth\n\n“As the cost of living has increased, so have the sacrifices renters must make to afford a place to live,” Redfin Chief Economist Daryl Fairweather said.\n\nHowever, “the good news is rents are no longer rising as fast as they were during the pandemic, so rental affordability has actually improved slightly in recent years,” Fairweather added.\n\nThe average rent in a primary city residence grew by almost 3.4 percent between September 2024 and 2025, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\n\nA Nov. 19 report from real estate marketplace Zillow noted that U.S. incomes grew faster than asking rents this year amid a general slowdown in rent growth.\n\n“Affordability is improving most significantly in markets where rents have fallen from year-ago levels, including Austin (where the typical asking rent is down 3.1 percent annually), Denver (-2.1 percent), San Antonio (-0.8 percent), and Phoenix (-0.7 percent),” the report said.\n\n“Though incomes have understandably outpaced rents in markets where rent growth has turned negative, affordability improvements have even reached metros where rent growth remains strong.”\n\nA monthly rental budget of $2,000 will net different types of properties based on the region, according to a Nov. 10 report from online rental marketplace Apartments.\n\n“Renters in smaller cities like Memphis, Buffalo, and Indianapolis can afford three-bedroom apartments within a $2,000 budget, while in big cities like Boston, Los Angeles, and Seattle, that same budget often only covers a studio,” it said.\n\nMeanwhile, there have been proposals to freeze the amount that can be charged on rental properties.\n\nZohran Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist who won the New York City mayoral race this month, proposed a rent freeze during his campaign. Washington state, Oregon, and California have already implemented statewide rent control.\n\nSupporters of rent-freeze policies argue that such measures are required to ease the burden on American families. However, critics warn that pursuing these policies could deter investment in the rental market, further exacerbating the issue in the long run.\n\nA survey of The Epoch Times readers conducted on Oct. 29 found that most opposed rent-freeze measures and advocated pursuing market solutions.\n\nNearly 40 percent suggested that builders cut costs to reduce the housing shortage, which could then bring down rents.",

We’re talking about the long-simmering controversy on Today in Ohio.\n\nEditor Chris Quinn hosts our daily half-hour news podcast, with editorial board member Lisa Garvin, impact editor Leila Atassi and content director Laura Johnston.\n\nYou’ve been sending Chris lots of thoughts and suggestions on our from-the-newsroom text account, in which he shares what we’re thinking about at cleveland.com.

They’d like to see the nickel go away, too. But reporter Anna Staver found some business people for whom the end of the penny could be a big deal. Why?\n\nCleveland has its own verson of Zohran Mamdani. Who is it?\n\nWith shootings scaring people at two county fairs over the summer and hooliganism showing up at plenty of other gatherings, Cleveland had some strict rules for its Winterland kickoff in Public Square. What did the city do, and how did it work out?\n\nWe were stunned at how shabbily Cuyahoga County Executive Chris Ronayne was treating MetroHealth throughout the budget process, first taking steps that ended up shutting down the psychiatric emergency room and then slashing the county subsidy. Did county council members have a greater sense of their responsibility to this vital institution?\n\nThis seems like a surprise, given the conservation efforts of recent years, but how much has plastic pollution in Lake Erie gone up in the past decade?\n\nIs it really all that surprising that JD Vance could not name the eight presidents who came from Ohio? Could any of us? Why is it that they are so obscure?\n\nThis is one of those stories that I guess has been flying under the radar for years. Where has a big Muslic community emerged in Northeast Ohio, and what are the plans to fortify the community there?\n\nWe have an Apple podcasts channel exclusively for this podcast.

We got some news to talk about though, before we get there. It’s Today in Ohio, the news podcast discussion from cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer. I’m Chris Quinn here with Laura Johnston, Lisa Garvin, and back from two weeks off, Leila Tasi. Remember Leila? I should reintroduce you to Leila. Leila, you’re up first.\n\nWith all the fussing and fighting and all kinds of kind of illegal shenanigans in the state house over it, does it turn out that traffic is actually not bad enough to merit a new highway interchange in Strongsville?\n\nLeila (00:41.336)\n\nTurns out maybe not, Chris. The early numbers from this big two-year NAWACA study of the I-71 corridor show that traffic in Strongsville and Brunswick is nowhere near the disaster that some lawmakers made it out to be. The engineers actually said they were surprised. Traffic is, quote, not terrible. Even after they checked the cameras, they sent up drones, they literally flew a helicopter over the mess just to be sure.\n\nAnd yeah, there are pinch points, mostly around South Park Mall and a few busy intersections and garbage truck day on Howe Road is apparently its own special kind of chaos. But overall, nothing is failing today. And even looking ahead to 2050, only a few intersections slip into that, know, uh-oh territory. And that’s important because the whole reason we’re doing the study is the fight over whether to build this brand new interchange at Boston Road. Strongsville has long wanted it.\n\nBrunswick has long said hard pass. Lawmakers have tried sneaking the interchange into the state budget more than once, only to have it yanked back out after a public backlash. Now with actual data on the table, Brunswick officials are basically saying, see, we told you so. Strongsville’s mayor is still pushing for solutions, especially for emergency vehicles. But even he admits people might accept an alternative if the study offers one. So I think the takeaway is that after all this drama,\n\nThe early evidence says traffic just isn’t bad enough to justify a brand new interchange, at least not yet.\n\nChris Quinn (02:12.077)\n\nWell, this story floored me because they have made it sound like this is Armageddon for traffic. And when you talk about pinch points, have you ever been on 271 heading south during the afternoon rush hour? I mean, you have pinch points everywhere in Northeast Ohio during rush hour and bad traffic periods. You learn if you can to avoid it. And if you can’t, you get stuck in it. This doesn’t sound like it’s anything worse.\n\nthan many of the areas that we encounter on any day. just, what brought this to the fever pitch that they so desperately wanted this intersection because the traffic clearly doesn’t justify it.\n\nLisa Garvin (02:50.662)\n\nLeila (02:53.934)\n\nYeah, I don’t know. mean, I think the study still has 13 months to go, but yeah, the crisis that they described doesn’t show up in the numbers. I think it’s fascinating that the data is forcing a reality check on this debate that’s been driven by politics. Let’s be honest, that’s what’s really behind this. If the numbers continue to show that congestion isn’t the monster it’s been made out to be, then they really need to kind of shift the conversation from where do we build a new interchange to how do we make the system we already have work?\n\nLisa Garvin (03:03.622)\n\nthat’s the reality that number two, the patient’s needs have been driven by common sense. But to be honest, that’s really kind of, the numbers continue to show that suggestion isn’t a loss, it’s a loss. But they really need to kind of shift the conversation around. Where do we build community? How do we make the system here better place? That might be what we need to be talking about as well.\n\nLeila (03:23.79)\n\nmean, that might be what we need to be talking about in Strongsville. And that will open the door to cheaper, faster fixes. You’ll get signal timing, turn lane tweaks, stuff like that. Coordinating with delivery trucks. There are ways to make it easier on residents and people who are regularly driving that.\n\nChris Quinn (03:34.765)\n\nChris Quinn (03:41.325)\n\nYeah, but hold on. I mean, we’re supposed to base our traffic spending on priorities. And I think based on the way this sounds, my bet is if you looked at all of the traffic areas that are problematic in Northeast Ohio, this wouldn’t rank that high. I Lisa, you drive around in the daytime, don’t you hit pinch points?\n\nLisa Garvin (04:00.13)\n\nMm-hmm. Yeah, all over the place. I mean, east side, west side, south side, they’re just kind of all over the place.\n\nChris Quinn (04:03.22)\n\nChris Quinn (04:08.459)\n\nI mean, I don’t think that the loudest screaming should result in the fastest spending. I think we should look at the region as a whole, which is the whole point of NOACA. Where is traffic the worst? And that’s where you spend the money. And if this study shows that these people are just whining, it’s not that bad, then I don’t think we should be spending any money there. Maybe change their garbage day or something.\n\nLeila (04:29.728)\n\nI think, well, I think that we should applaud the fact that the system so far has worked in this case, because look at how hard they tried to move this project to the front of the queue and get it done and just ram it through when finally we’re seeing some data that doesn’t support the necessity for it. So hooray, we haven’t wasted public money on something that was unnecessary.\n\nChris Quinn (04:53.633)\n\nExcept we came very close. I Patton put in the law, which was pretty much not even legal because you have to work with the federal government on stuff like this. there were a bunch of shenanigans involved in this that brought this to a head. Look, did anybody expect that this study would come back and say what it shows so far? Not a chance. No, because of all the squawking. So you’re right. It’s good that we have some real data. Great story. just it floored me.\n\nLeila (04:58.884)\n\nLeila (05:16.611)\n\nChris Quinn (05:26.509)\n\nYou’re listening to Today in Ohio. We’ve had several conversations of late about how regulators finally held first energy accountable and wouldn’t give them the money that they kept trying to pull out of our pockets. So Laura, I was surprised by this story. Why are rates for first energy customers going up while they’re decreasing for electricity customers elsewhere in Ohio?\n\nLaura (05:48.462)\n\nWell, and it’s not even all First Energy customers. So First Energy has three Ohio subsidiaries. Only one, thank you, Northeast Ohio, is going to see the base electric rates go up by about $5 per month for the average residential user. Ohio Edison and Toledo Edison will actually have their base rates go down by a few dollars per month. So it’s just the illuminating customers that are going to see an increase. And these base rates have been in place for as long as, I believe,\n\nfour years, they’re just one component that affect the power bills. Obviously, we’ve got to deal with spiking electricity prices and all of the usage. But this is from the PUCO ruling. It’s a compromise. Actually, the Ohio Consumers Council wanted First Energy to slash its annual rates by more than $132 million. First Energy, meanwhile, wanted to collect $190 million more per year. It wanted a profit margin of 10.8%, which I read that I just wanted to like.\n\nshoot a dart at somebody. And the PUCO said, no, 9.63 % is what you’re going to get. And the reason that the illuminating company customers, us, are seeing this base rate increase is because the cost of maintaining the electricity grid in Northeast Ohio is more expensive than elsewhere and not what they anticipated, maybe because they didn’t use their grid modernization fee to actually modernize the grid, which is what we were talking about recently on the podcast.\n\nChris Quinn (07:14.477)\n\nYeah, I did hear from some of the listeners and others who read the podcast story about that. And while they don’t trust First Energy to actually spend the money to fix up the grid, they do wish that some independent agency that the state could monitor could come in and spend that money on the grid. They really don’t want the money back. They want reliable power systems. And if this is the reason we have higher rates, all the more reason to fix the grid.\n\nLaura (07:34.688)\n\nLaura (07:42.092)\n\nChris Quinn (07:42.731)\n\nI wish First Energy would be forced to divest itself so that we could get some kind of responsible owner of that system in so that we would stop talking about these nightmares.\n\nLaura (07:53.742)\n\nYeah, you know what I was floored by in this story was that the PUCL also blocked First Energy from continuing to earn profits on their tree trimming and line clearing work. So I guess between 2007 and 2021, they had nearly $270 million of that work. And then they charged customers an extra fee on top of that. They’re not doing the work themselves. They’re paying for someone to do it. But they took an upcharge for that. And so\n\nThis is vegetation management with a profit and the PUC, was saying, you actually cannot do that. And that to me is just galling that they were paying somebody to do the work they should have been doing and then charging us extra on top of what they were paying.\n\nChris Quinn (08:33.739)\n\nYeah, we’ll pay what it costs, but you shouldn’t make extra money on it because you’ve allowed your system to become so overgrown. They had not been good about trimming trees. That’s one of the reasons we had the blackout back in the day. And now to hear they’re trying to make a profit on it boggles the mind. They just are thieves. Any way they can nickel and dime us.\n\nLaura (08:36.556)\n\nLaura (08:48.759)\n\nChris Quinn (08:58.049)\n\nThey do instead of running a responsible utility. And yet they’ll tell you today, we’re not the same utility that bribe the state house into oblivion. We’re a better company today. When are we going to see a sign of that?\n\nLaura (09:03.735)\n\nLaura (09:09.623)\n\nI don’t know.\n\nChris Quinn (09:11.019)\n\nYou’re listening to Today in Ohio. Most of the readers who wrote to me say they don’t care about the end of the penny and they’d actually like to see the nickel go away too. But Lisa reporter Anna Staver found some business people who think the end of the penny could be a big deal for them. Why?\n\nLisa Garvin (09:14.342)\n\nLisa Garvin (09:28.3)\n\nIt’s already starting to be a big deal. You know, the last penny rolled out of the mint on November 12th and it was kind of sudden. They usually phase out currency over years, but there are no federal or state rules on rounding purchases to the nearest nickel. Many businesses are already running short. I was in a Goodwill yesterday. They were putting up signs saying we don’t have pennies. And the question is, do you round up or down?\n\nSo the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond in July in their economic brief suggested a common rounding rule. So totals that end in three, four, eight or nine cents are rounded up. Totals ending in one, two, six or seven get rounded down. But a Federal Reserve study found that rounding usually isn’t in the customer’s favor and it costs consumers $6 million a year. So in the Federal Reserve study 2024 purchases, they found that\n\nIn America, 14 % of people paid cash last year. Big variances by age. If you’re 55 or over, it was 19 % paying cash. If you’re 18 to 24, only 10 % were paying cash. So this is already a mess. We talked to the president of the Ohio Restaurant and Hospitality Alliance, John Barker. He says it’s a real mess. He says most people are uncomfortable with rounding up without a law.\n\nbut he rounding down could be a significant business loss. And then what happens to the extra pennies? There’s no guidance on taxing it, tracking it, or you know, it’s profit. Is it getting pocketed? Where does it go?\n\nChris Quinn (11:01.293)\n\nI’m surprised that this is this much of a hardship because the most they can round up your purchase is going to be four cents, right? Because otherwise you’re at the nickel level and given how much inflation is devalued currency, are people really going to be hurt by a four cent roundup?\n\nLisa Garvin (11:23.91)\n\nI say yes, pennies add up and you know, think that’s extra profit that they don’t have to track a report at this point. You know, so if you take three or four pennies from 100 customers a day, that’s a lot of money.\n\nChris Quinn (11:38.027)\n\nWell, think about if they follow through with the nickel, which they can make a financial argument for that will really turn things upside down. You’re listening to Today in Ohio. All right, Laila Cleveland has its own version of Zoran Mamdani. Who is it?\n\nLeila (11:55.139)\n\nThe answer is Tanmay Shah in Ward 12. He just pulled off exactly the kind of upset that Mamdani became famous for in New York City. Two years ago, Shah stood at the Cleveland City Council podium and basically told Blaine Griffin and the city’s power brokers, go ahead and collect your checks from billionaires. We’re coming for you and you can’t stop us. finally, after every last provisional and mail ballot was tallied, he proved it.\n\nHe beat incumbent Danny Kelly by nine votes. Nine votes. That’s about as slim as it gets. Shaw is a 29-year-old democratic socialist. He’s a former legal aid attorney who quit his job to drive trucks part-time so he could spend the rest of his time organizing. He built his entire campaign around the idea that City Hall isn’t listening. They’re not listening on housing, not on basic services. And he ran the most left-leaning tenant-focused platform in the entire field.\n\nand he mailed out guides on how renters can fight late fees and force repairs. He hammered affordability and he rode that grassroots energy all the way to victory. And what makes this even more mumdani-esque, I guess you could say, is who he beat. He beat a union-backed incumbent with the full weight of Mayor Bibb and Blaine Griffin behind him. He had the establishment pretty locked up and still this democratic socialist from War 12 cracked through.\n\nAnd he wasn’t the only progressive that got onto council. Nikki Hudson was backed by the same progressive groups. She also won in Ward 11. So it’s not just one upset. It’s the beginning of this real left flank forming inside Cleveland politics.\n\nChris Quinn (13:33.697)\n\nWhat’s interesting about this is about six weeks before the election, I had heard that he was getting some real traction and I was talking to a significant person in City Hall and I mentioned it and I was just kind of pushed aside. No, no. Kelly’s got this going away. There’s no contest here. It’s like, OK, we’ll see. And they couldn’t have been more wrong. I love the way that Sean McDonald framed this victory in writing the story. It shows the value.\n\nof having somebody that knows what they’re talking about doing it instead of some transcriptionist because he framed it the way you just did that this is a big moment. He had said, you are not responding to the needs of the people. I’m coming into city hall to change things. He is not going to be one of Boehn-Griffin’s favorites because he is going to be in his face, I think saying the status quo has got to go.\n\nall those traditional city hall types, they always stand on tradition and all their stupid little habits and things. This guy sounds like he’s a change agent and he’s going to be calling them out.\n\nLeila (14:40.72)\n\nI think on a very big level we’re going to see that too because we always have said for years and years that council members are so focused on their tiny corner of Cleveland that that’s where the votes come from. So that’s what they care about most getting for their neighborhoods and their ward. It’s so fiefdom oriented. But what struck me most when Shaw sat with our editorial board was that\n\nHis politics are really grounded in this deep understanding of the structural problems that are hollowing out his city, especially when it comes to housing. He wasn’t railing against the establishment for the sake of it. He was really talking about eviction rates, displacement, and how everyday families are being priced out of housing. And that’s the interesting parallel with, know, Mumdani, I think. So strip away the labels of democratic socialist and insurgent or whatever.\n\nYou’re really left with someone who’s laser focused on how regular people are supposed to live with dignity in a city where rent is rising and services are shaky and the systems that are meant to protect them don’t always do their job. And I was really moved by that. He has a very big picture view of Cleveland for someone who’s elected to represent a ward. We need people on council who have that perspective.\n\nChris Quinn (15:58.445)\n\nYeah, I wonder what he thinks about the unit rule where he’s required to cast his vote unanimously for the council president or get kicked out of all the caucuses. Doesn’t sound like he voted, but it doesn’t sound like he’s going to be greatly in favor of that kind of nonsense. You’re listening to Today in Ohio with shootings scaring people at two county fairs over the summer and hooliganism showing up at plenty of other gatherings. Cleveland had some strict rules for its winterland kickoff, Laura, down in Public Square.\n\nLeila (16:02.704)\n\nChris Quinn (16:27.489)\n\nWhat did the city do? How did it work out?\n\nLaura (16:30.251)\n\nThis worked. It’s great because of the 40 year tradition is a Cleveland special time and everybody was safe. They had new site tighter security that forced kids under 18 to be accompanied by an adult. And the way that they did this is they had only five entry points for those attending. And if you’ve been to public square, there’s a whole lot of entry points. There’s roads all around it. So they blocked off those roads starting, I believe at 7 a.m. that morning and set up these checkpoints where you had to come through. If you were under 18, you needed a 21.\n\nyour old guardian with you basically. And instead of making this a one-time deal where they turn on the lights of the big tree, they had a lot of different illuminate clea light shows beginning at 5 30 p.m. and repeating every 30 minutes through 11 30. So if you caught it at eight or you caught it at, you know, 10, it was the same show. So there was no huge crowd and they were trying to spread it out all through the day and through the season. So there’s not just so many people packed into one space because\n\nWe’ve talked about it, you and me, like around this podcast, would you take your family to something where you wonder if something bad could happen? Two years ago, a 15 year old shot two other teams. They were 13 and 15 and there were some skirmishes last year. That’s not what you want to be dealing with when you want holiday joy. So I’m so glad that they kept this safe.\n\nChris Quinn (17:51.169)\n\nI’m impressed they did it. When they first announced it, I thought this would be a challenge, but they took the right tack. The only way you can keep a crowd safe is to have checkpoints as people come in. We’ve seen it not just locally, but across the nation. When people get together, all you need is a couple of teenagers with the hormones raging that have guns, and people get killed and people get hurt. And it does cast a pall on these public gatherings. I wonder if\n\nLaura (18:06.146)\n\nChris Quinn (18:20.331)\n\nThe message we’ll get out now for future gatherings that it’s okay. If they have another concert downtown, the orchestra plays a concert, do they do the same thing? And is there a way to do it at Edgewater Fireworks, for instance? Because otherwise people will be afraid of getting together in crowds. We’ve heard from our readers about it. We’ve talked about it here. Unless you can do something concrete to provide that safety, I people stay away.\n\nLaura (18:48.525)\n\nI agree. It’s not something you want to put yourself or your kids in harm’s way. And this is a wonderful event. Like I said, 40 years of it. And they had Santa and the Grinch and s’more pits and food trucks and pop-up bars. It brings people to all the restaurants downtown if there’s not a Browns game or a Cavs game, right? It is an economic development driver. know that there’s Christmas merchandise at the Cleveland shops.\n\nAll of this is good and people feel good about their hometown and it’s easy to get to if you take your public transportation. So I’m glad it was a success. The photos that John Coons took were gorgeous. We had them in our extra edition and online. But it’ll be there all season. I’m going to go this coming weekend to the skating rink so you can go enjoy it.\n\nChris Quinn (19:34.869)\n\nWhen we talked about this stuff over the summer, I asked if you would take your kids to these kinds of gatherings and you said hard pass. Would this change your mind? I knew it. That’s why I asked the question. You’re listening to Today in Ohio. We were stunned at how shabbily Cuyahoga County executive Chris Renane was treating MetroHealth throughout the budget process. First taking steps that ended up shutting down.\n\nLeila (19:42.286)\n\nI don’t think so.\n\nLaura (19:43.382)\n\nLeila (19:46.736)\n\nYou know me too well.\n\nChris Quinn (20:03.083)\n\nthe psychiatric emergency room and then slashing the county subsidy. Layla, did the county council members have a greater sense of their responsibility to this vital institution?\n\nLeila (20:13.22)\n\nThey did. It turns out that county council absolutely felt more responsibility than Chris Rene did to restoring MetroHealth because while Ronane spent the entire budget season insisting that MetroHealth could absorb a multi-million dollar cut and made budget moves that helped shutter that psychiatric unit in the end, county council said, no, no, put that money back. And not just the three million that Ronane cut for next year, they restored the full\n\n$35 million annual subsidy, even though MetroHealth CEO had tried to play it cool and say that they could make do. So what changed here, county council members basically said they didn’t buy it. Dale Miller, the council president called MetroHealth situation too uncertain and too risky to gamble on. Charity care is exploding. I mean, more than a million dollars a day and looming Medicaid changes could yank thousands of low income patients off the rolls. And if that happens, MetroHealth gets stuck holding the bag.\n\nBecause the county backs MetroHealth’s debt with a $64 million letter of credit, a hospital financial crisis becomes the county’s crisis. So council members, including Michael Gallagher, Sonny Simon, they were really blunt about this. They didn’t believe MetroHealth was fine and they weren’t willing to starve the safety net hospital just to balance the books on paper. So they reached into reserves, they restored that full subsidy, even though it does blow a hole in the Health and Human Services levy fund. And the trade off is a little bit harsh because\n\nCouncil prioritized MetroHealth so heavily, almost nobody else got their money back, not the Adams Board, not the homeless shelter, not Juvenile Court, not Youth Services. Those cuts are all going to stand. So MetroHealth, it seems, was the big winner this budget season.\n\nChris Quinn (21:54.923)\n\nI would love to see each of the county officials show their priority list for county services, because I would think MetroHealth should be way up at the top. Children and family services way up at the top. Sheriff’s downtown patrol unit way down at the bottom. But I’d love to see it, because that is how they should make these decisions. And it sounds like with MetroHealth, they made the right one. We can’t let MetroHealth suffer. It does too many vital services for\n\nway too many people and I’m glad that they had the responsibility to fix this. I wish they could have kept the psychiatric emergency room open.\n\nLeila (22:33.934)\n\nYeah. mean, what council did here was really step back and look at the long game, because like you said, Chris, Metro Health is the backbone of the county’s entire safety net system. If that hospital falters, every vulnerable population in the region pays that price. So by restoring the subsidy, council’s saying, we’re not going to wait for a crisis to prove that these cuts were a mistake. It’s really rare in government, I think, to see proactive decision making instead of clean up after the fact.\n\nBut that’s really what this is. It’s this recognition that protecting MetroHealth now is far cheaper than trying to rebuild it after collapse.\n\nChris Quinn (23:09.889)\n\nThe Council’s had a very good focus on this whole budget process. Caitlin Durbin’s done a wonderful job reporting it, but they have been holding Chris Renane accountable in all sorts of ways, including what we’ve discussed previously about the Sheriff’s Office. Seems like they took their responsibility very seriously this budget season and examined it closely. They were not buying the executives’ nonsense. They were digging in themselves.\n\nLeila (23:14.98)\n\nLeila (23:35.781)\n\nYeah. You want to, you mentioned Caitlin Durbin. I just want to give her props here for really focusing the lens on these important issues from day one. She’s the one who dug into the details of his cut, Ronin’s cuts, connected them to the closure of the psych ER, kept pressing officials on the ripple effects. So her reporting really made it impossible for anyone to pretend that Metro Health situation was just another routine budget tweak. And I just really appreciate.\n\neverything that she’s done to kind of force transparency throughout this budget season.\n\nChris Quinn (24:07.723)\n\nYeah. Yeah, it’s been a public service. You’re listening to Today in Ohio. Lisa, this one seems like a surprise to me given the conservation efforts of recent years, but how much has plastic pollution in Lake Erie gone up in the past decade?\n\nLisa Garvin (24:24.778)\n\nIt’s actually pretty eye popping this is research by sherry mason who’s at the university in iri pennsylvania she’s a freshwater researcher and she first looked at plastic back in twenty fourteen and then checked again last year going to the same five sites every single one of them was up as far as plastic particles found in the water and she was actually expecting mixed results she thought it’d be lower in some areas and higher and others.\n\nSo three central basin sites that she looked at from Cleveland to Canada, there were 98,000 plastic particles per kilometer closest to Cleveland. That doubled in 10 years. In the middle of the lake in the central basin, 92,000 parts per kilometer. And that was up from 38,000, but most of it’s close to Canada. And a lot of this has to do with the way the lake flows anyway. But 188,000,\n\nthousand particles per kilometer closest to Canada. That was up from only 16,000 10 years before. And it’s much more dramatic in the Eastern end near Buffalo because you know, that’s where the water gets pushed towards the Eastern end of the lake. And I think the highest that we saw was 700,000 particles per kilometer off the Pennsylvania coast up from only 19,000. And this is stuff that she’s just scraping off the surface.\n\nShe says they’re missing what’s down below, know, plastic will get slime and algae and it’ll sink to the bottom. They didn’t even get to that stuff.\n\nChris Quinn (25:53.389)\n\nI’m really trying to understand the why of this because we have had some much more serious plastic conservation methods in the past 10 years than we had before her 2014 study. And I’m wondering, is this possibly coming from other states or is it coming from Canada? Lake Huron is the biggest source of water in Lake Erie, unless my sources are wrong on this. It’s way more than runoff, way more than the little rivers that feed into it. So is it coming that way or?\n\nAnother thought I had, there’s a thought that house paint is a significant contributor of particle plastics now because it’s latex and it washes off in the rain. Is it possible that the more intense storms we have today are washing more of that paint out into the sewers and into the lake? Because this just doesn’t make sense. I hope there’s some analysis done.\n\non what the plastic is specifically so that you can start identifying what the source is because what else where’s it coming from how could it go up that much in 10 years when people have moved away from plastic bags and things like that.\n\nLisa Garvin (27:05.274)\n\nWell, she mentioned COVID. She also talked about more intense storms. It drags larger plastic peaches off the beach and into the water where they get circulated around for years sometimes and get broken down. Most of what she found was about the size of a grain of rice or smaller. But also too, she talked about COVID when we were, know, people had all kinds of disposable things, know, medical waste, masks, things that people were just throwing away. And she feel, and you have to remember that when you wash,\n\nYour clothes, plastic particles off your synthetic clothes are getting into the water too.\n\nLaura (27:40.142)\n\nCan I jump in here? Cause I saw your note, Chris, about flaming Canada. And I was like, no, we are not going to blame Canada for this because yes. So the majority of water is coming from Lake Huron through Lake St. Clair and the Detroit river into Lake Erie. But Lake Erie has the biggest, most populated, densely populated watershed in the Great Lakes. 12 million people live within the Lake Erie watershed. That’s about a third of the total population of the entire Great Lakes watershed.\n\nLeila (27:47.8)\n\nLaura (28:09.997)\n\nLake Erie is the shallowest Great Lake, has the least amount of water. I think that’s why it gets so densely polluted because we don’t have a lot of water to offset all the pollution that’s flowing in. The biggest Canadian city on the Great Lakes that’s not on Lake Ontario like Toronto is Thunder Bay, which is about 110,000 people. There’s not a lot of people that live on the Canadian shores of the Great Lakes.\n\nSo my thought is maybe there could be a lot of pollution coming from Detroit. I mean, all of that water has to flow through there to get into Lake Erie. But I agree with Lisa that we’re just not even cognizant of all of the ways that we are putting crap into the water. All those water bottles that people drink, those are terrible.\n\nChris Quinn (28:49.527)\n\nwe’ve always done that. I mean, that we were doing that before 2014. What has changed so dramatically from 2014 to now? Again, I hope there’s an analysis of the plastic unless you know what kind of plastic it is and what the possible sources can be. I don’t think we can get at it. But this should be distressing to anybody who lives in the Great Lakes. This is where we get our drinking water from. This is a serious environmental hazard.\n\nLaura (29:14.871)\n\nChris Quinn (29:19.646)\n\nAnd it seems like we need to invest a lot more money in figuring it out.\n\nLaura (29:23.649)\n\nChris Quinn (29:25.121)\n\nYou’re listening to Today in Ohio. We’re only going to get seven stories today. Hot ones. We’ll leave a couple more for the discussion on Tuesday. Thanks, Laura. Thanks, Lisa. Thanks, Leila. Thank you for being with us today in Ohio. We’ll be back on Tuesday.",

        "text": "President Trump is obviously angered by inflation in health insurance, calling carriers “money sucking.” \n\nMajor benefit consultants including Aon and WTW are forecasting employer costs for providing coverage in 2026 will rise from 9.5% to 10.3%.\n\nEconomists worry that working Americans will suffer wage stagnation in a growing economy because higher premiums force employers to shift the costs of coverage to employees via higher deductibles and out-of-pocket payments.\n\nThis presents a smoldering political problem for the president as Zohran Mamdani’s win in New York City suggests “affordability” could become the watchword of a Democratic socialist midterm success.\n\nThe recent government shutdown was all about the affordability of health insurance. \n\nThe 15-year effort to make Obamacare America’s version of national health insurance, the left’s goal since FDR refused to put universal coverage in the 1935 Social Security Act, was exposed by its impact on the nation’s deficit.\n\nPresident Joe Biden used COVID to supercharge Obamacare enrollment and expand Medicaid so together they might overtake private insurance.\n\nUsing greatly enlarged subsidies and reduced eligibility requirements, 44 million more Americans signed up for government coverage.\n\nThe shutdown saw the Democrats argue that if these subsidies ended, people would die.\n\nThe president rightly saw the demand as incompatible with deficit reduction. \n\nThis contest will play out again in January when the continuing resolution ends.\n\nIt may be that one of history’s most important lost moments was Trump’s failure to deliver on his promise of “Repeal and replace” in his first term.\n\nThe House voted to repeal the hated plan more than 100 times. Yet no replacement has emerged, and Obamacare gets worse. \n\nThe law’s mandated coverage of a long list of preventive services, meant to reduce demand for costly inpatient care, had the opposite effect. \n\nHospitals were adept at stimulating demand, driving up costs.\n\nMany of the newly established local insurance exchanges meant to displace insurance companies went bankrupt. \n\nPolitically favored executives with no experience in health insurance were not up to the job of disciplining hospitals and doctors.\n\nHoping to save money by requiring digital patient records, Obamacare paid for their installation. Government chose vendors that produced the unbelievable — software that lengthened outpatient visits and raised their costs.\n\nPerhaps the most scandalous aspect of Obamacare is it mandated specialized agents to help potential enrollees “navigate” the system.\n\nCompensated on the number of eligibles they could enroll, agents signed up individuals they never met, who never knew they had insurance and never sought medical attention. \n\nThis mess was predictable from the start. \n\nTo get Obamacare passed, the insurance industry, consolidated two decades earlier into a handful of giant companies as a presumptive defense against Hillarycare’s promise to eliminate them, had to go along.\n\nEnjoying monopoly power, carriers drove up prices in cahoots with hospitals and doctors happy to deliver more costly care. \n\nTrump wants to disrupt the reign of these “big, fat, rich” companies.\n\nThe problem is Obamacare succeeded all too well in eliminating hundreds of competitors.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, despite his promise that we could keep our insurance company, intended just this outcome. \n\nHe believes efficiency comes with scale — a nonworking principle in health care. If it did, the resulting insurance monopolies and huge hospital systems would have made health care more affordable.\n\nWhile the administration works on the complexities of replacing Obamacare, it can take immediate steps to encourage the formation of many new health insurance companies including for-profits, nonprofits resembling original Blue Cross community plans and mutual companies organized by employer associations, religious groups and community cooperatives.\n\nThe government could provide capital for these startups and support shared risk pools for individuals with severe illnesses. Private reinsurance arrangements would follow.\n\nThe government should also immediately require radical price transparency — making providers show patients the cash price and the amount actually paid by insurance and Medicare/Medicaid. \n\nPatients could not only pressure providers for discounts but could be incentivized to search for fraud and billing abuse by participating in savings.\n\nThird, improving labor productivity in health care delivery is imperative.\n\nNearly 90% of all personnel working in health care, including in many instances unskilled kitchen and janitorial staff in hospitals, must be certified to work. \n\nLess than 20% of the non-health workforce needs the equivalent of a license to work. \n\nUsing its payment authority, the federal government should eliminate publicly required licensing and guild-imposed certification requirements that do nothing to ensure quality of care or service.\n\nLabor costs in doctors’ offices should also be a target. \n\nThe average doctor employs 3.5 staff in large part because insurance companies still require physicians to submit billing documents using fax machines! \n\nHow is it that government mandates digitized patient records but allows claims handling to continue on millions of pages of paper?\n\nTrump has said many times that the Affordable Care Act is anything but and must be replaced.\n\nOne step in that direction is to greatly expand the supply side of the health insurance market, letting competition emerge.\n\nCarl Schramm is university professor at Syracuse.

        "text": "We’ll know Wednesday morning if a special election in Tennessee is truly a referendum on country music, pedal taverns and bachelorettes. Or, we can divine a deeper political meaning from the results of the special election in Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District. Democrat Aftyn Behn is trying to tip the scales in favor of her party in a district which President Donald Trump carried by about 20 points and former Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., won by a similar percentage last fall. Behn faces GOPer Matt Van Epps. It’s a Republican district. But political observers are watching the race to gauge potential weakness by Trump, a softness in the Trump coalition, issues with the Republican brand or early indications of a possible blue wave in the 2026 midterms. TENNESSEE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE DODGES QUESTIONS ON PAST SUPPORT FOR DEFUNDING POLICE IN CONTENTIOUS INTERVIEW It was Behn who proclaimed that she abhorred Nashville several years ago. \"I hate the bachelorettes, I hate the pedal taverns, I hate country music. I hate all the things that make Nashville apparently an ‘it city,’\" complained Behn. About all Behn left out in her animus toward Music City was dissing The Grand Ole Opry, hot chicken and Goo Goo Clusters. But if voters go goo goo over Behn Tuesday, Republicans face a cluster of another sort. A Behn victory may signal major problems for Republicans and President Trump heading into the midterms. Behn is characterized as the \"AOC of Tennessee,\" a reference to progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. Republicans have been sure to boomerang that against Behn, suggesting she’s not in tune with the district, leans too far to the left, and is closer to the liberal values of New York or Los Angeles than Nashville. Republicans believe Behn is just a bad fit for Nashville. Kind of like having Bad Bunny perform at the Ryman Auditorium. \"It shouldn’t even be close, but it is,\" mused Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., on Fox. So Republicans are pouring in money to protect the seat. Democrats are pouring in money to steal the seat. If Democrats pull off the upset, the party should uproot the goalposts at FirstBank Stadium in downtown Nashville and dump it in the Cumberland River. Kind of what Vanderbilt fans did last year when the Commodores upset No. 1-ranked Alabama. FIRST ELECTION TEST FOR TRUMP'S TERM SURPRISINGLY CLOSE IN FL, GOP LOOKS TO INCREASE RAZOR-THIN HOUSE MAJORITY Let’s explore what a Behn win might mean for Republicans. It could indicate that voters are tiring of Trump. Or that the GOP brand is toxic. Or perhaps it’s the continuation of a trend which Democrats enjoyed this fall: near blowout wins by New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill and Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger. But there’s a downside for Democrats. Yes. They may flip the seat. But a win may also show that the party is tilting more to the left. It would be hard to argue with success if Behn prevails, regardless of her progressive streak. But this may give other liberals ideas that they can win in other red or purple districts. That may work against Democrats — especially since every Republican, except President Trump, has highlighted the left-wing politics of New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. Democrats probably need to run more centrist candidates in purple areas to regain control of the House. A Behn victory could open the floodgates for a host of progressive candidates in competitive House districts nationwide. Behn’s message — or that of Ocasio-Cortez or Mamdani — won’t work in most places where Democrats need to be successful to seize control of the House. But what if Republicans hold the seat and Van Epps wins? It probably depends by how much. TRUMP IGNORES ELECTIONS AS DEMOCRATS STUMBLE ON THE WAY TO LIKELY VICTORIES Yes, there were five special elections in 2017 — the first year Trump was originally in office — which Democrats made competitive. All were closer than they should have been. But Democrats didn’t win any of them. Still, astute political observers suggested there was unpopularity with the president and the GOP agenda. Democrats won 40 seats and gained control of the House in the 2017 midterms. So, even if Van Epps wins, examine the margin. And if Behn wins, see if Republicans downplay it because it was a special election and the customary electorate just doesn’t turn out for special elections. Especially one wedged between Thanksgiving and Christmas. If Republicans hold the seat, the GOP will argue this was a repudiation of a leftist like Behn and someone who was out of step. They will also suggest that it’s a GOP seat and Republicans should win anyway. That’s what happened earlier this year when there was consternation before two Florida special elections. But Florida Republican Reps. Randy Fine and Jimmy Patronis both won in March. Here’s another factor which bears watching: the message the press corps and political observers glean from the election results. After all, special elections are always special. It’s natural for analysts and journalists to search for particular meanings or signposts in these contests. Such was the case with the off-year elections in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City. Sometimes these observations are spot-on. Other times, they mean nothing. If anything, there is a tendency to over-illuminate the outcomes of these contests. They are moments in time. Kind of like listening to a few bars of a song. Maybe it tells you a lot about the song. Maybe not. SETTING THE STAGE: WHAT THE 2025 ELECTIONS SIGNAL FOR NEXT YEAR'S MIDTERM SHOWDOWNS House Republicans could well freak out if Behn is victorious. There’s lots of grumbling among Republicans. Some are frustrated by how their leadership handled the government shutdown. And others could follow Green and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and hit the exits early. This is a fragile time for House Republicans. That’s one reason why a flip of this seat could mean a little bit more. Still, it’s rare to flip seats in House special elections. Former Rep. Don Cazayoux, D-La., won a special election in a red district in Louisiana in 2008 after former Rep. Richard Baker, R-La., resigned. But current Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., then won that seat in the general election and served in the House before moving to the Senate. Former Rep. Mayra Flores, R-Texas, flipped the seat held by former Rep. Filemon Vela, D-Texas, in 2022. But she lost re-election that fall. Former Rep. Mike Garcia, R-Calif., won a special election in 2020 after former Rep. Katie Hill, D-Calif., resigned just months into office. Garcia held the seat until Rep. George Whitesides, D-Calif., defeated him a year ago. Former Rep. Charles Djou, R-Hawaii, won a special election in Hawaii in 2010 against two Democrats – former Rep. Colleen Hanabusa, D-Hawaii, and Rep. Ed Case, D-Hawaii. But Democrats got the seat back in 2012. Former Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, won a special election in 2022 to flip Alaska’s at-large district from red to blue following the death of late Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska. Young held the seat for nearly 50 years. But Rep. Nick Begich III, R-Alaska, defeated Peltola last year. In short, even if someone flips a seat, it’s rare that they have the seat for long.

        "text": "The more successful the villain, the more successful the picture.—Alfred Hitchcock\n\nMAGA needs a new common enemy ASAP. Without one, three things will happen before the end of 2026:\n\nMAGA infighting will escalate. When conservatives lack a common enemy, we cannibalize our own — and that’s gonna be our fate, because the Groyper/Tucker Carlson “purity test” is incompatible with the rest of the MAGA movement. Which means we’ll be clawing at each other’s throats while the Dems cruise to victory.Our trajectory won’t change without a PR change, and right now we’re headed for a 40+ seat blowout in the House. We lost every meaningful race on Election Day 2025; President Trump’s approval rating has dropped to the mid-30s; and by a 2-to-1 margin, more Americans blame Trump for raising prices than give him credit for lowering them. Ignore these warning signs at your own peril.The Democrats — and their sycophants in the media — will set the PR agenda, and their focus will be on affordability (more specifically, Trump’s failure to lower prices). From the mayoral race in the Big Apple to the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, the common denominator for the Dems was affordability. It’s the one issue that worked for far-left radicals, semi-left radicals, and radicals posing as moderates. And if we know anything about the Democrats, we know they simply can’t resist taking a good idea… and running it into the ground.\n\n(Of course, the Dems also take BAD ideas and run ‘em into the ground, too. It’s what they do.)\n\nWas the Biden administration responsible for runaway inflation? You betcha. Do the American people see it that way? No, they don’t.\n\nWe need to change our trajectory, and the quickest way is to cast a new common enemy.\n\nPinsker’s Law of PR #102: When your current trajectory leads to ruin, don’t be an idiot: Change your trajectory!\n\nIf you’re a PJ Media VIP member, this was a topic we discussed yesterday. (And if you’re not a VIP member, shame on you: Our blockbuster Black Friday bonanza ends at midnight.) The question we debated was, “As of today, who’s MAGA’s common enemy?”\n\nDon’t simply say, “It’s the Democrats.” That’s already baked into the cake. In a two-party system, it’s ALWAYS gotta be one or the other.We need more than that.Over the past few decades, Republican have — temporarily, at least — embraced all kinds of different, far-reaching missions. And each mission had at least one great enemy: There was the Cold War mission (bad guys: Russians, commies, and “useful idiots”). There was the Reagan Revolution mission (bad guys: country club Republicans, RINOs, and non-conservatives). There was the post-9/11 mission (bad guys: radical Islam and/or “the Axis of Evil.”). There was the Tea Party mission (bad guys: government waste, bloat, and debt).Then, of course, came the MAGA mission (bad guys: politicians and policies that put “America Last” instead of “America First”). But the MAGA mission has been around for over 10 years now. Donald Trump has either been running for president — or living in the White House — every day since June 16, 2015. And in some ways, he’s a victim of his success. He’s already closed the border, stopped illegal immigration, and reversed countless “America Last” policies.And today, the globalists are no longer the biggest threat to America’s well-being.\n\nWhich is why, as of Dec. 2025, we’re holding casting calls for MAGA’s next Big Bad. If political marketing is the art of strategic storytelling, then selecting our villain is just as important as choosing our hero, because it’s the villain who sets the stakes.\n\nNot the hero.\n\nStrategic storytelling demands it!\n\n(Or, to quote Doctor Who, “You can always judge a man by the quality of his enemies.”)\n\nAnd the telltale sign of a high-quality political villain is:\n\nThe contrast is clear, dramatic, and easily understood. Ambiguity must be avoided.It’s something that re-unites our side — but stresses the faultlines of our opponents.It’s gotta be based on something real and tangible. (That’s why the radical left’s “Trump is Hitler” PR campaign fell flat: it’s a fake argument.) And the #1 indicator that it’s a real, tangible issue is when the other side takes the bait and argues back on our terms.\n\nThe solution, I believe, is staring us in the face: Donald Trump and the MAGA movement must declare total, absolute political warfare on socialism.\n\nIt’ll re-unite our base. From free market-loving Reagan Republicans to Groypers to MAGA, the threat of a socialist takeover supersedes any disputes over Jews, Zionism, Trump, or tariffs. The ethos of capitalism — and rugged, risk-taking individualism — still resonates across the GOP.\n\nCapitalism vs. socialism is a winning issue for Republicans.\n\nIt’ll fracture the Democratic Party, because not all Democrats want to be socialists. (At least, not yet.) They might want MORE socialism, but they don’t want the government to seize their personal property and “socialize” their industries.\n\n(Especially the corporate kingpins who pull the DNC’s strings. They’re paying big bucks for crony capitalism and sweetheart deals — not a government takeover!)\n\nAnd just as importantly, leftists won’t be able to resist taking the bait. It’s not gonna be like their dopey “Trump is Hitler” PR campaign, where Republicans rolled their eyes and mocked the absurdity of the allegations. \n\nThe socialists in the Democratic Party will 100% engage with us!\n\nI mean… have you ever met a socialist?! Their favorite thing in the whole wide world is arguing about socialism. They WANT To have this debate!\n\nThey’re DESPERATE to have this debate!\n\nZohran Mamdani, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders (and so on) aren’t gonna shake their head and say, “That’s just crazy — we believe in free markets, limited government, and private property, too.”\n\nInstead, the opposite is true: With very little pushing, they’ll make our argument for us.\n\nBesides, socialism is un-American. It’s theft. Socialism necessitates the government takeover of wealth, private property, industry, and opportunity. You don’t own anything; it’s all controlled by the big, powerful government.\n\nBut right now, socialism is ascending. Its popularity is on the rise — mostly because socialism has positioned itself as a solution to the affordability crisis — and the danger is snowballing.\n\nFrom Rasmussen Reports: “Democratic Socialism 2028? Most Young Voters Say ‘Yes’”\n\nA majority of voters under 40 want a democratic socialist to win the White House in the next presidential election.A new national telephone and online survey by Rasmussen Reports and the Glenn C. Haskins Emerging Issues Center of the Heartland Institute finds that 51% of Likely U.S. Voters ages 18 to 39 would like to see a democratic socialist candidate win the 2028 presidential election. Thirty-six percent (36%) don’t want a democratic socialist to win in 2028, while 17% are not sure.\n\nIt’s a helluva storyline: A generational divide! A plot to steal private property! A high-stakes battle for the soul of our country!\n\nThe radical left is on the side of big government. And the only thing standing in their way is Donald Trump, the MAGA movement, and the Republican Party.\n\nPick a side, ladies and gentlemen: Gotta be one or the other.\n\nIt’s the smartest PR pivot that MAGA could make.\n\nOne Last Thing: The Democrats are on the ropes, but make no mistake: The donkeys are still dangerous. We need your help to succeed!

        "text": "Zohran Mamdani, the proud member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), has some very worrisome comrades in the DSA. One of them is Calla Walsh, a 21-year-old pro-Palestinian activist from Massachusetts, who went to Iran to sing the praises of Islamic martyrs and declare \"Death to America!'\n\nCalla Walsh, a proud member of Zohran Mamdani’s Democratic Socialists of America, flew to the Islamic Republic of Iran to declare:“Glory to all the martyrs, glory to the axis of resistance. May we see victory within our lifetimes. Death to America!”pic.twitter.com/fD6wRDnau7— Eyal Yakoby (@EYakoby) November 30, 2025\n\n\"Glory to all the martyrs,\" Walsh says. \"Glory to the axis of resistance.

Death to America.\"\n\nHow long are we going to keep pretending we can share a country? https://t.co/HpVFg8vLXI— Oilfield Rando (@Oilfield_Rando) November 30, 2025\n\nThat's an excellent question. Mamdani's got concerning ties to radical, anti-American, and pro-Palestine activists, and the DSA has made anti-American, anti-Israel policies part of its platform. The DSA is also pro-international law, and of using the authority of the U.N. and the International Criminal Court (ICC) to undermine and overrule American sovereignty and our Constitutional rights. Mamdani himself said NYC is now a \"city of international law\" and used that line of thinking to blame the city's Jews when a pro-Palestine protest broke out in front of the Park East Synagogue last month.\n\nWay to go New York. This is just the beginning. You have not only elected a socialist mayor, you have empowered his anti-American allies. https://t.co/sGtyXTcNyk— Julie Banderas (@JulieBanderas) November 30, 2025\n\nAnd they're not just in NYC. The DSA is running candidates all across the country, including Minneapolis and in Oregon.\n\nOther Democrats have cozied up to Walsh, too. Including Senator Elizabeth Warren.\n\nhttps://t.co/1i3P7bcH4A pic.twitter.com/NdPqxNX7tp— Stephen L.

Now, she believes they do, and — frighteningly — they're fine with being raped and murdered for the cause, so long as the rest of us go first.\n\nSoon Americans will realize that these liberals working for Shia Mamdani are connected to the the Shia regime of Iran. https://t.co/aKM3xKjKa0— Iranian American 🇺🇸 (@IranLionness) December 1, 2025\n\nHopefully, it won't be too late.\n\nRich white girl of privilege who grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Because they've been raised and educated to hate themselves and the country that made them rich and privileged.\n\nWhile Walsh doesn't have a formal role in Mamdani's campaign, they're both part of the DSA, and Walsh has praised Mamdani's socialist policies and vision for New York. In a Substack, Walsh criticized Mamdani for not being aggressive enough on the issues of Gaza and Palestine.\n\nHere's some of what Walsh wrote:\n\nThe blissful ignorance in response to Mamdani’s victory demonstrates a vast, abysmal void in revolutionary consciousness, organization, and leadership in the so-called United States. It speaks to our collective hunger for any supposed victory to grasp onto, no matter how illusory, a hunger to make ourselves feel like we have achieved something, anything, satiating our guilty selves with false hope.No matter how much he spits on the name of the Palestinian resistance, Mamdani obviously won because of the political ramifications of the Al-Aqsa Flood. The bar was incredibly low and his nominally pro-Palestine position was a breath of fresh air for an electorate reshaped by the Flood’s wide-reaching ripples. The Gaza Holocaust put the final nail in the coffin of a Democratic Party that was already on the brink of death.\n\nSo understand this: the person who chanted \"Death to America\" doesn't think Mamdani is radical enough.\n\nGood luck, NYC.\n\nEditor’s Note: Zohran Mamdani, an avowed Democratic Socialist, will be the next mayor of New York City.\n\nHelp us continue to report on his radical communist views and expose the Democrats who support him.

        "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Voters in New Jersey’s second-largest city will get another chance to elect a new mayor Tuesday in a runoff election. The race pits a Jersey City council member against a former governor attempting a political comeback more than two decades after resigning in scandal.\n\nCouncilman James Solomon and former Gov. Jim McGreevey were the top two vote-getters among seven candidates in the Nov. 4 general election, but neither received the vote majority needed to avoid Tuesday’s runoff. Both are Democrats, although the office is nonpartisan. The winner will replace outgoing Mayor Steven Fulop, who lost the Democratic primary for governor in June.\n\nSolomon was first elected to the council in 2017 after stints as an adjunct professor in Jersey City. He previously worked in the offices of longtime Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and then-Newark Mayor Cory Booker, now a U.S. senator. He was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 2015 but says he is now “completely healthy.”\n\nMcGreevey was elected governor in 2001 after serving in the state legislature. He resigned in 2004 and came out as gay after admitting an extramarital affair with a male staffer whom he appointed as a state homeland security adviser. The aide denied the affair and instead said the governor had sexually harassed him. McGreevey now bills himself as a “champion of second chances,” citing his work as executive director of a nonprofit that provides services to those adjusting to society after serving in prison, addiction treatment or combat duty.\n\nSolomon received about 29% of the vote in the general election, compared with about 25% for McGreevey. Hudson County Commissioner Bill O’Dea received about 22% of the vote, while former Jersey City Board of Education President Mussab Ali received about 18%. Three other candidates split the remaining vote. O’Dea, Ali and sixth-place finisher Christina Freeman have endorsed Solomon. Fifth-place finisher and Jersey City Council President Joyce Watterman endorsed McGreevey.\n\nMcGreevey has spent about $2.5 million on his campaign, compared with about $1.3 million for Solomon.\n\nDemocratic then-Vice President Kamala Harris received about 73% of the vote in Jersey City in the 2024 presidential election. Democratic then-U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill received about 82% in the 2025 gubernatorial election.\n\nIt is uncommon for a former governor to run for mayor, but McGreevey is at least the third to seek local office in the past year. Former Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo lost the race for New York City mayor to Zohran Mamdani on Nov. 4. In Delaware, Democrat John Carney was elected mayor of Wilmington in November 2024 after serving two terms as governor, four terms in the U.S. House and two terms as lieutenant governor.\n\nThe Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why.\n\nRecounts are very rare in New Jersey. The state does not have automatic recounts, but candidates and voters may request and pay for them, with the cost refunded if the outcome changes. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is eligible for a recount if it can determine the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome.\n\nHere’s a look at what to expect on Tuesday:\n\nRunoff election day\n\nThe runoff election for mayor of Jersey City will be held Tuesday. Polls close at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nWhat’s on the ballot\n\nThe AP will provide vote results for the mayoral runoff and declare a winner. Solomon and McGreevey are the only candidates.\n\nWho gets to vote\n\nAny registered voter in Jersey City may participate in the mayoral runoff election.\n\nWhat do turnout and advance vote look like\n\nThere were about 170,000 voters registered in Jersey City for the Nov. 4 election. Turnout for the mayoral general election was about 38% of registered voters. About 39% of the vote was cast early or by absentee ballot.\n\nAs of Nov. 26, about 3,000 mail absentee ballots had been returned. There is no early in-person voting for this election.\n\nHow long does vote-counting usually take?\n\nThe AP first reported results in the Nov. 4 mayoral election at 8:03 p.m. ET, three minutes after polls closed. The last update of the night was at 11:51 p.m. ET, with about 92% of the total vote counted.\n\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the 2025 election at https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2025/.",

A third candidate vying for the same seat devoted much of his campaign’s launch video to lambasting the current member of Congress representing the district over the funding he’s received from the pro-Israel lobby.\n\nThe incumbent in question – congressman Ritchie Torres – is one of the most staunchly pro-Israel advocates in Congress. Dalourny Nemorin, one of his challengers for the Democratic nomination to represent the district calls him the “poster boy” for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or Aipac. “Ritchie Torres cares more about Bibi than he does about the Bronx,” Michael Blake, another challenger, said in the launch video.\n\nTorres’s seat is not likely to be in danger – he is widely popular in his district, which spans a vast swath of the Bronx. But the messaging of his several challengers for the Democratic nomination to represent the district – five candidates have entered the race so far – underscore how major shifts in Americans’ views of Israel are beginning to seep into political campaigns. Public perceptions of Israel have soured after two years of its war on Gaza, and the historic election of Zohran Mamdani has proved that reflexive support for Israel – once viewed as a prerequisite for political viability – may no longer be a safe bet.\n\nAcross the country, candidates who are openly critical of Israel – including a record number who are of Palestinian descent – are entering local, state and federal races, donning keffiyehs and denouncing “genocide” in campaign materials. In Michigan, Abdul El-Sayed’s Senate bid seeks to replicate Mamdani’s insurgent campaign; in Georgia, Ruwa Romman, the first Palestinian-American elected to state-level office, is running for governor a year after being denied a speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nIn New York City, which holds primaries in June, voters said they preferred Mamdani’s approach to Gaza over that of his challengers. Several incumbent Democrats – including Daniel Goldman and Adriano Espaillat – are on the defensive over their pro-Israel stances. The race to replace Torres has put a particular spotlight on the changing calculus, with most other candidates in the race denouncing Israel’s actions as “genocide” and running aggressively against his record – even when that has meant walking back their own past support for Israel.\n\nTorres, who declined an interview request, has repeatedly questioned the Gaza war’s death toll, and labeled the global movement for Palestinian rights a “social contagion“. He has also dismissed his opponents and accused one of them – Blake – of fomenting “Jew hatred” for including in his campaign video a clip of social media influencer Guy Christensen, whom he said “glorified” the killings of two Israel embassy staffers earlier this year. (Blake told the Guardian that including Christensen in the video was “a miss” but did not remove the clip.)\n\n“We are witnessing a new crop of cynical candidates who treat antisemitism not as a crisis for our civilization but as an opportunity for their own personal aggrandizement,” Torres wrote in a social media post.\n\nHis opponents are betting voters can distinguish between antisemitism and criticism of Israel.\n\n“Ritchie Torres’s unwavering support for Israel is no longer the mainstream opinion; it is the fringe opinion,” Andre Easton, a public school teacher running as an independent candidate, told the Guardian in an interview. He cited recent polls that show 77% of Democrats believe Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. “This is something that we’ve never seen before.”\n\nTorres’s district – New York’s 15th – is regularly tagged “the poorest congressional district in the country”. Home to large Latino, Black, and immigrant communities, it fares poorly by most metrics and foreign policy does not usually rank at the top of voter concerns. In a viral interview with Adam Friedland, a Jewish comedian, last summer, Torres said that most of his constituents “are not talking about Israel, people are talking about how to put food on the table”.\n\nSome candidates took offense to that. “What it suggests is that we are not able to walk and chew gum, that we are not able to recognize the humanity of other people,” said Easton.\n\nIsrael’s war in Gaza played an outsized role in the New York City mayoral election. While he did not back down on his pro-Palestinian stance even as it offered a frequent attack line against him, Mamdani ran a campaign that focused primarily on affordability. Candidates looking to tap into his momentum are trying to emulate that focus while also connecting cost of living issues with the US government’s massive funding of Israel.\n\nMamdani served as a “barometer” for the temperature around the question of Palestine, said Nemorin, a public defender and member of Democratic Socialists of America who is also challenging Torres. The more than $21bn the US sent to Israel since October 2023 alone offer a way to link the issue to voters’ material interests. “There’s a conversation about where our tax dollars go,” she said. “The federal government is funding wars that lead to genocide”.\n\nDespite the messaging, Torres remains the clear favorite. His campaign is awash in cash including $1.6m he has received from pro-Israel lobby groups, according to Track Aipac, a project that tracks the lobby’s funding of US politicians. That funding has become a talking point against him as a large number of New Yorkers hold unfavorable views of the pro-Israel lobby.\n\nTorres’s opponents say he focuses on Israel to the detriment of his voters. In an interview with the Guardian, Blake, a former assemblymember who lost to Torres five years ago, cited an analysis that found Torres mentioned Israel “236% more” than he did “poverty” and repeatedly called out Torres’s Aipac funding.\n\nBut Blake himself spoke at Aipac events in the past and traveled to Israel on a trip sponsored by the group. He has since scrubbed old social media posts referring to Aipac and now says Israel’s actions in Gaza amount to “genocide” after previously rejecting the term.\n\n“I would hope you would want to have a leader who can see new information and make a change,” Blake said, to explain his turnaround. “I might have been in a particular place before, but I’m not there now.”",

        "text": "A sociology professor at Brooklyn College appointed to New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's transition team wrote a book about ending policing. \"I'm excited to announce that I have been asked to join the Mamdani Transition Team to work on community safety issues. A New Era for NYC,\" Alex Vitale said on X. Vitale is the author of \"The End of Policing,\" published in 2017. The book, which opens by explaining that police don't exist to help citizens, argues for an end to traditional policing for certain criminal activity, including narcotics use, prostitution, patrolling borders and \"misbehaving adolescents.\" The book also argues that police shouldn't combat street gangs. On ending gang units, Vitale argues that they are racist. MAMDANI KEEPS JESSICA TISCH AS NYPD COMMISSIONER \"In most cities, gang units function as a mechanism for racialized social control,\" the book says in chapter five. \"Black and Latino youth are labeled as gang members for hanging out together, while white youth groups are dismissed as harmless.\" Policing borders is also racist, according to the author. \"The expansion of Border Patrol powers has been justified through fear and racism. It legitimizes xenophobic narratives that define immigrants as threats rather than as fellow workers or neighbors,\" the book says in chapter six. MAMDANI TAPS PARTY INSIDERS TO STEER TRANSITION DESPITE VOWING TO ‘TURN THE PAGE’ ON OLD-GUARD NYC DEMS Vitale also describes border policing as \"inhumane.\" Chapter nine of the book argues against training police officers on implicit bias, claiming that police officers' views on race do not matter because the whole system of policing is racist. \"Racism in policing is structural, not simply a product of bad attitudes,\" the book says. \"Training officers to recognize implicit bias without changing what they are tasked with enforcing is like teaching a soldier to be sensitive while sending him to occupy a foreign country.\" The professor's faculty profile on Brooklyn College's website says Vitale has spent 30 years writing about policing and that he consults with law enforcement entities and international human rights organizations. He teaches courses about African Americans in the criminal justice system, according to his university profile. Vitale has often called to abolish police on his X account, including bicycle police, police helicopters and police in schools. He has also called to abolish joint terrorism task forces, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Border Patrol and even the presidency of the United States. MAMDANI RIPPED AFTER 'WORD SALAD' RESPONSE TO QUESTION ABOUT KEY ISSUE IN NYC: 'NO PLAN' He has also called for the NYPD to abolish its gang database. Neither Vitale nor Brooklyn College returned requests for comment. Mamdani has hired others who harbor anti-police sentiments. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Earlier this month, he announced that campaign advisor Elle Bisgaard-Church would join his staff. She has been dubbed the \"chief architect\" of Mamdani's campaign proposal to have social workers respond to certain non-violent 911 calls and is affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America. Mamdani officials did not return a request for comment. Fox News' Alec Schemmel contributed to this report.",

        "text": "The tight Jersey City mayoral run-off pitting sex-scandal-scarred former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey and liberal local pol James Solomon is eerily echoing New York City’s stunning showdown last month.\n\nIn one corner is the Democratic Jersey City-born ex-gov who has been out of politics for more than 20 years after he was forced to resign in disgrace thanks to a gay-sex saga.\n\nMcGreevey, 68, came out of political retirement to try to become Jersey City’s next mayor and is now taking on Solomon, a 41-year-old spirited, two-term downtown Dem councilman, in Tuesday’s election run-off to oversee the state’s second biggest city.\n\nBoth candidates have made “affordability” the key issue of their campaigns — focusing on affordable housing and skyrocketing property taxes — as they head into the run-off.\n\nThe similarities between the two Jersey City men and issues compared to the mayoral Big Apple, economy-driven match-up featuring progressive upstart Zohran Mamdani and ex-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo are aplenty. \n\nCuomo resurfaced to run for public office after a sex-harassment scandal drove him from the governor’s office in 2021. He has denied any wrongdoing over the allegations.\n\nResurrected pol McGreevey also has promised he can deliver based on his past political experience and pledged fiscal responsibility, as did Cuomo.\n\nSolomon, as with Mamdani, has meanwhile painted himself as the non-establish candidate who rallied his base by promising to take on developers who’ve reshaped the city’s skyline and capping rents.\n\n“Excuse my French, but New York City’s gotta get its s–t together,” Solomon said about the housing crisis across the Hudson River that’s pushed renters out of even pricier New York City and into Jersey City.\n\n“We’ve built a ton of housing. But we are basically sucking up the demand that New York City has failed to build housing.”\n\nJersey City’s housing stock has exploded over the past decade as other major cities now find themselves in a housing shortage. But most of Jersey City’s new projects have been for luxury homes along the city’s pricey waterfront and downtown neighborhoods.\n\nMcGreevey and Solomon share a similar plan that would require new major projects to build a minimum of 20% affordable housing units.\n\nBut McGreevey has slammed Solomon’s plan to cap some affordable units’ rent at $1,000, which he believes is not financially feasible because the requirements would have to be subsidized “in perpetuity.’’\n\nThe ex-gov has said that will ultimately cost the city and its taxpayers billions of dollars.\n\nSolomon for his part has also attacked McGreevey’s campaign for accepting money from developers who he alleges have received “sweetheart deals” from government officials for too long without helping working families.\n\n“The same corrupt political bosses are backing [McGreevey’s] campaign,” Solomon alleged.\n\nThe councilman added that the former governor is still “practicing a politics from 20 years ago” — tactics that made the city “significantly” less affordable.\n\nProperty taxes in Jersey City have meanwhile seen some of the biggest increases in the country in the past few years, which is largely a result of the city’s struggling school system’s lack of state funding.McGreevey has argued that the city government needs to be doing “fewer things well” to help cut costs for residents.\n\nHe has promised no increase in the municipal portion of the property tax levy in his administration’s first year.\n\nAs for President Trump’s national immigration enforcement coming to Jersey City, one of the most diverse areas in the country, where nearly 40% of its residents were born in a foreign country, McGreevey and Solomon each said that they’d do everything within their legal means to protect and educate locals.\n\nBoth have promised to keep Jersey City a “sanctuary city” in the face of threats and lawsuits from the Trump administration.\n\nThroughout his campaign, Solomon, who has served on the City Council since 2017, painted himself as an outsider among Hudson County’s powerful Democratic political machine.\n\nMcGreevey has been out of the political limelight since he resigned from the governorship in in 2004 and was forced to come out as gay after it was revealed he had an extramarital affair with a male aide.\n\nBut the residents of Jersey City have been welcoming in his return, he said.\n\n“I mean, people … understand it was to a large extent sort of, you know, grappling with my own personal reality,” he said about the scandal.\n\n“I have found people in Jersey City to be incredibly embracing, compassionate, thoughtful. So it had impacted [my campaign] much less than I would have thought,” he said.\n\nNeither candidate reached the 50% threshold needed to win outright Nov. 4, forcing a runoff.Solomon secured 29.2% of the votes, narrowly ahead of McGreevey at 25.1% and Hudson County Commissioner Bill O’Dea with 21.5%.\n\nO’Dea and most of the other mayoral candidates who previously appeared on the ballot have backed Solomon, who’s also received endorsements from New Jersey Sen. James Kim.\n\nMcGreevey has plowed ahead with the support of outgoing Democratic governor Phil Murphy and the city’s police union. The former governor, who also once served as the mayor of Woodbridge, said his “experience” is what voters can expect from him.\n\n“I mean, you know, no disrespect, but James has never managed anything,” he said.",

        "text": "The unexpected ascent of Zohran Mamdani can largely be attributed to the profound worries of New Yorkers regarding the growing unaffordability of their city. While the effectiveness of the prospective mayor’s policies in addressing this issue remains uncertain, there is no denying that the lack of affordability poses a severe threat to the future of both the city and the nation.\n\nIn my role as an investor in startups that align with particular values and as an advisor to entrepreneurs tackling significant civic challenges, I witness daily how innovation can enhance the quality of life for New Yorkers. Mamdani should consider partnering with the tech industry to confront the fundamental issues pushing residents to the edge, including affordability, safety, security, and access to essential city services.\n\nJessica Tisch, the Police Commissioner, exemplifies how technology can revolutionize city governance through her leadership at both the NYPD and the Department of Sanitation. Under her guidance, New York has launched the nation’s largest curbside composting program and initiated the process of containerizing waste. These advancements were achieved by integrating technology at every level, transitioning from outdated methods to GPS-enabled and real-time tracking systems.\n\nSimilarly, the NYPD introduced a mobile application providing officers with real-time emergency updates, replacing an antiquated system that depended on radios and paper documentation. Retaining Tisch as police commissioner is an encouraging early indication that Mamdani may embrace tech-driven innovations to enhance government services.\n\nThe housing sector also stands to benefit significantly from technological advancements. Though discussions have rightly centered on zoning reforms and investments in public housing, there is a vast potential to harness technology to enhance housing accessibility and efficiency immediately. Startups and nonprofits are developing tools to digitize and streamline processes like housing voucher applications and eviction defenses.\n\nTake Esusu, for instance, which aids renters in building credit through timely rent payments. For millions of Americans, rent is often their most significant monthly expenditure, yet it typically goes unreported to credit agencies.\n\nAcross every borough, we see the signs of government systems cracking under the weight of analog processes in a digital age. At H/L Ventures, we’ve backed companies solving real urban pain points — like Summer, helping New Yorkers with student loan assistance and college cost planning; Automotus, reducing traffic and double parking; inCitu, helping communities visualize new development; and Vivvi, helping companies offer early childhood education and care to working families.\n\nThese aren’t moonshots. They’re practical, proven, and scalable solutions that could serve New Yorkers better.\n\nTo be clear, embracing tech does not mean handing the keys to City Hall over to the private sector. It means building a smart, values-aligned collaboration between government, the tech sector, and civic institutions to deliver better outcomes for real people.\n\nIt means creating modern procurement pathways so that startups can work with the city without getting mired in red tape and waiting years for a pilot contract. And it means treating technology not as an industry silo, but as a cross-cutting enabler of more effective policy, job creation, and efficiency for our citizens.\n\nOne of the most promising opportunities lies in unlocking the immense value of city data to fuel real-time innovation. Tech:NYC, where I am a board member, has proposed RealTimeNYC, a citywide data access platform that would empower startups, researchers, and communities to build tech-driven solutions to urban problems using real-time, secure, and accessible data feeds.\n\nImagine if local developers could access data that show, in real time, where traffic bottlenecks are forming, which public trash bins are overflowing, or how air quality is fluctuating block by block. With this data, startups could pilot low-cost sensor networks to optimize trash collection, create apps that steer drivers away from congestion, or alert vulnerable residents during public health events.\n\nThe problems New Yorkers are most concerned about are real, immediate, and deeply personal. But they are not intractable. The path forward is not only about ideology — it’s about implementation. It’s about working with technologists, builders, and entrepreneurs who are already solving these problems in ways that are smarter, faster, and more equitable.\n\nThe livability of our city was the defining issue of this election. The Mamdani administration must make all efforts to solve it during his time in office. As I like to say, they must help provide a strong floor below which New Yorkers should not fall, but also offer no ceiling to what our businesses and innovations can aspire to achieve.\n\nLibby is managing partner at H/L Ventures.",

        "text": "In November 2024, Donald Trump won Tennessee’s 7th congressional district by 22 percentage points, as Republicans romped to victory in what has become one of the reddest states in the country.\n\nA year later, there is a very different story emerging in Tennessee’s 7th. Both parties are pouring millions of dollars into the district for a special election next week to replace former Republican Rep. Mark Green, who retired in July. And Democrats have a puncher’s chance of scoring an upset.\n\nThe sudden competitiveness of a special House election in a heavily gerrymandered Republican district is a good summation of Trump and the GOP’s current political freefall — and the rising political fortunes of Democrats.\n\nNothing says more about the toxicity of Trump and the GOP brand than a Republican candidate in an R+22 seat running away from the president and his party. \n\nBy all accounts, Republican Matt Van Epps, the former Tennessee General Services commissioner, is leading his opponent, Democrat Aftyn Behn, a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives, in the polls. (Though on Wednesday late last week, a stunning poll from Emerson College/The Hill showed Van Epps ahead by only two points, with a roughly four-point margin of error.) \n\nBut with Democrats overperforming in special elections in 2025 by around 13 points — as well as a couple of unexpected double-digit victories in gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, plus winning two statewide races in Georgia by nearly 25 points — seemingly even an R+22 seat could be up for grabs. \n\nYou don’t have to believe me. Instead, just follow the money. A pro-Trump super PAC, two other outside conservative PACs and the National Republican Congressional Committee have already spent more than $2 million in support of Van Epps. That wouldn’t be happening if Republicans felt comfortable that they had this race in the bag.\n\nMeanwhile, national Democrats, who initially seemed content to sit this race out, are also spending big. The House Majority PAC, which supports Democratic candidates, announced late last week it was spending $1 million on ads to boost Behn.\n\nCan Democrats pull off the upset? Vanderbilt University political scientist John G. Geer is skeptical. “It is a steep climb for Behn to win,” he told me. “Even making it a single-digit race is an accomplishment.” Still, says Geer, “it is clear that the GOP is worried.”\n\nJeff Yarbro, who is one of six Democratic members of the Tennessee state Senate (out of 33 total), has a slightly rosier view of the race. “Energy and attention [are] all going her way,” he told me. Van Epps doesn’t have “any real history with voters and is not generating any excitement.” He is, says Yarbro, “almost the perfect stand-in for ‘generic Republican.’” \n\nBehn, like successful Democrats in New Jersey and Virginia, has focused her campaign message on the latest buzzword in American politics: “affordability.” Her ads talk about rising health care costs and grocery bills, while painting her opponent as a tool of special interests and billionaire fat cats. \n\nNot surprisingly, Epps’ allies have portrayed Behn as a “Marxist” and a “lunatic” and have tried to tie her to New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Depicting a Democrat in a red state as a wild-eyed liberal is hardly a first, but with Behn, it’s a bit easier. She has a background as a liberal activist and has received backing from the Democratic Socialists of America, or DSA. In recent days, anti-police comments she made after the murder of George Floyd have also surfaced.\n\nBehn, however, isn’t exactly running away from her progressive past. She has made campaign appearances alongside liberal stars, who conservatives love to hate, such as Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, and activist David Hogg. Earlier this month, former Vice President Kamala Harris appeared at a campaign event (though Behn was not present). \n\nThe one thing that scares most members of Congress more than anything else is the prospect of a competitive election.\n\nIn a special election, turnout is everything, and Behn’s strategy seems to be “turn out my voters and hope enough Republicans stay home.” The Behn campaign has likely concluded that Harris’ ability to motivate Republicans is more than offset by the impact on partisan Democrats who voted for her last year.\n\nFor his part, Van Epps isn’t exactly leaning into the support he’s received from President Trump. Though the president endorsed him in a crowded primary field and appeared at a tele-rally earlier this month, Van Epps’ latest ad not only doesn’t mention Trump — it also omits his partisan affiliation. (Instead, the ad identifies Van Epps as “American Patriot.”)\n\nNothing says more about the toxicity of Trump and the GOP brand than a Republican candidate in an R+22 seat running away from the president and his party. And the aforementioned Emerson/Hill poll shows Trump’s favorability in Tennessee’s 7th district at just 47%, with roughly 49% disapproval — a stunning reversal of fortune for the president. \n\nStill, make no mistake, Van Epps is heavily favored to win. While Democrats have been running 13 points ahead of Harris’ 2024 numbers, that kind of performance would still leave Behn several points short of winning. However, a single-digit defeat could have a seismic effect on Capitol Hill. \n\nThe one thing that scares most members of Congress more than anything else is the prospect of a competitive election. For the lion’s share of Republicans in safe, heavily gerrymandered districts, they can generally waltz to victory. \n\nBut if Behn loses by six or seven points, Republicans in districts that Trump won by less than 15 points might start getting a tad nervous (for those keeping score at home, that’s 53 Republican members).",

        "text": "This month’s elections sent a clear message: When candidates put reducing the cost of care at the center of their platforms, voters approve.\n\nDemocratic candidates won three high-profile races in part by championing a care agenda. In New York City, Zohran Mamdani won his mayoral race on the bold vision of publicly-funded child care for every New Yorker. In New Jersey, Mikie Sherrill secured her gubernatorial win after championing the Child Care for Every Community Act, which caps family costs and raises wages for care workers. And in Virginia, Abigail Spanberger clinched the governor’s mansion on a campaign that named affordable child care and paid family and medical leave as essential to helping families make ends meet.\n\nThese victories, in locales and states with varying political demographics, are proof of what many families have known for years: That the United States’ affordability crisis is, at its core, a care crisis.\n\nFor a majority of people in the U.S., the “American Dream” no longer rings true. Families across the country are being squeezed by rising costs, from housing to groceries. In alarming numbers, people are skipping meals to save money, paying bills with credit cards and tapping into savings. But one of the biggest and most overlooked pressures is care, including child care, older adult care and disability care. Rising income inequality, recent research shows, is a key predictor of the erosion of democratic institutions, and the “care economy,” which is disproportionately shouldered by women, sits at the heart of this challenge. \n\nAccording to economist Matthew Nestler, the care economy has become one of the stickiest sources of inflation in the United States. Prices for home and community-based care have increased more than three times the pace of overall inflation since January 2024. In nearly all states, the cost of caring for children has outpaced even housing and health care, placing immense strain on families and the fabric of our democracy. \n\nFor working parents — and especially mothers — the impact is devastating. Polling from the Century Foundation shows women are having a harder time than men finding good-quality jobs, largely because of care responsibilities and unaffordable options. Too many families are trapped between impossible choices: Stay home and lose income, or work just to pay for care.\n\nWant more sharp takes on politics? Sign up for our free newsletter, Standing Room Only, written by Amanda Marcotte, now also a weekly show on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nThis isn’t a niche concern or a “women’s issue.” It’s an economic emergency hitting families in every community and income bracket. Just look at the 6.5 million older adults caught in the “middle market,” unable to afford long-term care but ineligible for Medicaid. Voters across the political spectrum are demanding solutions, and the candidates who treat care as foundational to the economy — and not as an individual problem — are winning.\n\nMamdani’s message to New Yorkers was simple: Care is a public good, not a do-it-yourself job. Across the river, Sherrill made the same case, showing that investing in care supports both families and the economy. In Virginia, where families pay an average of $30,000 a year for two children in child care, Spanberger tapped into bipartisan frustration over waitlists and unlivable costs.\n\nTheir victories demonstrate that care resonates because it shapes how families live, work and age. Child care enables parents to participate in the workforce and support their families. Paid leave gives workers and families the financial stability and time to lead healthy, flourishing lives. Home and community-based services allow older adults and people with disabilities to remain connected to their communities and live independently with dignity.\n\nThese incoming leaders are not alone in their vision of publicly-funded care. Just this month, New Mexico became the first state to offer free child care to all residents, regardless of income. Likewise, Connecticut’s new Early Childhood Education Endowment aims to make child care free for families earning under $100,000 and capped at 7% of income for others. After surviving a ballot initiative challenge, Washington will become the first state to provide benefits for home and community-based care for older adults and people with disabilities through the innovative WA Cares program. States like Colorado, California and Rhode Island continue to expand paid leave. \n\nThe path forward is clear. Sustained public investment in care policies and care workers isn’t just good governing — it’s good politics. The affordability agenda runs through the issues that hit all of us close to home, and no issue hits closer than who cares for us and our loved ones. We need to raise wages for care workers, expand support so no family pays more than they can afford and ensure care across different stages of life is at the center of any agenda that seeks to address peoples’ cost of living concerns.\n\nAs leaders like Mamdani, Sherrill and Spanberger are showing, putting care at the center of our politics is common sense. It’s what voters are asking for, and it’s what the country needs.",

        "text": "Bargaining over health care\n\nThe spectacle of politicians debating whether Americans deserve affordable health care reveals a profound moral failure in Washington.\n\nMillions face crushing premium increases while legislators squabble over party lines. COVID-era subsidies expire Jan. 1, yet Republicans remain divided over repealing, tweaking or abandoning the Affordable Care Act entirely. Meanwhile, families await their fates as political pawns. \n\nWhere is our humanity when access to medical care becomes a partisan bargaining chip rather than a fundamental right?\n\nOther developed nations solved this decades ago through universal coverage systems that prioritize citizens over ideology. We possess both the resources and knowledge; we lack only the political will.\n\nOur representatives must extend these subsidies immediately without preconditions. Call your senators and representatives today. Demand they put constituents before politics. Health care isn’t a privilege for debate — it’s essential for survival. We deserve leaders with the courage to act accordingly.\n\nBukekile Dube, Dallas/Midway Hollow\n\nFailed by capitalism\n\nTo those wondering why millennials and Gen Z overwhelmingly support self-proclaimed socialists like Zohran Mamdani, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders: “It’s the economy, stupid.”\n\nI am a millennial, and for many of our generation, the American Dream is dead. Boomers bought 40% of the houses and then raised interest rates so we never could. Meanwhile, we pay the highest rents of any generation, but our paychecks grow the slowest. And the last two boomers in the White House stole 20 cents of every dollar out of our pockets with their failed fiscal policies.\n\nEven if it once worked for you, today, the system you call capitalism is failing younger Americans. If you want us to support it again, then fix it so it begins to work for us, too. Otherwise, Mamdani is just the latest electoral outcome of our rejection of the status quo that will continue to spread.\n\nAt the same time, there’s no such thing as a free lunch, rent control has historically failed, and many of Mamdani’s grander campaign promises will likely go unfulfilled. Accordingly, you can always just sit on your hands until then, and we may come back around to hearing about capitalism’s promises.\n\nPhilip S. Wiseman, Carrollton\n\nAfter walking my dog around the school grounds at Winters Park soccer field, I saw a beautiful sight. Several families had gathered to play soccer and picnic at the soccer field. Unfortunately, they had to climb the short chain link fence to gain entry, because the city of Garland has chosen to lock out us undesirable tax-paying citizens. \n\nThey want to save the fields for elite sports groups and organizations. The fields stand empty most of the year, and it makes no sense that they lock people out because they might leave a mess. \n\nAs I recall, the sports groups leave the field filled with garbage, holes in the turf and damaged trees. Yes, there are other parks in Garland, but Winters Park is in a pretty safe area, and there is room for everyone. I paused to watch for a moment, young families with children laughing and kicking a soccer ball. Isn’t that what is supposed to happen in America?\n\nLaura Manno, Garland\n\nGhosts on the bridge\n\nRe: “Why I’m thankful,” by Peter Johnson, Thursday Opinion.\n\nI have often wanted to write concerning Johnson’s columns, but this is the first time I have actually followed through. I am not a person of color, and I was not in a position to participate in any marches during the ’60s, but I kept up with the news. \n\nThus, in 1984, I prepared to visit my in-laws in Tallahassee, Fla. I decided to include Selma, Ala., on my route. I felt ghosts as I drove through the town and as I neared the Edmund Pettus Bridge. I drove over it carefully; there was little traffic that day, and I continued on the highway to Montgomery. \n\nI tried to envision myself walking over it with the throngs of people who marched that day years before. Every time Johnson mentions the bridge in a column, I relive that day and wish I could have been with the original marchers. God bless him and his family. Thanks to The News for including him in your team of talented columnists.\n\nCynthia R. Gudgel, Denison\n\nBuilding servant leaders\n\nIn 2005, I attended Scouting’s National Jamboree in Virginia. While completing the music merit badge, I wrote a trumpet duet full of teenage zeal. Our instructors, two military musicians, played it for me right then. My music, performed by somebody else for the first time — I’d only begun to hear.\n\nWhy has Scouting changed since its founding? Why has America changed? Our story of freedom and opportunity has attracted diverse communities, and just as a good general knows, unity, trust and respect can turn strangers into a cohesive whole. Scouting introduced me to kids from all backgrounds, each uniquely skilled. We learned from each other, developed leadership, responsibility and character, and had enormous fun. These I hope to pass on to my daughter when she joins Cub Scouts soon.\n\nScouting today is more diverse, coed, interfaith and accessible because that’s the face of America. To be leaders of the future, our kids must thrive in a diverse society. Scouting teaches service and creates servant leaders. The Scout Oath and Law, a century old, do much more than “cultivate masculine values.” Those soldiers taught me to celebrate what the other has to offer, and that together we can make something new.\n\nMario Koym-Garza, Dallas",

        "text": "We’ll know Wednesday morning if a special election in Tennessee is truly a referendum on country music, pedal taverns and bachelorettes. Or, if we can divine a deeper political meaning from the results of the special election in Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District. Democrat Aftyn Behn is trying to tip the scales in favor of her party in a district which President Trump carried by about 20 points and former Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., won by a similar percentage last fall. Behn faces GOPer Matt Van Epps. It’s a Republican district. But political observers are watching the race to gauge potential weakness by President Trump, a softness in the Trump coalition, issues with the Republican brand or early indications of a possible blue wave in the 2026 midterms. DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS GO ALL IN ON FINAL 2025 CONGRESSIONAL BALLOT BOX SHOWDOWN It was Behn who proclaimed that she abhorred Nashville several years ago. \"I hate the bachelorettes, I hate the pedal taverns, I hate country music. I hate all the things that make Nashville apparently an ‘it city,’\" complained Behn. About all Behn left out in her animus toward Music City was dissing The Grand Ole Opry, hot chicken and Goo Goo Clusters. But if voters go goo goo over Behn Tuesday, Republicans face a cluster of another sort. A Behn victory may signal major problems for Republicans and President Trump heading into the midterms. Behn is characterized as the \"AOC of Tennessee,\" a reference to progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. Republicans have been sure to boomerang that against Behn, suggesting she’s not in tune with the district, leans too far to the left and is closer to the liberal values of New York or Los Angeles than Nashville. Republicans believe Behn is just a bad fit for Nashville. Kind of like having Bad Bunny perform at the Ryman Auditorium. \"It shouldn’t even be close. But it is,\" mused Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., on Fox. So Republicans are pouring in money to protect the seat. Democrats are pouring in money to steal the seat. If Democrats pull off the upset, the party should uproot the goalposts at FirstBank Stadium in downtown Nashville and dump it in the Cumberland River. Kind of what Vanderbilt fans did last year when the Commodores upset number one-ranked Alabama. Let’s explore what a Behn win might mean for Republicans. It could indicate that voters are tiring of President Trump. Or that the GOP brand is toxic. Or perhaps it’s the continuation of a trend which Democrats enjoyed this fall: near blowout wins by New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherill and Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger. But there’s a downside for Democrats. Yes. They may flip the seat. But a win may also show that the party is tilting more to the left. It would be hard to argue with success if Behn prevails, regardless of her progressive streak. But this may give other liberals ideas that they can win in other red or purple districts. That may work against Democrats – especially since every Republican, except President Trump – has highlighted the left-wing politics of New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. TRUMP MAKES 11TH-HOUR PLEA FOR MATT VAN EPPS OVER AFTYN BEHN, WHOM HE CLAIMS 'HATES CHRISTIANITY' Democrats probably need to run more centrist candidates in purple areas to regain control of the House. A Behn victory could open the floodgates for a host of progressive candidates in competitive House districts nationwide. Behn’s message – or that of Ocasio-Cortez or Mamdani – won’t work in most places where Democrats need to be successful to seize control of the House. But what if Republicans hold the seat and Van Epps wins? It probably depends by how much. Yes, there were five special elections in 2017 – the first year President Trump was originally in office – which Democrats made competitive. All were closer than they should have been. But Democrats didn’t win any of them. Still, astute political observers suggested there was unpopularity with the president and the GOP agenda. Democrats won 41 seats and gained control of the House in the 2018 midterms. So, even if Van Epps wins, examine the margin. And if Behn wins, see if Republicans downplay it because it was a special election and the customary electorate just doesn’t turn out for special elections. Especially one wedged between Thanksgiving and Christmas. If Republicans hold the seat, the GOP will argue this was a repudiation of a leftist like Behn and someone who was out of step. They will also suggest that it’s a GOP seat and Republicans should win anyway. That’s what happened earlier this year when there was consternation before two Florida special elections. But Reps. Randy Fine, R-Fla., and Jimmy Patronis, R-Fla., both won in March. Here’s another factor which bears watching: the message the press corps and political observers glean from the election results. After all, special elections are always special. It’s natural for analysts and journalists to search for particular meanings or signposts in these contests. Such was the case with the off-year elections in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City. Sometimes these observations are spot-on. Other times, they mean nothing. If anything, there is a tendency to over-illuminate the outcomes of these contests. They are moments in time. Kind of like listening to a few bars of a song. Maybe it tells you a lot about the song. Maybe not. House Republicans could well freak out if Behn is victorious. There’s lots of grumbling among Republicans. Some are frustrated by how their leadership handled the government shutdown. And others could follow Mark Green and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and hit the exits early. This is a fragile time for House Republicans. That’s one reason why a flip of this seat could mean a little bit more. DEM HOUSE HOPEFUL GETTING YANKED FROM GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DURING ATTEMPTED SIT-IN GOES VIRAL AHEAD OF ELECTION Still, it’s rare to flip seats in House special elections. Former Rep. Don Cazayoux, D-La., won a special election in a red district in Louisiana in 2008 after former Rep. Richard Baker, R-La., resigned. But current Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., then won that seat in the general election and served in the House before moving to the Senate. Former Rep. Mayra Flores, R-Texas, flipped the seat held by former Rep. Filemon Vela, D-Texas, in 2022. But she lost reelection that fall. Former Rep. Mike Garcia, R-Calif., won a special election in 2020 after former Rep. Katie Hill, D-Calif., resigned just months into office. Garcia held the seat until Rep. George Whitesides, D-Calif., defeated him a year ago. Former Rep. Charles Djou, R-Hawaii, won a special election in Hawaii in 2010 against two Democrats – former Rep. Colleen Hanabusa, D-Hawaii, and Rep. Ed Case, D-Hawaii. But Democrats got the seat back in 2012. Former Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, won a special election in 2022 to flip Alaska’s at-large district from red to blue following the death of late Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska. Young held the seat for nearly 50 years. But Rep. Nick Begich III, R-Alaska, defeated Peltola last year. In short, even if someone flips a seat, it’s rare that they have the seat for long. Often, only through the next regular election. So a word of caution as you evaluate the election results on Tuesday night. If Republicans hold the seat, that may be expected. If Democrats flip the seat, some will proclaim it’s the second coming of the Music City Miracle. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP But frankly, it’s probably not.",

        "text": "In August, New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani hosted a citywide scavenger hunt, inviting voters to scour the boroughs in search of historic political sites. (Grand prize: a bag of chips.) Clues for it were written by veteran puzzle maker Natan Last, who has long endorsed the idea that puzzles at their best blend politics, community and a nerdy good time. If you missed the hunt, Last’s book, “Across the Universe,” delivers similar pleasures. Though its subtitle — “The Past, Present, and Future of the Crossword Puzzle” — suggests a history tome, Last approaches the subject essayistically. Crosswords, for him, are arguments on behalf of things: of what qualifies as “common knowledge,” of what role puzzles should play in informing a citizenry, of how wordplay and slang snake into the mainstream. “The crossword is a uniquely capacious artifact ready to absorb and recast any group's predilections and passions into puzzle form,” he writes. That may seem like making too much out of an everyday diversion. But as Last points out, crosswords have long been a miniature version of America’s larger culture wars. Crosswords' popularity exploded in the 1920s in various newspapers; Ernie Bushmiller, cartoonist of “Nancy” fame, exploited the “crossword craze” in a strip called “Cross Word Cal.” But killjoys swiftly arrived to dismiss it as paleolithic brain rot. The New York Times, now the best-known purveyor of crosswords, thought the puzzle beneath it, and didn’t offer one until 1941. (“The last adult in the newsroom,” Last smirks.) The New York Times’ crossword is synonymous with its current editor, Will Shortz, who gave the puzzle a refresh in the 1990s, jettisoning academic jargon and obscurities in favor of layered puns and pop-culture references. Last recalls working as Shortz’s intern in 2009 and loving the experience. But Last is also the point of the spear among constructors who insist there’s plenty of room for improvement: tokenized ethnic terms, lack of gender parity among constructors, double standards (“erotica” is acceptable, but “gay erotica” isn’t?), a narrow view of what readers know or will accept. “The bar is on the floor,” USA Today crossword editor Erik Agard tells Last. Last’s range and intelligence help sell the importance of the crossword, then and now. Still, its lack of a direct throughline can be frustrating. Like a particularly manic solver, he attacks the subject in an across-and-down fashion, here contemplating the impact of AI on the game, there considering what role crossword-style wordplay had on Modernist writers like T.S. Eliot and Gertrude Stein, now contemplating the 1920s crossword craze, now skipping to its 2020s COVID-prompted renaissance. It’s all relevant, and Last is a bright and witty guide through all of it. He demands a certain comfort level with disorientation, though. Still, that’s kind of the point: For him, puzzles should motivate solvers to be more than half-thinking box fillers. Instead, we should be comfortable learning new ideas through the puzzle. Mamdani’s scavenger hunt didn’t play a big role in his eventual election to the mayorship in October; it probably didn’t even play a small one. But it spoke to the concepts of play, surprise and diversity that the crossword at its best represents for Last. Maybe you don’t have immediate recall on the word “Haudenosaunee” (the Native name for the Iroquois Confederacy), but what’s so bad about a crossword puzzle introducing you to it? Like every other section of the paper, the crossword can bring the news. It can evoke — and shape — a culture.",

        "text": "President Donald Trump is attached at the hip to Fox News, the right-wing propaganda network. The relationship goes back more than a decade, when Fox held a regular commentary slot open for Trump to promote the racist birther conspiracy about then-President Barack Obama.\n\nIn that time, Fox has been a ceaseless promoter of Trump, his ideas, and his rhetoric while serving as a weapon to attack his enemies and the truth. Fox’s devotion to Trump runs so deep that the network paid out nearly $800 million because it pushed his lies about winning the 2020 presidential election.\n\nTrump and Fox may have the occasional public disagreement, but at the end of the day, they are unified. The past year has seen Trump back in the White House—and Fox News was with him every step of the way.\n\nHere are the 29 most cringe-inducing moments of Fox working in service of Trump in 2025.\n\n1. Praised Trump for his lack of inauguration diversity\n\nFox’s Jesse Watters apparently has had enough of past inauguration ceremonies that looked like America—you know, diverse. In January, he praised the choice of singer Carrie Underwood to sing “America the Beautiful,” remarking, “I'm just happy Carrie Underwood is performing. When a straight, blonde female is singing at the inauguration, I think we're back. I think we're definitely back.”\n\n2. Promoted a ridiculous list of Trump “accomplishments”\n\nA hundred days into Trump’s second term, the results were underwhelming. Trump had taken a battering ram to multiple agencies and imposed tariffs that were increasing costs, but he had accomplished few of his campaign promises, so Fox made up a list of weak wins and inflated their significance.\n\nThe network hailed Trump for ending production of the penny, establishing the destructive so-called Department of Government Efficiency, appointing members of a pro-pollution “energy dominance council,” creating a “strategic Bitcoin reserve,” renaming the Gulf of Mexico, and getting his Cabinet confirmed (which is something every president does).\n\n3. Got mad at Gavin Newsom for trolling Trump\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom emerged as one of Trump’s highest-profile detractors in 2025. Newsom and his team endlessly mocked Trump on social media, using graphics and videos to deflate Trump’s grandiose self-image.\n\nFox was mad about it. According to an analysis of Fox content conducted for Daily Kos by Media Matters for America, Fox went on and on (and on) about Newsom for 2 hours and 33 minutes across 71 segments over about a two-week period. For cable news, this is an exhaustive amount of attention.\n\nPro-Trump host Greg Gutfeld whined that a “team of dorks” was mocking Trump, while Sean Hannity’s show claimed the funny Newsom posts were proof the governor is “angry.”\n\n4. Influenced Trump’s decision to bomb Iran\n\nIn June, Trump bombed three Iranian nuclear sites in what Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez described as a “grave violation of the Constitution.”\n\nTrump’s habitual viewing of Fox reportedly played a role. The network hyped up the need to get into a conflict with Iran, telling viewers a conflict would “be over within two days.” At the same time, a delegation of hawkish conservative activists—including Fox host Mark Levin—visited the White House to push for an attack. Soon, bombs were falling.\n\n5. Got sued by Newsmax for bullying\n\nThe lesser-known Newsmax channel is in line with Fox’s promotion of right-wing causes and misinformation, such as pushing election lies. But in September, Newsmax sued Fox News.\n\nNewsmax’s complaint alleges that Fox used its influence to bully cable and satellite providers away from carrying Newsmax. Newsmax accused it of exercising a “monopoly” for right-wing audiences and alleged that the network was incapable of operating on a level playing field.\n\n6. Handed a TV show to a racist\n\nFox has spent years platforming bigots of all sorts. In September, former Trump press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, a Fox pundit, was given her own show, “Saturday In America.”\n\nLike Trump, McEnany had pushed the racist “birther” conspiracy and argued—with a straight face—that Trump “doesn’t lie.” At the point in his presidency that she’d said that (2020), Trump had racked up at least 16,241 falsehoods, according to The Washington Post.\n\n7. Slobbered over Trump’s unhinged U.N. speech\n\nTrump gave a widely panned, aggressive speech to the United Nations in September. Most world observers found Trump’s rhetoric insulting and littered with lies.\n\nFox loved it. Seconds after Trump finished speaking, Fox host Harris Faulkner proclaimed to her viewers he had been delivering “raw truth.” Fact-checkers following along with the speech in real time determined that much of it was false.\n\n8. Turned an escalator malfunction into a scandal\n\nDuring that same U.N. appearance, Trump was embarrassed when an elevator malfunctioned while he rode it. Fox News saw this basic mechanical failure as a more sinister development. Soon, the network was asking conspiracy-laden questions about “Escalatorgate.”\n\n9. Gave Stephen Miller a safe space\n\nSenior White House aide and longtime racist Stephen Miller was the recipient of pointed criticism from New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in October. Discussing his anti-immigrant policies, Ocasio-Cortez said “he is so mad that he is 4 [foot] 10 [inches tall] that he’s taking that anger out at any other population possible.”\n\nHours later, Miller was booked on Laura Ingraham’s show so he could express his anger at the congresswoman. His retort? “Her eyes don’t work.\n\n10. Pushed racist anti-Mamdani smears\n\nAlong with its sister outlet, The New York Post, Fox aired segment after segment falsely connecting New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani to terrorism and communism. Fox even raised the notion that Mamdani should be deported.\n\nThe campaign didn’t work and Mamdani easily won, but Fox gave it their all.\n\n11. Tried to hide the Epstein story\n\nThe Trump administration’s decision to hide files related to accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein angered even some on the right. But Fox News was there to show loyalty to Trump and Epstein instead of to the women who say they were victimized by Epstein.\n\nEven when their sister publication, the Wall Street Journal, reported that Trump’s name was purportedly included in Epstein documents, Fox went silent. Instead of reporting news affecting the highest levels of the government, Fox effectively ignored the story for days. Again, the furor still hasn’t died down, but Fox is part of the effort to make it go away.\n\n12. Tried to make viewers care more about jeans instead of sex trafficking\n\nWhile in the throes of covering for Trump on the Epstein issue, Fox figured its audience needed to hear about designer jeans instead.\n\nInstead of the Epstein story, which dominated coverage elsewhere, Fox focused on a purported controversy over an advertisement for American Eagle by Sydney Sweeney. Fox covered 1 hour and 25 minutes on Sweeney’s jeans ad, compared with 3 minutes of Trump-Epstein.\n\n13. Praised Trump for walking\n\nIn August, Trump suddenly appeared on the White House roof, walking around aimlessly. To most of the world, this was a cringe-inducing moment, lending credence to the idea of Trump’s mental decline.\n\nOn Fox, the odd walk was a triumph. Hannity insisted it was “amazing,” while Watters claimed it was evidence Trump is a “political giant.” Pundit Jimmy Failla insisted the weird moment was “historic.”\n\n14. Saw their election deception exposed\n\nAs part of its ongoing lawsuit against Fox for election lies, voting-machine company Smartmatic uncovered internal Fox messages that further revealed the depths of the network’s deception. The messages show Fox personalities and producers aware that they were telling election lies.\n\nAnchor Bret Baier admitted in a message that Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo was peddling “crap” about the election. Both are still employed at Fox.\n\n15. Asked Trump to prosecute CNN for journalism\n\nIn July, after CNN reported on an app that warned people of nearby immigration raids, Fox legal analyst Emily Compagno called for federal intervention into CNN. Compagno argued that Attorney General Pam Bondi would have a “strong case” against CNN if her department chose to press charges against the network—for doing basic journalism.\n\n16. Melted down over a bishop calling for mercy\n\nFox’s coverage in the week following Trump’s inauguration pushed the idea that his narrow victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris meant everyone had to get in line with his unpopular agenda.\n\nThe network directed its ire against Right Rev. Mariann Budde, an Episcopal bishop who delivered the national prayer service following Trump’s swearing-in. Budde invoked the church’s teachings on mercy, urging the administration to demonstrate the Christian value toward migrants and the LGBTQ+ community. \n\nIn response, Fox spent hours attacking Budde, questioning her religious standing, criticizing her gender and her rhetoric. The woman they described as a “woke bishop” was not hailing Trump—and that made her the enemy.\n\n17. Saw Fox hosts elevated to disaster response officials\n\nTrump’s first month in office saw the worst commercial jet crash in 15 years, and the officials tasked with responding had been, mere weeks before, part of the team on Fox News.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy spent years at Fox after performing as a contestant on MTV’s “Road Rules,” while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth became infamous as a Fox host for pushing sexism and bragging about never washing his hands.\n\nThe two men being the lead federal responders to the disaster emphasized how much Trump relies on Fox as his staffing agency, resulting in senior leaders more familiar with makeup and teleprompters than how to respond to an emergency.\n\n18. Saw former Fox host fumbling justice\n\nSpeaking of former Fox News personalities littered throughout the Trump administration: Jeanine Pirro. Trump recruited the host, who has written multiple sycophantic pro-Trump books, to serve as his U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.\n\nPirro has not covered herself in glory. Grand juries have refused to follow Pirro’s lead with partisan indictments, while her office failed to convict the now-famous “sandwich guy” protester. The jury did not buy Pirro’s over-the-top argument that one thrown sandwich was a harbinger of terror.\n\n19. Lied about Jan. 6 rioters\n\nWhen Fox isn’t paying through the nose for its lies about the 2020 election, the network is part of Trump’s disinformation campaign about the conservative attack in response to losing the election.\n\nThis past January, during a discussion of the Capitol insurrection, Fox host Rachel Campos-Duffy argued that the attackers were “political dissidents.” Dissidents usually don’t try to overturn perfectly legal elections while wearing absurdist cosplay, for the record.\n\n20. Hired Trump’s daughter for her latest nepo job\n\nLara Trump served as co-chair of the Republican Party because she is Trump’s daughter-in-law, not for her supposed political insight. Largely for this same reason, Fox announced in February that she would be the network’s newest host. As predicted at the time, “My View with Lara Trump has been another venue for pro-Trump propaganda and not much else.\n\n21. Hosted a Musk-Trump lovefest\n\nBefore Trump and his billionaire benefactor Elon Musk were sniping at each other in the press, both men appeared on Fox in February for a chummy interview with Hannity.\n\nThe pair all but held hands as they gushed about each other, with Trump making it clear that Musk could use DOGE to unethically aid the fortunes of his companies. He did just that.\n\n22. Whined about lying, despite its own history of lying\n\nHannity has spent nearly 30 years at Fox News, lying about issues big and small. He earns millions of dollars forwarding lies about liberals, Democrats, and anyone else who doesn’t march in lockstep with his ideology.\n\nAnd yet, in a February interview, Hannity complained about his supposed pet peeve: lying. \n\n“That’s why legacy media is dead. They don’t know it yet because they don’t tell the truth,” Hannity said. \n\n23. Defended economy-harming tariffs\n\nBusinesses tend to oppose tariffs since they increase the costs of goods and lead consumers to hold back on spending. On paper, this would put Fox Business in opposition to tariffs, but the network exists largely to prop up conservatism and the Republican Party.\n\nThat leads to moments like the roundtable on Fox Business in March, where panelists had to twist themselves into knots to be pro-tariff. For instance, contributor Charles Payne claimed that tariffs have “been associated with some of the biggest boom times we’ve ever had” and cited the 1920s. Of course, that boom led right to the Great Depression, but Fox didn’t bother to mention that.\n\n24. Said leaking war plans is good, actually\n\nSecretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and other senior members of the Trump administration were in hot water in March after it was discovered that military plans were inadvertently leaked to a reporter.\n\nBut for Fox host Will Cain, this was a great moment. Cain argued, “After years of secrecy and incompetence, if you read the content of these messages, I think you will come away proud that these are the leaders making these decisions in America.” \n\nSee? Disclosing information that could harm the military and civilians is good—but only when Republicans do it.\n\n25. Said Elon Musk and Trump backing losing candidates is also good\n\nTrump backed the conservative candidate in Wisconsin’s Supreme Court election in April, and the candidate lost. But not in Fox world.\n\nSteve Doocy, co-host of “Fox & Friends” saw a silver lining after the liberal candidate won. “The Democrats ran against Elon Musk, they said he’s the world’s richest man and he can’t buy an election, so it wasn’t about Trump as much as it was about Musk,” Doocy said.\n\nThe election was about both Musk and Trump attempting to influence the state, along with the voter support for a progressive candidate. Doocy’s spin was in direct contrast to reality.\n\n26. Smeared Obama as antisemitic for backing free speech\n\nObama is one of Fox’s favorite targets. Despite him leaving office nearly nine years ago, Fox still relishes a chance to go after the former president.\n\nAfter Obama criticized efforts by the Trump administration to suppress speech in colleges, host Harris Faulkner made a ridiculous leap in logic. “Would that put former President Obama and others in his political camp—by the way, he went to Harvard Law School—you know, pushing against, are they antisemitic?” she asked. \n\nFox has often defended Trump, who traffics in antisemitism, but in the eyes of the network, speech they don’t like is “antisemitic.”\n\n27. Hid its own poll that were bad for Trump\n\nIn spite of their partisan content, Fox has sponsored accurate polls about public sentiment. This fact led to a strange moment in April when Fox’s own poll showed Trump falling to a then-new low approval rating, 44%.\n\nInstead of highlighting its own findings, Fox buried the poll. On “Fox & Friends” and on the Fox website, the network ignored the poor finding for Trump and instead hyped up more favorable findings. Fox showed it is willing to mute even itself in service of the right.\n\n28. Replaced a mild Trump critic with a rabid Trump fan\n\nLongtime Fox host Neil Cavuto used his show to offer up conservative commentary and often misleading pro-conservative content. But he occasionally committed the sin of mildly criticizing Trump.\n\nWhen Cavuto abruptly left the network in December 2024, Fox made sure that wouldn’t happen again. In January, Cavuto was replaced by pro-MAGA commentator Will Cain, a reliably pro-Trump voice who praised the Supreme Court for shutting down affirmative action and called Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who is Black and Muslim, a “parasite.”\n\nThe hire made it clear that anything less than full MAGA support would not be tolerated.\n\n29. Argued it’s okay for Trump to demolish part of the White House since Obama played basketball\n\nThe public outcry after Trump demolished the East Wing of the White House was loud and clear. To defend Trump and his plans for a gold-encrusted ballroom, the White House absurdly claimed that the construction was in line with other past renovations.\n\nFox parroted those talking points, arguing that Trump was justified in his massive construction project because Obama had once modified a tennis court to also be used for basketball. In Fox’s coverage, that slight change was on par with massive destruction. \n\nFox has spent the past year in total spin mode, and it won’t ever stop. The network is happy to be dishonest and ridiculous as long as it can defend Trump, conservatism, and the Republican Party while attacking liberals and the Democrats. This is just what they do.",

        "text": "My own Thanksgiving: I was the guest of Luigi Romaniello, the Waldorf’s managing director, in the hotel’s new Lex Yard restaurant. Just months old, Lex Yard is beyond terrific. Décor, service, menu. As I left, there came an unfamiliar phone caller. She quickly spoke about Victoria Gotti.\n\nHer dad, of course, was gangster John Gotti, who died in prison in ’02. I knew him. We shared lawyer Barry Slotnick. I took Anthony Quinn to Gotti’s trial. Gotti’s playground was nightclubs. My husband worked nightclubs. In New York, Italian restaurateurs would slam a bottle of unrequested red wine on our table with another unrequested “Courtesy of John G.”\n\nI was the only one Gotti spoke to from prison.\n\nIn July ’03 at a party I gave, I reported Victoria’s stilettos were so high she could barely walk in them. In ’08 she was unloading her Long Island home for about $4 million. In ’02 she had open-heart surgery. I knew Victoria Gotti. She lived big.\n\nThe caller said Victoria’s world has changed — and the voice explained they’re calling me because they knew I knew the family. Per the caller, Victoria was in a Long Island hospital awaiting a kidney transplant. Placed in a room for nearly an hour while staff managed the arrival. Victoria, emotional. Devoted son Carmine, who said he would donate his kidney to his mom, stayed with her.\n\nThe telephone lady said Victoria knew word was getting out. A few false callers. Supposedly saying they were her doctors, lawyers, family. At the desk, a nurse quietly said, “She needs to inform her regular doctor that she’s here.” I was told that through tears Victoria said things like: “My son . . . How did I get so blessed with a son like this?”\n\nThanksgiving. People had gone away. Nobody was anywhere. Few reachable through their regular numbers. Nobody in their regular places. I had to leave for dinner. I couldn’t be late. I had no number, nowhere, to call. Nurses wouldn’t say anything. Doctors were on golf courses. I rang the caller’s number back only to learn Victoria had returned to her house.\n\nAn ageless wonder\n\nI receive a crate of emails daily. Some start “Dear Stupid.” One from a political pro. Knows everything. Hears everything. A not wildly brilliant West Side Democrat — like there’s anything else — NOT partial to our president. After our term-limited head of state Donald Trump played catch-ball with Clamdammsy, this letter-writer sent me this: “Could the Donald be setting himself up for a run for mayor? Like when Zohran Mamdani’s term is up? Like maybe exist in antique Gracie Mansion, whose john is even too small for his shoulder pads?” Her thought was: Forget age limits — Donald could outdo Methuselah.\n\nGet it in gear\n\nLooking for holiday gifts? Try cars. Jay Leno likes Stanley Steamers. Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah has 600 Rollses and his car collection is worth $6 billion. Gordon Ramsay cooks in Ferraris. Jerry Seinfeld buys and sells Porsches. Sold part of his collection for $22 mil. And what do stars, like maybe Nicolas Cage, do on the holiday? Nic: “Channel surf. Movie-making is addictive. I’ve been acting since I’m 17. I’m a much better, more approachable person when I’m working. It’s a balancing act between my career and my family. Acting comes out of a place called survival. I’m more balanced when I’m working.” Meanwhile, there’s the NYC roll out of the documentary “The King of Color” on Dec. 12. That’s Larry Herbert, 97, inventor of the Pantone Matching System, followed by Del Frisco’s dinner.\n\nOverheard recently on a city street: “I’m weary of people saying there’s too much crime in our town. It’s gotten so bad that our own bank keeps its money in another bank. So tough that when a friend called the police for help, there was a three-week waiting list.”\n\nOnly in New York, kids, only in New York.",

        "text": "Greetings from the sports desk located somewhere below the main deck of the Good Pirate Ship RedState. Sammy the Shark and Karl the Kraken are, as always, hard at work bringing you the latest sports news …\n\nOr the latest news in fish cracker brands.\n\nAnyway, ‘tis time to turn attention to the NHL. With the season already a tick past a quarter of the way through, definite trends in team performance (or lack thereof) and individual players have become evident. We start by looking at teams.\n\nThe Colorado Avalanche have thus far been the cream of the crop, having, as of the time of this post (November 30, 2025), played 25 games. Total number of losses in regulation? One. That’s scary good. Yet even with this gaudy record, they are leading the Central Division by only six points over the Dallas Stars.\n\nThe most competitive division is the Metropolitan, where the gap between the first-place Carolina Hurricanes and the last-place Columbus Blue Jackets is a slim six points. Speaking of the Metropolitan, the next-to-last-place New York Rangers are currently in one of the more bizarre situations in any sport. On the road, their record is an impressive 11-4-1. At home? 2-8-1. Apparently, they don’t like being in the same city as Zohran Mamdani either.\n\nLooking at some individual players, three names have firmly worked their way into the conversation: New York Islanders defenseman Matthew Schaefer, San Jose Sharks center Macklin Celebrini, and Chicago Blackhawks center Connor Bedard. We’ll start with Bedard, as he is the senior citizen of the trio at the ripe old age of … 20.\n\nBedard currently (November 30, 2025) has 16 goals and 21 assists, his 37 points making him tied for fourth place in scoring. Bedard has carried the Blackhawks into the playoff conversation, although, to be blunt about it, talking about playoffs this early is rather silly.\n\nWay out west, that sound you hear is Los Tiburones de San José swimming back into relevancy in the NHL, thanks in no small part to the exploits of 19-year-old second-year player Celebrini. Presently tied with Bedard in points with 37 (14 goals and 23 assists), Celebrini, along with linemate Will Smith, has turned the Tank into a place once again worth visiting. Also, in the first 20 games of the season, Celebrini amassed 30 points. The only other NHL players to do the same while they were teenagers? Wayne Gretzky, who did it twice; Sidney Crosby, and Mario Lemieux. That’s some mighty fine company.\n\nFinally, the Islanders’ Schaefer. His on-ice efforts have been stellar, with eight goals and 10 assists, leading to a plus-seven rating (translation: while he has been on the ice, New York has scored seven more goals than it has allowed). He is the youngest player — Schaefer is only 18 — to record an overtime winning goal in NHL history. That said, it has been off the ice where Schaefer’s star has shone the brightest. He lost his mother to cancer in 2024 and has devoted himself to lifting up other youth facing similar trials. He skipped his high school graduation to spend the day visiting and comforting kids at the Western New York Compassion Connection.\n\nWhen it comes to the NHL, the kids are all right indeed.\n\nSay, do you enjoy your sports commentary without the diseased rantings of a woke mindset or pseudo-macho wannabe jock posturing seeping around and through the stats and stories?

        "text": "If they go by what the establishment media says, future ages will regard our lucky times as the days when veritable gods in human form walked among us, and lo, their names were Barack and Michelle Obama. The media is unstinting and unembarrassed in its fawning over the sainted couple, no matter how ludicrous its adulation gets. \n\nThese days, Michelle Obama seems determined to test the limits of that ludicrousness, and to push her media sycophants to ever-greater heights of feigned ecstasy at her endless victimhood posturing and mundane pronouncements dressed as wisdom. Her latest book, a heavy $50 coffee-table doorstop entitled The Look, is all about how she became a fashion trendsetter, and look, the easy marks are falling for it, as she knew they would.\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon noted Sunday that The Look “hit stores earlier this month and became an instant bestseller.” As of this Sunday evening, three weeks after its release, it was still number one in Amazon’s Women in History and Black & African American Biographies categories, and number two in Women's Biographies. It’s a big book full of glossy glamor shots of Michelle showing off her alleged trail-blazing fashion sense, but to hear the media tell it, it’s much, much more than just a book about clothes.\n\nThe New York Times grants that it is a “meditation on the power of clothes,” but works hard to make you think it belongs in the literary pantheon, cheek-by-jowl with The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Moby Dick and all the other books with which dead white male authors have plagued English classes: “But most of all,” the Times states rhapsodically, “it is a historical document, capturing a pivotal moment in the evolution of the role of first lady when clothing became an even bigger part of communication. When, in other words, dress became an officially recognized part of the job. That’s a bigger deal than it might appear.” You’ll just have to take the Times’ word on that. \n\nNot to be outdone, the farther-than-far-left Guardian gives us a taste of how Michelle uses The Look to indulge her never-ending desire to portray herself, despite the fantastic success she has enjoyed and immense wealth she has amassed, as a helpless victim of Whitey. “Now,” the Guardian announces, “16 years since Michelle Obama appeared in hers wearing a black sleeveless shift dress from the American designer Michael Kors, the former first lady has spoken about the particular outrage caused by her bare arms. Writing in The Look, a new photo book released on Tuesday that documents her style throughout her time in the White House, Obama describes how the media and public’s ‘fascination’ with her bare arms was used as a tool to ‘otherize’ her.”\n\nGood gravy. Were you ever “fascinated” with Michelle Obama’s bare arms? Neither was I. Do you even know anyone who was “fascinated” with Michelle Obama’s bare arms? Neither do I. But do we both know plenty of leftists who are determined to see racism wherever they look, no matter what is really there? Oh, yes. And here we go again: the Guardian goes on to assert that “although previous first ladies, including Jacqueline Kennedy, had worn sleeveless dresses, Obama notes that they never caused what she calls an ‘uproar’. ‘While I am certainly not the only First Lady to get scrutinized – Hillary was constantly dinged for her preference for pantsuits, and Nancy Reagan was lambasted for her love of haute couture – this felt different.’” Of course it did.\n\nAnd it still does. Farah Jasmine Griffin, who is, like Zohran Mamdani’s father, a Columbia University professor, writes in the book’s foreword that Michelle’s sleeveless outfit at the 2024 Democratic National Convention was more history being made before our very eyes: “The look, like the woman, was bold, powerful, forward-thinking, visionary, and empowering for everyone who dares to believe in the possibility of better tomorrows.”\n\nRelated: Kamala Harris and the Left’s Flight From Decency and Reality\n\nAnd so when we arrive at that better tomorrow, that sunny future of diversity and socialist equity, we will look back on these days when there was one woman of courage, Michelle Obama, with her sleeveless arms revealing her well-toned biceps as she took on the plutocrats and racists (but I am redundant) and destroyed them by the sheer power of her fashion sense.\n\nIs all this twaddle setting Michelle up for a presidential run in 2028? Sure looks like it.\n\nNow through Monday night, you can get 60% OFF on an annual VIP, VIP Gold, or VIP Platinum membership with promo code FIGHT.

        "text": "An influential New York rabbi said he schooled Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on peace in Gaza after his father’s synagogue was targeted by a hateful mob of anti-Israel protesters.\n\nRabbi Marc Schneier, president of The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding and the founding rabbi at The Hamptons Synagogue, said he told Mamdani to his face that he is “out of touch with the greater Muslim world” as leaders of the religion want a two-state solution.\n\n“I said to him, ‘Not only are you out of touch with the Jewish community, you’re out of touch with the greater Muslim world,” Schneier said Sunday on 77 WABC “The Cats Roundtable” radio program.\n\n“You, Mr. Mayor-elect, you refused to recognize Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state,'” he claimed he told Mamdani during an interview with WABC’s John Catsimatidis. Mamdani is a practicing Muslim.\n\nSchneier said he regularly speaks to Muslim leaders across the globe, including in Saudi Arabia and Asia.\n\nMamdani has drawn criticism for supporting the boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign against Israel and his vow to arrest Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for alleged war crimes in Gaza.\n\nSchneier said he would never “bifurcate” anti-Zionism and antisemitism.\n\n“The demonization of Israel will only lead to attacks on Jews like we witnessed last week, particularly when you use antisemitic tropes like genocide, occupation, and apartheid,” the rabbi said.\n\n“I challenged him… from a Muslim-Islamic perspective that he is out of step with the greater Muslim world today that recognizes the Jewish State of Israel. He needs to get on the peace train before it’s too late,” Schneier said.\n\nHe said Mamdani is a product of his father, Columbia University professor Mahmood Mamdani, who has spewed anti-Israel rhetoric and lectures on colonialism.\n\nBut the rabbi appreciated Mamdani for contacting him and backing his idea for legislation to ban protests in front of houses of worship after the troubling mob demonstration at Park East Synagogue in Manhattan.\n\nSchneier’s father, Arthur Schneier, was mobbed by anti-Israel protesters who chanted “globalize the intifada” and sinisterly allegedly urged the “resistance” to “take another settler out.”\n\nSome 200 demonstrators had gathered outside the historical synagogue and heckled Jews attending an event by Nefesh B’nefesh, a Zionist organization that helps Jews immigrate to Israel — including in disputed territories such as the West Bank.\n\nThe NYPD was put on blast for failing to properly patrol the protest, with demonstrators allowed to approach the entrance of the synagogue. Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch personally addressed the synagogue to apologize.\n\nSchneier said he also confronted Mamdani, who is now a state Assemblyman, on legislation to block protests in front of houses of worship.\n\n“‘Why don’t you sponsor legislation that would no longer permit any protests, any demonstrations in front of a house of worship in New York City – whether a synagogue, a church or a mosque?,” Schneier said he asked Mamdani.\n\n“He kept saying, `Rabbi, I love that idea … You have my number. Let’s continue this conversation. Let’s work on this legislation,'” the rabbi claimed.\n\nHe said he’s heartened that Mamdani has contacted him several times since that initial call and that they can have a civil conversation and “agree to disagree.” \n\nA rep from the Mamdani transition repeated a statement saying the mayor-elect was interested in hearing more about Schneier’s pitch on restricting protests in front of houses of worship.",

        "text": "Anti-ICE activists vowed Sunday to continue protesting federal immigration raids in the Big Apple — and refused to apologize for a violent clash with the NYPD at a Lower Manhattan demonstration.\n\nThe proclamation came just one day after the protest against US Immigration & Customs Enforcement agents got out of hand, with cops caught in the middle — and protesters now vowing to keep doing it.\n\n“We do not apologize for standing up,” city Public Advocate Jumaane Williams said at a press conference with members of the New York Immigration Coalition, one day after more than 150 protesters battled with cops outside an ICE deployment center.\n\n“We’ll do it every single time,” Williams vowed. \n\nPolice said Sunday that “multiple individuals were taken into custody” at the out-of-control demonstration outside the US General Services Administration building on Centre Street before noon Saturday that saw police officers called in, only to be bombarded with trash and debris.\n\nCops would not provide more details nor reveal how many were charged, but said cops repeatedly warned the mob to move along, leading to confrontations between the two sides when they refused.\n\nSources said at least 18 of the demonstrators were charged.\n\nProtesters, who descended upon the city over the weekend, converged on a Lower Manhattan parking garage where federal immigration agents were allegedly ready to deploy for an immigration round-up raid, law enforcement sources said.\n\nOn Sunday, advocates called the ongoing raids “horrifying and idiotic.”\n\n“Our neighbors, New Yorkers of every stripe, mobilized, took time out of their day to come here and defend their neighbors to make sure that people were not disappeared, that families were not separated, and stood here for hours,” coalition president and CEO Murad Awawdeh told reporters.\n\nAnother pol at the presser was outgoing city Comptroller Brad Lander, who took issue with the NYPD, claiming they “facilitated ICE deportations.\n\n“I really do want to ask the NYPD to remember who you’re sworn to protect and serve, and it’s the people of New York City,” Lander said. \n\n“And yesterday, the people who were protecting and serving New Yorkers were the protesters who showed up.”\n\nHowever, law enforcement sources told The Post that NYPD brass was less than pleased with New York’s Finest getting caught in the middle of the raucous riot — without a heads-up from the feds.\n\nNYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch allegedly gave the feds a tongue-lashing over the Saturday melee, which saw cops pelted with debris when they tried to step in to protect the ICE agents, sources said.\n\nTisch has agreed to stay on when Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a frequent critic of federal immigration policies under President Trump, takes office after his election victory earlier this month.\n\nFederal authorities have also had to navigate New York’s status as a sanctuary city and policy of not working with ICE on civil arrests and deportations — which runs counter to the Trump administration’s campaign to launch immigration raids throughout the country since taking office.\n\nMeanwhile, immigrant advocates said they’re not going to let up while the raids continue.\n\n“Every time federal officers come into our communities with the intention of conducting lawless raids, of terrorizing our communities, they will be met with non-violent community resistance,” Hannah Stouts, an organizer for Hands Off NYC, said during Sunday’s press conference.",

        "text": "New York City's sanctuary laws prohibit direct cooperation with federal agencies for immigration enforcement. But the NYPD has frequently responded to disruptions surrounding immigration actions and protests.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that it called the NYPD Saturday after “agitators” wearing backpacks, face masks and goggles showed up to block a garage where ICE was located, and after “hundreds of violent rioters\" arrived. It accused people who advertised the ICE officers’ location on social media of putting its officers in danger.\n\n”We will not apologize for stepping up and protecting one another, so I want you to understand what is happening and we'll continue to happen in New York City.” Williams said at Sunday's rally. “We are immensely proud of New Yorkers who stepped up every time ICE agents have come in and tried to abuse our neighbors. And I want to encourage all New Yorkers to continue to do the same.”\n\nThe apparent planned immigration operation in Chinatown would have followed another, in October, where federal authorities said they detained more than a dozen people amid a crackdown targeting counterfeiters. That raid, too, drew large protests, including from several onlookers.\n\nIt also came barely more than a week after Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani — who famously confronted President Donald Trump’s “border czar” Tom Homan in March at the State Capitol — had a surprisingly cordial meeting with Trump at the White House. Mamdani had described the October raid as an “abuse of federal power by the Trump administration: more about fear than justice, more about politics than safety.”\n\nDHS didn’t say in its statement whether it’s expecting further operations in Chinatown.\n\nAwawdeh said that with Saturday’s protest, “New Yorkers stepped up.”\n\n“And New Yorkers defended one another making sure that no one was taken and disappeared from their communities and their families,” he said.",

        "text": "Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton on Sunday said he wants to root out more crime in housing projects — and already warned Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani not to undermine the NYPD’s “preventing policing.’’\n\nThe President Trump appointee said US authorities and prosecutors in general are focusing more on local crime and corruption because federal laws are tougher than regional criminal-justice systems such as New York City’s to put away the bad guys.\n\n“[During] certain weeks, we are positioning our attorneys in precincts around the city where we have the most violent, gun-toting criminals,” Clayton said Sunday on 77 WABC’s the “Cats Roundtable” radio program. “We charge [suspects] federally if we can because there’s a greater likelihood of detention.\n\n“And if we’re able to prove the case, they’re going to get and serve longer sentences,” the US attorney said. “That’s what New York wants. The New York people, they want gun-toting criminals off our street.”\n\nClayton said he advised the lefty Mamdani to let the NYPD continue to do one of the things it does best — “preventative policing — by preserving specialized department units such as the Strategic Response Group that handles counter-terrorism, protests and riots.\n\n“The New York Police Department is the greatest police department in the world. It’s not even close [to others],” Clayton said. “[The NYPD’s] efforts in preventive policing … are so far ahead of the other big city police departments.\n\n“To get rid of preventive policing would be a huge mistake. … You’re not treating people better by pulling back on the police. You actually create more violence scenarios for everyone.”\n\nMamdani has called for disbanding the SRG.\n\nClayton said he’s also looking for his office to help take down other open-air drug markets in the city after the recent crackdown in Washington Square Park — as well as root out gang violence, gun-trafficking and corruption, including in local public housing projects.\n\nClayton discussed the recent federal indictment of 19 suspected narc-dealers operating in Washington Square Park. The feds’ clean-up effort was done in concert with the Drug Enforcement Agency and the NYPD.\n\n“I’m happy to say, with the New York Police Department’s continuing vigilance there, that Washington Square Park is now a park and not a drug den,” Clayton told host John Catsimatidis.\n\nResidents and elected officials have complained about other open-air drug markets, such as The Hub on Third Avenue in the South Bronx and in East Harlem.\n\n“We’re looking for other places around the city … public housing, parks, well-known thoroughfares where that type of operation should be brought. … It’s a quality-of-life matter,” Clayton said. \n\n“You can’t have safety if you have open-air drug dealing.”\n\nClayton, who Trump appointed US attorney for the Southern District encompassing Manhattan, The Bronx and the city’s northern suburbs, also said he’s trying to clean up corruption and violence at the New York City Housing Authority complexes.\n\nHe noted that 70 NYCHA employees who were arrested and charged last year in a massive corruption case have pleaded guilty or were convicted of bribery, fraud or extortion offenses. The initial bust last year was the largest single-day bribery takedown in the Justice Department’s history.\n\n“That’s another area where the federal government is stepping in. We’re trying to stamp out corruption in the Housing Authority,” he said of the city’s $13 billion agency.\n\nHe also complained there’s too much junk justice with the state’s cashless bail laws, lax judges and local district attorneys who put criminals back out on the streets.\n\n“If somebody’s going to get a sentence of one year or two years for a violent crime, they are very unlikely to cooperate and help prosecutors and law enforcement to find the other participants in the violent crime,” Clayton said. \n\n“If they’re facing 10 years, they are likely to help us [to] get more criminals off the streets. There are knock-on effects to these very light sentences that are truly problematic for public safety.\n\n“All New Yorkers should ask themselves, ‘Do we want judges who are worried about public safety?’ I think New Yorkers do. And I think our officials, including the new mayor, should hear from New Yorkers that we want a focus on public safety, and career violent criminals should not be on our streets. … We do not want to go back to where things were in 1975.”",

        "text": "Democratic Tennessee congressional candidate Aftyn Behn on Sunday defended her past alienating comments by noting she was a “private citizen” when she made them.\n\nIn 2020, Behn claimed she hated a number of features associated with the city of Nashville on the “Year old GRITS” podcast and also wrote anti-police tweets. On CNN’s “Inside Politics Sunday,” host Manu Raju asked Behn if she regretted making those statements. (RELATED: ‘He Was Sending Seniors To Their Death’: Socialist Zohran Mamdani Downplays Anti-Police Tweets)\n\n“Some of your past tweets have gotten attention, including in 2020 when you posted, then deleted a post that said, ‘good morning, especially to the 54% of Americans that believe burning down a police station is justified.’ In another you appear supportive of a demand to ‘Defund the police.’ Do you regret posting those comments?” Raju asked.\n\n“Yeah, I said that during the George Floyd moment when the entire country was demanding accountability and safer policing. And what I’ve always believed is that communities need investment — they need investment to be safe,” Behn said. “They need investment in mental health responders, first responders, and youth programs to reduce that crime. And I was a private citizen back then, and now I’m a lawmaker.”\n\nShe added that her constituents want safety and increased affordability and that she was focused on those issues.\n\n“So should you not have posted those?” Raju pressed.\n\n“Like I said, I’m a lawmaker now. And so I wouldn’t post things like that now and haven’t, because I’ve definitely matured,” Behn asserted.\n\nRaju also questioned Behn on her remarks about despising Nashville.\n\n“I hate the city, I hate the bachelorettes, I hate the pedal taverns, I hate country music, I hate all of the things that make Nashville apparently an ‘it’ city to the rest of the country. But I hate it,” Behn said on the “Year old GRITS” podcast.\n\nRaju then asked Behn if she believed her comments were a “mistake.”\n\n“Once again, I was a private citizen. Nashville is my home. Do I roll my eyes at the bachelorette parties and the pedal taverns that are blocking my access to my house? Yeah, every Nashvillian does,” she said. “But this race has always been about something bigger. It’s about families across Middle Tennessee that are getting crushed by rising prices while Washington politicians and billionaires argue about this type of nonsense.”\n\nBehn also labeled Tennessee a “racist state” in a 2019 op-ed for the Tennessean.\n\n“Let me be clear: Tennessee is a racist state. Racism is in the air we breathe, permeating the State Capitol, codified in the legislation being passed at the detriment of women, communities of color, and the working poor,” she wrote. “Our problem with racism in this state is wild and untamed.”\n\nBehn is campaigning to represent Tennessee’s 7th district, which will hold a special election Tuesday in response to Republican Tennessee Rep. Mark Green’s July 4, 2025 resignation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

        "text": "Darkness matters, too.\n\nTo quote Doctor Who, “You can always judge a man by the quality of his enemies.”\n\nIt’s a dynamic pro wrestling figured out long ago: In a “sport” that’s 100% built on storytelling and manufactured emotions, promoters learned that it’s not enough just to have a super-popular champion. That’s not the secret to drawing big crowds and huge money.\n\nYou also need a worthy villain.\n\nFew wrestlers in history could rival Hulk Hogan’s popularity in the 1980s. But as uniquely popular as the Hulkster was, he couldn’t sell out the Pontiac Silverdome on his own.\n\nHe needed a villain: the monstrous Andre the Giant.\n\nWhen they met in WrestleMania III, up to 93,173 fans were in attendance. It was the classic storytelling formula: hero in jeopardy + unbeatable villain = drama.\n\nThe audience ate it up with a spoon. \n\n(The Hulkster won with a bodyslam, by the way.)\n\nAnd this brings us to President Donald Trump, the Republican Party, and the MAGA movement, circa the tail end of 2025. If you haven’t noticed, the GOP is on its heels. We lost badly on Election Day 2025, and Trump’s current polling numbers are going in the wrong direction.\n\nWho’s our common enemy?\n\nDon’t simply say, “It’s the Democrats.” That’s already baked into the cake. In a two-party system, it’s ALWAYS gotta be one or the other.\n\nWe need more than that.\n\nOver the past few decades, Republican have — temporarily, at least — embraced all kinds of different, far-reaching missions. And each mission had at least one great enemy: There was the Cold War mission (bad guys: Russians, commies, and “useful idiots”). There was the Reagan Revolution mission (bad guys: country club Republicans, RINOs, and non-conservatives). There was the post-9/11 mission (bad guys: radical Islam and/or “the Axis of Evil.”). There was the Tea Party mission (bad guys: government waste, bloat, and debt).\n\nThen, of course, came the MAGA mission (bad guys: politicians and policies that put “America Last” instead of “America First”). \n\nBut the MAGA mission has been around for over 10 years now. Donald Trump has either been running for president — or living in the White House — every day since June 16, 2015. And in some ways, he’s a victim of his success. He’s already closed the border, stopped illegal immigration, and reversed countless “America Last” policies.\n\nAnd today, the globalists are no longer the biggest threat to America’s well-being.\n\nWe’re seeing the rise of a new Democratic Party. There’s AOC in congress and Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in New York City. After Charlie Kirk’s murder, leftists were more concerned with Jimmy Kimmel’s “right” to entertain dozens on late-night TV than the most shocking political assassination on American soil since Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian sympathizer, killed Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nSpeaking of Palestine, for today’s liberals, the great moral quandary of our age is how to “Free Palestine” from the evil Zionists. Gender identities might be fluid, but devout anti-Zionism is their new North Star.\n\nSo on and so forth.\n\nPolitical movements aren’t static; they’re constantly evolving, continually changing. When our enemies change, we must change with them.\n\nAdapt or die. Pivot or perish.\n\nOtherwise, we’ll be left behind.\n\nBesides, I’ve noticed that the GOP does better when we’re united by a big mission — and a big, scary, threatening enemy. Without one, we turn on each other and cannibalize our own.\n\nWhich is exactly what we’re seeing today, with the Groyper + Tucker Carlson + Candace Owens triumvirate battling everyone else. It’s destructive and stupid, and the rest of MAGA needs to nip it in the bud — or it WILL spiral out of control.\n\nThe clock is ticking.\n\nTomorrow, I’ll offer new ideas on a MAGA PR pivot: A new “common enemy” to re-unite our movement, realigning it to match the ethos of today’s biggest danger.\n\nBut until then, please share your thoughts in the comments. If you believe MAGA needs a new common enemy, whom should we target?\n\nLord knows there’s no shortage of candidates.\n\n(Here, our cup spilleth over.)\n\nI’m curious how the PJ Media VIP audience sees the problem — as well as the opportunity.\n\nPRedictions: The economy is in far better shape than the media is telling you. Although the ultimate fate of the U.S. economy — and the GOP’s chances in the 2026 midterms — will depend on the so-called “A.I. bubble” being a misnomer, we received excellent news the day after Turkey Day.\n\nEven the New York Times admitted it (although they phrased it as negatively as they could): “U.S. Black Friday Sales Defy Tariffs and Economic Woes.”\n\nThat’s the Times’ way of acknowledging that Black Friday retail sales increased by 4%. Nearly $12 billion was spent on digital purchases.\n\nJust a few days prior, the Financial Times predicted “US Black Friday shoppers expected to spend less as cost of living bites.” (Whoops.)\n\nTypically, when a Republican is in the White House, the media seeks stories of economic pain and devastation. (And then, when a Democrat takes over, those stories vanish in an instant: Good times are back!)\n\nIt was a phenomenon that Rush Limbaugh loved to lampoon, especially when it came to the homeless: Somehow, all the homeless people seemed to vanish whenever the Dems returned to the White House.\n\nStill, this economic news wasn’t just a ray of sunshine amidst the winter doldrums. The GOP needs a strong, successful economy to stave off a 2026 Blue Wave. If the American people lose faith in the Republicans’ capacity to steer the financial ship, the gig is up.\n\nAnd the final two years of Trump’s presidency will be mired in impeachment hearings, subpoenas, and phony investigations. I guarantee it.\n\nHad the opposite happened — and Black Friday sales tanked — it’d be too much to overcome. More than the Thanksgiving turkey would be cooked.\n\nWhat we have, boys and girls, is a legitimate reason for hope and optimism.\n\nPRojections: That’s because there’s a lag between the “economic reality” and “public sentiment.” They don’t move at the same start time.\n\nThe economic reality is like a very long train, and public sentiment is the caboose: It takes a while for the public to catch up.\n\nWhether they believe the economy is good, bad, or something in between, public sentiment is always a lagging indicator.\n\nRight now, in opinion poll after opinion poll, the public has a negative feeling about the economy. They believe prices are still too high — and basic necessities are no longer affordable.\n\nAnd even if the economy takes off like a rocket ship, Joe Six-Pack won’t feel it right away. \n\nIt’ll take him half a year.\n\nFor PR, at least, the phrase “trickle-down economics” is exactly right: It takes time for the caboose to feel the momentum.\n\nBut once it starts moving, it also takes a lot to slow it down.\n\nSo let’s hope the 2025 holiday shopping season helps kickstart a new age of American prosperity. Because, if it does, the rest of the country will feel it by summer 2026. Come June or July, Americans will be feeling very positive about their future.\n\nAnd that’ll put the GOP back in the driver’s seat for the Nov. 2026 midterms.\n\nPRaise: To the West Virginian National Guardsmen who, according to their governor, are asking to honor their fallen servicemembers by continuing to patrol the streets of D.C.\n\nPer CBS News: “No West Virginia National Guard troops deployed in D.C. have asked to leave since deadly shooting, governor says”\n\nGov. Patrick Morrisey said Friday that no West Virginia National Guard members deployed to Washington, D.C., have requested to return home in the wake of Wednesday's shooting of two West Virginia Guard members that left one dead and the second critically wounded.\"I haven't heard of anyone step back,\" Morrisey told CBS News in an interview. \"They wanted to stay. They wanted to complete the mission and serve their state and country.\"\n\nGood. Walking away from evil invites more of it.\n\nI was raised in a military family. My father is a retired lieutenant colonial. But until my son joined the Army Cavalry, I didn’t appreciate the emotional commitment.\n\nI guess it’s because it never occurred to me that anything could hurt my dad. He was big and strong when I was small and weak. I depended on him to keep me safe, and he never gave me a reason to doubt his commitment.\n\nBut it’s my job to keep my boys safe. It’s ALL our jobs to keep our kids safe! It’s our most solemn responsibility as parents.\n\nI’ve kissed enough boo-boos (and made enough emergency room visits) to know how vulnerable our children are. We owe them so much more than this!\n\nImporting mentally unstable Afghan nationals into our country is madness.\n\nIt’s getting people killed.\n\nPRedators: It’s gotta be Rahmanullah Lakanwal, the Afghan immigrant who shot a pair of National Guardsmen. One of them, Sarah Beckstrom, age 20, has already passed away.\n\nAnd I know we’ve Epstein’d ourselves into backing all kinds of kooky conspiracy theories. Believing in outlandish, far-reaching conspiracies has gone mainstream in certain MAGA-aligned circles, alas.\n\nSo it was only a matter of time:\n\nURGENT Is the CIA behind the murder of two US soldiers near the White House? Did they direct/orchestrate this act of war? Take a close look at the gunman’s ID card below - acc to this he was a member of the Qandahar Strike Force, a CIA-backed paramilitary unit. He’s one of theirs pic.twitter.com/anKD3JrkQS— Lara Logan (@laralogan) November 27, 2025 \n\nGET THIS…😳😳😳Rahmanullah Lakanwal, the name of the dude who killed two National Guard soldiers today, and was subsequently given asylum status by the Trump Administration actually “served alongside U.S. Special Forces in Afghanistan” for 10 YEARS.Because, OF COURSE he… pic.twitter.com/MY8ZMuxzMc— The Patriot Voice (@TPV_John) November 27, 2025\n\nLook, I get that speculating about some conspiracies is fun: For all I know, maybe there really are dead aliens in Area 51.\n\nI doubt it, but I can’t rule it out.\n\nBut not everything is a conspiracy. They’re the exception, not the rule.\n\nMost of the time, a cigar is just a cigar.\n\nAnd when the blood of a young American patriot like Sarah Beckstrom is spilled, we owe her — and her family — more than speculation and innuendo. It’s not fair to cheapen her death by transforming it into conspiratorial gobbledygook.\n\nOr as a way for untalented “influencers” to generate social media clicks. It’s cruel and gross.\n\nIf you wanna let your imagination run wild over aliens in Area 51, have at it. Believe in aliens and spaceships if you want.\n\nBut until you have something more substantive than baseless theories and rampant speculations, SHUT THE [expletive] UP and let Beckstrom’s family mourn the senseless death of a beautiful, brave 20-year-old American girl with dignity and peace.\n\nAnd go play “conspiracy” somewhere else.",

        "text": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nLabubus, Dubai chocolate, Sydney Sweeney—these are just a few, let’s say, concepts that everyone on the internet collectively learned recently, and, as is our wont, proceeded to drive into the ground. It’s a familiar pattern, a topic quickly going from unknown to ubiquitous to exhausting, and it usually plays out with cultural trends and ephemera—which is why it’s so odd that I’m currently wondering if it might also apply to a phase of reproductive health.\n\n“Perimenopause” is the term for the years leading up to menopause, a time when women may experience symptoms like changes in their menstrual cycles, moods, sleep, and more, symptoms that, traditionally, haven’t been widely spoken about (and can vary considerably from person to person). I know I brought up Labubus, but that doesn’t mean I think perimenopause is a trend—its existence is a scientific fact, not something that can be switched out for another keychain. And yet, over the last few years perimenopause has undeniably become strangely … popular? As in, if I would ever be so crass as to dub something the Labubu of women’s health concepts, perimenopause would have to be it.\n\nHow did we get here, to the point where almost every day, there’s a new trend piece or study about perimenopause, with the Washington Post designing quizzes to test your peri-IQ and McSweeney’s running its own, less earnest quizzes? Last year, there was even a hot perimenopause novel. Tech and other types of companies have been trying to stake a claim in the perimenopause space as well, which has resulted in the founding of telehealth and vitamin startups and various Goop-y products like oils, gels, or a wearable tracker specifically for perimenopause symptoms.\n\nIt’s curious, this inescapability. During the first few months of the pandemic in 2020, I remember getting a kick out of a TikTok of comedian Jordan Firstman pretending to be a triumphant publicist representing banana bread (“We did it, bitch, the plan fucking worked!”), and lately I keep having the silly thought that it’s like perimenopause hired banana bread’s publicist. It was just everywhere all of a sudden, like Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral election, or Timothée Chalamet in an Oscar campaign. Perimenopause saw a marked spike in awareness and interest around 2022, climbing sharply in recent years and to a high in the past couple of months, according to Google. There were high-profile advocacy campaigns, celebrity pushes by figures like Queen Latifah and Drew Barrymore, and the subsequent money rush. Perimenopause obviously did not hire one particularly effective publicist, but it did experience a comms person’s dream scenario of “earned media” seemingly all at once.\n\nHowever this public relations blitz came together, is it possible it worked too well? I’m just wondering how many more times I’ll encounter the sentiment that “nobody tells you” about perimenopause now that so many somebodies have. And do I personally even need to be worried about perimenopause? If all this awareness of it is just giving women in their 20s and 30s one more thing to worry about, what’s the good in that?\n\nI voiced some of these anxieties to Lauren Tetenbaum, a New York–based psychotherapist specializing in women’s life transitions and the author of the book Millennial Menopause: Preparing for Perimenopause, Menopause, and Life’s Next Period, and she reframed some of them for me. She pointed out that many women treat perimenopause, which typically begins in their late 30s or early 40s and can last for a decade, as not so much an additional thing to worry about but a new way to worry about things you might already be worrying about, such as aging and fertility. In her experience working with and speaking to women, “They associate menopause or perimenopause with aging. They’ll say things like, ‘Oh, I’m nowhere near that.’ I just heard that the other day, and the woman was 48. It’s like, ‘You are though.’ It’s a life phase, it’s not a disease.”\n\nMonica Christmas, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Chicago and associate medical director for the Menopause Society, told me that as her patients’ awareness of perimenopause has increased, so have misconceptions. “What I’ve noticed more recently is that the information isn’t correct, and that’s almost worse than no information at all,” she said. “Everything isn’t perimenopause. Right now, everybody believes every symptom that they have, it has to be perimenopause.”\n\nRobin Noble, the chief medical officer at the nonprofit organization Let’s Talk Menopause, acknowledged that the increasing prominence of perimenopause can be a “double-edged sword”: “Being clued into that can be healthy, but it can also increase people’s anxieties.”\n\nChristmas said she sometimes fields requests from people wondering if they can simply opt out of perimenopause altogether. “I’m getting a lot of people that are in their 30s that just want to skip it. That’s not possible. I always think, ‘So are you asking me what the antidote to aging is?’ ” She said she asks those patients to explain what in particular they’re afraid of, so they can try to address that.\n\nSo it seems possible peak perimenopause is not here yet, and there are still plenty more people to reach. Still, there’s reason to be wary of the so-called menopause gold rush, with its lack of regulation and high risk for exploitation. Christmas said she worries about companies creating hysteria and undermining doctors. She also is concerned with the way algorithms can push some of these products and ideas. “You may not even realize that in between the cute pet videos that you look at, you also are getting inundated with people talking about perimenopause and in ways that may not be very helpful, like you need this estrogen cream to put on your face, or you need these probiotics.”\n\nAs delusional as it may be, I understand the patients Christmas mentioned who are hoping they’ll magically be exempt from the whole thing. As Emma Rosenblum put it in an Elle essay, “knowing that we’re entering this process, and all that goes with it, doesn’t exactly feel great.” But ultimately, it does seem better to have a slightly better understanding of what the lead-up to menopause might look like. Aging may not always feel like a gift, but I wouldn’t trade it, not even for a 24-karat gold Labubu.",

        "text": "In the wake of last year's tumultuous presidential election, which exhausted many Americans, it was expected to be quiet on the 2025 campaign trail. But with President Donald Trump back in the White House and Democrats itching to rebound after last year's ballot box setbacks, 2025's off-year elections were anything but sedate. Here are five of the biggest moments that shaped the campaign trail. 5. Democrats overperform in special elections Just eight days into Trump's second term in the White House, demoralized Democrats had something to cheer about. SETTING THE STAGE: WHAT THE 2025 ELECTIONS SIGNAL FOR NEXT YEAR'S MIDTERM SHOWDOWNS Democrat Mike Zimmer defeated Republican Katie Whittington in a special state Senate election in Iowa, flipping a Republican-controlled vacant seat in a district that Trump had carried by 21 points less than three months earlier. Zimmer's victory triggered a wave of Democrats overperforming in special elections and regularly scheduled off-year ballot box contests. In Iowa, Democrats in August flipped another Republican-held seat in a state Senate special election, breaking the GOP's supermajority in the upper chamber for the first time in three years. \"Since the president was inaugurated back in January, there's been 45 elections on the ballot. Democrats have overperformed in all of them to the tune of about 16 percentage points on average,\" Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin touted in a Fox News Digital interview days ahead of the 2025 elections. 4. Inflation persists, making affordability issue No. 1 on the campaign trail It was the issue that boosted Trump and Republicans in the 2024 elections, as they won back the White House and Senate majority and kept control of the House. But a year later, the economy, and everyday expenses in particular, are working against the president and his party in the 2025 elections. FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS SAY WHITE HOUSE IS DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD ON ECONOMY Democrats, with an across-the-board focus on affordability, enjoyed sweeping success at the ballot box earlier this month, with double-digit victories in the gubernatorial showdowns in blue-leaning but competitive New Jersey and Virginia, as well as major victories in high-profile contests in battlegrounds Georgia and Pennsylvania and solidly blue New York City and California. \"Voters are remarkably consistent in their priorities: the economy, the economy, the economy,\" noted Wayne Lesperance, a veteran political scientist and president of New England College. \"When you win an election, voters expect you are going to do something to address those concerns and the reality is that the questions of affordability remain unchanged in their importance to the everyday voter.\" 3. Jay Jones text messages revealed, rocking the Virginia elections Virginia Democrats were cruising toward convincing victories in the commonwealth's statewide elections when a scandal sent shockwaves up and down the ballot. Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones instantly went into crisis mode after controversial texts were first reported earlier by the National Review in early October. Jones acknowledged and apologized for texts he sent in 2022, when he compared then-Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert to mass murderers Adolf Hitler and Pol Pot, adding that if he was given two bullets, he would use both against the GOP lawmaker to shoot him in the head. But Jones faced a chorus of calls from Republicans to drop out of the race. KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE 2025 ELECTIONS And the GOP leveraged the explosive revelations up the ballot, forcing Democratic Party nominee, former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, back on defense in a campaign where she was seen as the frontrunner against Republican rival Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. Earle-Sears didn't waste an opportunity to link Spanberger to Jones. And during last month's chaotic and only gubernatorial debate, where Earle-Sears repeatedly interrupted Spanberger, the GOP gubernatorial nominee called on her Democratic rival to tell Jones to end his attorney general bid. \"The comments that Jay Jones made are absolutely abhorrent,\" Spanberger said at the debate. But she neither affirmed nor pulled back her support of Jones. While the scandal grabbed national headlines, in the end it didn't slow down the Democrats, as Spanberger crushed Earle-Sears by 15 points. Democrats won the separate election for lieutenant governor by 11 points and Jones even pulled off a 6-point victory over Republican incumbent Jason Miyares. 2. Trump urges Texas to redistrict Aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections, Trump in June first floated the idea of rare but not unheard of mid-decade congressional redistricting. The mission was simple: redraw congressional district maps in red states to pad the GOP's razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats. Trump's first target: Texas. A month later, when asked by reporters about his plan to add Republican-leaning House seats across the country, the president said, \"Texas will be the biggest one. And that’ll be five.\" The push by Trump and his political team triggered a high-stakes redistricting showdown with Democrats to shape the 2026 midterm landscape in the fight for the House majority. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas called a special session of the GOP-dominated state legislature to pass the new map. ELECTION REFLECTION: 'DEMOCRATS FLIPPED THE SCRIPT' ON AFFORDABILITY IN BALLOT BOX SHOWDOWNS But Democratic state lawmakers, who broke quorum for two weeks as they fled Texas in a bid to delay the passage of the redistricting bill, energized Democrats across the country. Among those leading the fight against Trump's redistricting was Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California. California voters earlier this month overwhelmingly passed Proposition 50, a ballot initiative which will temporarily sidetrack the left-leaning state's nonpartisan redistricting commission and return the power to draw the congressional maps to the Democratic-dominated legislature. That is expected to result in five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts in California, which aimed to counter the move by Texas to redraw their maps. Meanwhile, an opinion by two federal judges in Texas this month delivered a blow to Trump and Republicans, by ruling that the state can't use the newly drawn map in next year's elections. Texas Republicans say they'll appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. But the fight has spread beyond Texas and California. Right-tilting Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio have drawn new maps as part of the president's push. And red-leaning Indiana, Florida and Kansas are also mulling redrawing their maps. \"We must keep the Majority at all costs,\" Trump wrote on social media this month. Illinois and Maryland, two blue states, and Virginia, where Democrats control the legislature, are also taking steps or seriously considering redistricting. And in a blow to Republicans, a Utah district judge this month rejected a congressional district map drawn up by the state's GOP-dominated legislature and instead approved an alternate that will create a Democratic-leaning district ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. 1. Mamdani wins NYC mayoral primary Zohran Mamdani's convincing June 24 victory in New York City's Democratic Party mayoral primary was the political earthquake that rocked the nation's most populous city and sent powerful shockwaves across the country. The capturing of the Democratic nomination by the now-34-year-old socialist state lawmaker over frontrunner former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and nine other candidates propelled Mamdani to this month's general election victory. While Mamdani's 9-point general election victory is a shot in the arm for the rise of the socialist movement as it battles moderate Democrats for the future of the party, it also appears to be the political gift that keeps on giving for Republicans, as they aim to paint all Democrats as far-left radicals. The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) was one of the first out of the gate to capitalize on the leftward lurch, firing off an email release minutes after Mamdani's primary victory, arguing that \"every vulnerable House Democrat will own him, and every Democrat running in a primary will fear him.\" And this month, immediately after Mamdani became mayor-elect, the NRCC claimed \"the new face of the Democrat Party just dropped, and it's straight out of a socialist nightmare.\" But Trump's very chummy meeting with Mamdani recently at the White House seemed to undercut the GOP strategy to use the mayor-elect as a human cudgel. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Democrats insist that the effort to link Mamdani is a distraction from Republicans' inability to deal with the affordability issue. \"Republican operatives in D.C. know they can’t win on the issues, so we’re seeing them melt down in real time, resorting to ineffective boogeyman attacks. It’s embarrassing,\" the rival Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee charged.",

        "text": "Two U.S. House Republicans from Arizona are urging President Donald Trump to deny New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani a federal security clearance, a credential typically given to the head of the nation's biggest city.\n\nReps. Andy Biggs and Eli Crane are among eight Republicans accusing Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist whom Trump last week warmly welcomed to the White House, of \"a well-documented record of conduct that raises serious national security concerns.\"\n\nA letter signed by Biggs and Crane notes Mamdani co-founded a chapter of the youth pro-Palestinian group, Students for Justice in Palestine, his previous remarks calling to defund New York police, and, while campaigning, declined to condemn the phrase \"Globalize the Intifada,\" among other actions they deem disqualifying for a security clearance.\n\n“Security clearances are reserved for individuals who can be trusted with the nation’s most sensitive materials — a standard Mamdani doesn’t come close to meeting,\" Biggs said in a written statement. \"His record is a bold red warning flag. DHS (the Department of Homeland Security) must reject his request without hesitation.”\n\nBiggs and Crane are sticking to that demand even after a surprisingly friendly meeting between Trump and Mamdani that saw the two men genially take questions from the press and hold a photo shoot in the White House.\n\nThe president, who had previously referred to the mayor-elect as a \"communist lunatic\" and suggested he may be in the country illegally, waved away a question asking Mamdani whether he still considers Trump a \"fascist.\"\n\n\"That's OK. You can just say yes,\" Trump said. \"I don't mind.\"\n\nMamdani had told reporters earlier: “It was a productive meeting focused on a place of shared admiration and love, which is New York City, and the need to deliver affordability to New Yorkers.”\n\n\"We agree on a lot more than I would have thought,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump, an exceptional figure in American politics, has come to enjoy a striking degree of loyalty from the GOP rank-and-file. His volatile leadership style can at times create uncomfortable circumstances for other Republican elected officials, who regularly defend his decisions and statements even when they are outlandish, seemingly contradictory, or politically risky.\n\nThrough an aide, Biggs, who is running for governor of Arizona, didn't answer a question about whether it was a mistake for Trump to warmly receive someone who Biggs believes \"has a well-established pattern of siding with extremists, undermining U.S. counterterrorism efforts, demonizing law enforcement, and legitimizing violent movements.\"\n\nInstead, Biggs took the opportunity to criticize how the state's economy is shaping up under Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat.\n\n\"President Trump is working to deliver lower costs for Americans and as a true statesman, he's willing to work with elected officials from across the political spectrum to get the job done,\" Biggs said in a written statement. Hobbs \"should take a lesson from President Trump and start putting people ahead of politics.\"\n\nThe visit didn't change \"any of the underlying issues,\" such as Mamdani's \"views, affiliations, and actions,\" wrote Greg Smith, Crane's chief of staff.\n\nThe White House and Mamdani's team did not return requests for comment.\n\nIt's typical for New York City mayors to have security clearances, which allow them to be briefed on threats to the city, Politico has reported.\n\nTrump has previously used security clearances as a way to target his political enemies. In March, he announced he was prohibiting a list of top Democrats and other rivals, including former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Rep. Liz Cheney and New York Attorney General Letitia James, from accessing classified information.\n\nBut he's given no indication that he plans to do the same for Mamdani. It would mark an escalation in their relationship which, days ago, seemed friendly.\n\nWhat we know: Kyrsten Sinema, psychedelic advocate, now a devotee of RFK's agenda?",

        "text": "New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's smile carried him a long way toward being elected. And he used his affability again on Friday, turning the meeting he had requested with President Donald Trump into an Oval Office lovefest.\n\n Now it's time for the mayor-elect to employ the power of smiling to make day-to-day life better for New Yorkers when they are compelled to interact with city employees. Mamdani needs to call on the 300,000 city employees to show warmth, respect and courtesy to the public. The spirit of a smile.\n\n Walk into a city agency or court building seeking help, and you're likely to get barked at and herded like a dumb animal. Ask a Metropolitan Transportation Authority employee why the train isn't coming, and you're apt to hear, \"Can't you read the sign?\" followed by a muttered \"dumb f--k.\" It's a bruising experience.\n\n I went to family court at 111 Centre Street last Thursday to be appointed as a guardian for a 95-year-old woman bed-bound in a nursing home. Arriving at the appointed time of 9:30 a.m., I found 80 people, in a line snaking around the outside of the building, waiting to enter and go through the one available metal scanner.\n\n I inched ahead in the line until I was third from the entrance. A burly man in a guard uniform suddenly came through the door, held his arm horizontally in front of me, and yelled an order for all of us to turn around and proceed to the entrance at the back of the building. Everyone who had made it to the front of the line would now be at the back of the line. I calmly said \"no,\" and that I had waited once and would like to enter, and I started to walk around him to the door. He held his arm out to stop me and barked his order again, adding, \"Do you think you're someone special?\"\n\n \"Yes,\" I replied, adding below my breath, \"We are human beings.\" I pushed my way around him and into the building, taking the two women behind me in as well.\n\n The fact is, everyone in that line deserved dignified treatment -- but that's not the treatment being meted out by employees at 111 Centre Street.\n\n When I got upstairs, I took a seat outside Judge Ilana Marcus' courtroom. Noon arrived, and I still hadn't been called. I pulled open the courtroom door a crack to see if the elderly patient's case was still being discussed.\n\n At that point, a court guard pushed through the door, screamed at me for opening the door, and refused to answer any questions about whether I was even in the right hallway. When I tried to speak, she shut me down.\n\n That's how people too often are treated in city agencies and courtrooms. And it's reflected in the low ratings New Yorkers give city services. Only 27% rate them overall good or excellent, reports the Citizens Budget Commission, though New Yorkers give high ratings to fire protection and garbage collection.\n\n But if you want to see nastiness, visit the McCarren public pool in Brooklyn. As one swimmer commented, \"The attendants in the ladies room are definitely from a prison movie.\"\n\n The quality of public services and their delivery were barely mentioned in the many months of mayoral campaigning, with the candidates battling instead over Trump and the fate of Gaza.\n\n To the extent Mamdani discussed quality of life in the city, he reduced it to one word: \"dignity.\" He said, \"A life of dignity should not be reserved for the fortunate few.\"\n\n But he talked about only one way of restoring dignity: the government's role in helping working people afford child care or a decent place to live.\n\n \"No New Yorker should ever be priced out of anything they need to survive. ... It is government's job to deliver that dignity.\"\n\n Child care and groceries cost money, but on day one, Mamdani can go a long way toward helping New Yorkers feel dignified in this hardscrabble city by asking them to be treated with civility.\n\n Mamdani should announce a dignity campaign, calling on public employees to treat all of us with civility instead of herding us like animals and barking instructions at us.\n\n He should take a page out of the 99th mayor's playbook. Former Mayor Fiorello La Guardia approached a group of city officials incognito and waited while they ignored him. When one of them finally said something, La Guardia shouted back, \"Take off your hat when you speak to a citizen,\" as he knocked the hat off the worker's head.\n\n Today, that would be going too far. Working rules forbid it. But in the 1990s, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani also called for more civility from public employees.\n\n The New York City Police Department had its \"Courtesy, Professionalism, Respect\" motto. That should be the code of conduct citywide.\n\n Target is mandating that its in-store workers smile and make eye contact with shoppers. That's good business. Customers have options.\n\n New Yorkers sometimes find themselves with no option but to walk into a courtroom, or into a city agency to apply for a permit. But they should get the same courteous treatment as customers with options.\n\n Launching a civility campaign and putting some energy behind it could help dispel the skepticism and dread many New Yorkers feel about the incoming Mamdani.\n\n Put that grin to work, Mr. Mayor.\n\n Betsy McCaughey is a former Lt.

        "text": "Thanksgiving is a uniquely American paradox: a holiday built on gratitude and togetherness that is adored for the food and maligned for the table drama, practically in the same breath.\n\nAs it turns out, Thanksgiving is also the most Gen Z of holidays.\n\nGeneration Z includes people born between 1996 and 2010, meaning they’re 15-29 years old. And according to Resy, an online reservation company, 90% of Gen Zers surveyed like sitting at shared tables – more than other generations by far.\n\nResy concluded that in this era of digital fatigue, young people are craving these “in real life” experiences. Half of respondents said they’ve had interesting conversations “with someone I otherwise wouldn’t have” while dining at a communal table.\n\nSure, Thanksgiving is a little different – and typically not a table full of strangers – but in my own unscientific study on Thursday, Gen Z (my nieces and nephews) was well-represented and highly engaged. I didn’t see a single phone on the table.\n\nMy Gen Z daughter hosted a gathering of friends, and friends of friends, to celebrate the holiday. It’s gained international popularity, according to The Guardian: 42% of Gen Z living in the U.K. said they have attended or hosted Thanksgiving dinner, while 16% said they would do so for the first time this year.\n\nThe desire of this generation to build real-life community goes beyond their dining preferences. It shaped and stoked the campaign to elect Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York City.\n\nWriting in The New York Times, Emma Goldberg and Benjamin Oreskes described it this way: “Addicted to their screens, strapped for cash, spiritually unmoored and socially stunted by the pandemic, young New Yorkers needed a reason to get out of the house. They found it in Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral run.”\n\nThe campaign was as much about socializing as mobilizing. There was a scavenger hunt, a soccer tournament, do-it-yourself Mamdani merchandise (“merch”) parties, and $5 beer nights where supporters could gather to debrief, after knocking on doors. Mamdani joined the revelry and hyped up the crowds.\n\nAs Goldberg and Oreskes observed, “the social buoyancy of his campaign wasn’t just for show. Young people turned up and voted.” Nearly 100,000 of them cast early ballots, lowering the median age of this voting bloc from 55 in 2021 to 50. And turnout overall was 84% higher than in 2021, a level of participation not seen since 1969.\n\nI’ve written on occasion about the seminal book by Robert Putnam called “Bowling Alone,” which was first published 25 years ago. Putnam examined the slide in U.S. electoral participation in the decades since 1960. He correlated the decline in voting to a decline in civic engagement – especially “cooperative” forms of behavior, like serving on committees or attending political rallies.\n\nPresciently, Putnam wrote, “This disjunctive pattern of decline – cooperation falling more rapidly than self-expression – may well have encouraged the single-issue blare and declining civility in contemporary political discourse.” When “Bowling Alone” was published in the year 2000, the major platforms that propelled social media into the mainstream had not yet launched.\n\nClearly, the Mamdani campaign understood: Political success often comes from giving people a reason to gather – true, it seems, across generations.\n\nAt the National Conflict Resolution Center, we talk about curiosity as a salve that can heal all sorts of divides – especially when it stretches us beyond preconceived ideas. I saw this in action at a recent NCRC staff retreat, where we conducted an exercise called “Generation Exploration.”\n\nEach person joined one of four groups based on age. As we discussed the events that influenced us, it was easy to see how they shaped our work styles and preferences. For example, Generation X (ages 44-59) was the first cohort to grow up in a society where two working parents became the economic and social norm; these independent “latchkey kids” can find it difficult to collaborate.\n\nAnd while all of us were affected by the pandemic, Gen Z experienced the most profound disruption. Their struggles with social isolation and disconnection occurred at a critical time for developing identity and relationships. It made the transition into the workforce – and in-person interactions – a challenge.\n\nBut Gen Z craves (rather than loathes) the opportunity to be shoulder-to-shoulder with other people. A shared purpose, like electing Zohran Mamdani, spurs action. This generation is anything but lazy, as the stereotype would have you believe.\n\nI learned that by being curious.\n\nIt’s like Thanksgiving dinner. You should try Aunt Linda’s cranberry relish, even if you think you won’t like it. You may be surprised.\n\nSteven P.

        "text": "Zohran Mamdani has the chance to reshape New York City streets in his first 100 days, sending a resounding message: “streets are for people.” As he basks in the triumph of his recent electoral victory, there are several straightforward actions he can take to effect positive change and lay the groundwork for a promising future.\n\nThe enthusiasm from advocates for safer streets, alongside bus riders, cyclists, and pedestrians, is palpable and should be harnessed before the inevitable resistance to change emerges. Mamdani’s bold transportation platform, which includes initiatives like fast and free bus services, expanded outdoor dining, and achieving Vision Zero for traffic fatalities, can be initiated with minimal costs.\n\nOn his first day, Mamdani can make a symbolic yet powerful move by transforming City Hall Park back into a space for the public, rather than a parking area. Closing the vehicular entrance at Murray Street would send a clear message: “Parks are for people, not cars.”\n\nIn the following days, up to day 100, Mamdani has the potential to implement significant street operational changes without needing the governor’s approval, thanks to a somewhat obscure traffic law. The mayor of New York City possesses significant authority to regulate streets and highways within the city’s five boroughs. This is made possible by Section 1642 of the New York Vehicle and Traffic Law, which allows cities with populations exceeding one million to establish their own traffic regulations.\n\nOne of the recommendations for Mamdani is to revert traffic parking enforcement responsibilities to the Traffic Bureau within the Department of Transportation (DOT), a practice that was in place before Rudy Giuliani’s tenure. Police officers should focus on tackling crime, not on managing transportation and engineering tasks.\n\nReturn traffic parking enforcement to the Traffic Bureau within the Department of Transportation (DOT), as it was prior to Rudy Giuliani’s administration. The police are crime fighters, not transportation planners and engineers.\n\nIt was former cop, Ben Ward, the city’s first Black traffic commissioner and then first police commissioner of color, who wanted the police out of parking enforcement, towing, intersection control and other functions that have a high risk of public confrontations. I was a sidekick of Ward’s when he was traffic commissioner and then, when I became traffic commissioner, he backed me fully as police commissioner.\n\nI had more than 2,000 uniformed traffic agents, as part of the traffic department, patrolling every part of the city. I recommend the new mayor recreate the position of traffic or streets commissioner (a “streets czar”) within the DOT, and appoint someone with a steel backbone with the following responsibilities:\n\nThe czar would “own” the streets. Everything that happens on the street, from illegal parking (especially placards) to construction blockages to street events would fall under their jurisdiction.\nThe issuance of parking placards would be under the control of a triumvirate, including the czar, a police representative, and mayor’s office. This was done in the 1980s. See more on placards.\nShow “no mercy” to cars with placards that blatantly break parking rules. Restore “write first, adjudicate later” as the standard operating procedures when encountering a “placard” car in violation. If the parking of that vehicle was legitimate, it would be dismissed by an administrative judge.\nThe function of enforcement should not be to write the most tickets to achieve revenue goals; instead, safety and mobility should be primary. Police react to complaints by writing more summonses. I found the best traffic agents were the ones who kept the curb lane clear of illegal parkers. Restore key performance indicators (KPIs) such as percent clear time where a perfect score means no illegally parked cars.\nRecreate the Traffic Intelligence Division that keeps track, and has shared veto power with the mayor’s office, of every event that blocks traffic including parades, demonstrations, construction, movie shoots, road races, etc.\n\nWe have suffered from indecision on capital projects for way too long. Within 100 days Mamdani should:\n\nMake a decision on the BQE triple-cantilever. Mayors de Blasio and Adams have futzed around for years, held numerous community meetings and workshops and have gotten nowhere. Meanwhile the structure, in poor shape already when de Blasio took over, is a dozen years older with concrete well past its intended life. Former Deputy Mayor Meera Joshi, under Adams, proposed a minimalist two-lane in each direction stacked structure that should be advanced tout de suite. \n\nIn concert with the BQE construction, allow commercial vehicles on the Belt Parkway. Robert Moses built the Belt Parkway for cars, but trucks have to use city streets — that’s bass ackwards! Mamdani should introduce a bill, while still an assemblyman, allowing commercial vehicles (small ones at first due to low overpasses). The precedent is the Grand Central Parkway where trucks are now allowed from the Triborough Bridge to the BQE. \n\nStart the process of “capping” the Cross Bronx Expressway. The state has thrown a wrench in the works saying each cap would cost $2 billion or maybe $10-20 billion in total. Nonsense! Rockefeller University, working from a wavering barge on the East River, was able to deck the FDR for about four blocks with a beautiful garden for just $500 million, and improve the adjacent Esplanade for another $8 million. Los Angeles is in the process of decking over a portion of Highway 101 for just $92 million. Pick one segment now and launch the design process. \n\nAdopt an ethos about the future often attributed to the Iroquois Nation, that “in every deliberation, we must consider the impact on the seventh generation.” When you turn on the water, ride the subway, cross a bridge, bask in the foliage of Central and Prospect Park you are the 7th or 8th or more generation to do so. The Second Ave. subway was conceived in 1929. Mamdani should be planning for mid-century and beyond. Bloomberg’s PlaNYC was a great start. Let’s get creative.\n\nDream Big. The last bridge built to Manhattan’s central business district was the Manhattan Bridge completed in 1909. World cities from Paris to London to Singapore and a score of others have built dozens, if not hundreds, of bike-pedestrian bridges in recent years.\n\nLet’s span the East River from Brooklyn Bridge Park to Governors Island to Lower Manhattan and from Long Island City to Roosevelt Island to Midtown. One can rent a Citi Bike in Jersey City and Battery Park City, but you can’t get between them by bike. A bridge from one tall building to another could solve that problem. \n\nDon’t leave Staten Island out. About $40 billion has been spent, or is going to be spent, on Manhattan transit extensions and station improvements, including: the Second Ave. subway extension, the No. 7 line extension, bringing the LIRR into Grand Central Terminal, the Fulton Street subway station, and others.\n\nI support all these projects, but they won’t do as much as to get people out of their cars than a subway to Staten Island. On April 14, 1923 the city broke ground on the subway from Bay Ridge to Richmond (I have the invitation, which I’ve written about previously on these pages). If we resurrect this project, then maybe we can have a subway extension by mid-century. \n\nFocus on the way New Yorker’s move today. Technology in the form of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is not going to solve our traffic problems. In fact, it may make things worse. AV shuttles at airports and robo-taxis for last mile to/from transit in low density areas of the city may make sense within the next 5-10 years.\n\nBut, in the densest parts of our boroughs the best technology was invented 1600 B.C. — shoes! We are a walking city, and every step (pun intended) Mamdani takes should be for seven generations hence to walk our town. \n\nKey to success will be the appointment of an action-oriented creative DOT commissioner who has the experience, stature, and intestinal fortitude to face the NIMBYs, cynics, and perpetual bellyachers. As for days 101-200… stay tuned!\n\nSchwartz is a former NYC traffic commissioner.",

Calling folks BIPOC should never have been a thing. Defund the police was a terrible idea. Point shows that nearly 70 percent of Americans think the Democratic Party is out of touch and it's more interested in social issues than economic ones. We can no longer be a party with a whiff of moral absolutism.”\n\n“I don't know that any one of those issues really would have mattered that much,” said Miller, pointing out that accusations of New York Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani being too “woke” fell flat because voters knew Mamdani was instead completely focused on the economic issues facing Americans.\n\nMiller admitted critics will shout “Harris did de-emphasize that stuff,” that she “didn't talk about any of that stuff lefty, cultural stuff at the convention.”\n\n“And that's true. She did. But she didn't emphasize something else,” Miller said. “She allowed herself to be defined because she didn't define herself necessarily, clearly enough for enough voters, around a specific topic or issue that they care about. And in the upcoming elections, that issue for almost every Democrat is going to have to be addressing the economic woes.”\n\nCatch the Bulwark podcast at this link.",

Hegseth obeyed. And now they’re mad about Kelly and the Democrats calling them out on it.\n\nBut impunity is only half the story. The other half is contempt.\n\nOr it should be.\n\nThat’s why I was pleased to see Kelly’s appearance on Rachel Maddow’s MSNOW show this week. At the end, she asked how he was doing — if the stress of the president’s threats were getting to him and his family.\n\nKelly is a decorated combat pilot. He flew close to 40 missions during the first Gulf War. He was an astronaut. His wife survived an attempted assassination. To my ears, his reply was contemptuous — not of Maddow’s question, but of the idea that Trump can intimidate him.\n\n“I’ve had a missile blowup next to my airplane. I’ve been nearly shot down multiple times. I’ve flown a rocket ship into space four times … My wife, Gabby Gifford, meeting her constituents, shot in the head, six people killed around her. A horrific thing. She spent six months in the hospital. We know what political violence is and we know what causes it, too. The statements that Donald Trump has made are inciteful. He’s got millions of supporters. People listen to what he says more than anybody else in the country. He should be careful with his words.\n\n“But I’m not gonna be silenced here. Is it stressful? I’ve been stressed by things more important than Donald Trump trying to intimidate me in shutting my mouth and not doing my job. He didn’t like what I said. I’m gonna show up for work every day, support the Constitution, do my job, hold this administration accountable – hold this president accountable when he is out of line. That’s the responsibility of every US senator and every member of Congress. He’s not gonna silence us.”\n\nThe written word can do a lot but it can’t carry the emotion in the sentences above. Listen for yourself. What I hear is contempt.\n\nThat’s what this country needs to hear. That’s what this country needs to hear from men like United States Senator Mark Kelly. America needs more contempt for impunity for the law, morality and decency, and for one more thing — untouchable elites, like Trump, who never grew up.\n\nLast week, when Trump met New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, he met a man who, like Kelly, could not be intimidated. The reaction from the president, according to Bruce Fanger, was “that strange little-boy energy, the hero-worship vibe, like he’s suddenly standing in line for an autograph from someone who embodies a version of power he’ll never actually possess: calm, earned, rooted.”\n\nYou could say Trump’s behavior with Mamdani was obsequious, Fanger said, but there’s more to it. There’s “that schoolboy glow — ‘Notice me. Approve of me. Let me stand near your seriousness so I look serious too.’ It’s the emotional posture of someone who’s been trying to cosplay adulthood for 50 years and gets starstruck by the real thing.” (My italics).\n\nTrump has lived a long life believing he’s the exception to every rule – that he will never face the consequences of his choices, not even the seemingly heinous, like association with known child-sex trafficker.\n\nOnly the little people are accountable, not this One Special Boy.\n\nThat deserves contempt, or at least righteous anger, which is what D. Earl Stephens heard in Kelly’s voice when I asked him. In any case, Earl said, it’s amazing that everyone isn’t feeling one of those emotions.\n\nEarl is the former managing editor of Stars and Stripes, a newspaper covering the military and military affairs. He now publishes the newsletter Enough Already. Like me, he’s a regular contributor to Raw Story. \n\n“Either we are a law-abiding country or we aren't,” he told me.\n\nHere’s my short interview with Earl.\n\nJS: Rachel Maddow asked Mark Kelly if he was stressed by the president's attempts to intimidate him. Kelly's answer dripped with contempt. Is that the spirit we need to see from the Democrats?\n\nDS: I didn't hear contempt. I heard righteous anger, and I just don't know how everybody isn't angry at this point right now.\n\nPete Hegseth talks endlessly about \"warriors.\" Yet by his words and deeds, he's a fool. This is evident to the personnel inside of the military, isn't it? Or are there too many people willing to play along?\n\nSorry to say, there are far too many people willing to play along. Hegseth speaks to far too many young, immature white men, who are angry and aren't even sure why. They are led by their emotions, which is why we lean on them to do most of our fighting.\n\nRuben Gallego put it in terms of manliness. What's your view?\n\nThis is 100 percent correct, and goes to my earlier point of immaturity.\n\nAm I right to say Kelly is going to get more famous thanks to Trump that Trump will look at him the way he looked at Zohran Mamdani?\n\nYou are. The more people get to know Kelly, the more they will be impressed by him. “Patriot” is a word that is tossed around too much, but Kelly fits the definition.\n\nIs accountability the direction the Democrats need to go on? Whether it's the cabinet or ICE thugs?\n\nI just don't see another direction. Either we are a law-abiding country or we aren't. This all should have been nipped in the bud with urgency following the attack on January 6. For whatever reason, Joe Biden and/or Merrick Garland dawdled, and allowed Trump a second wind.\n\nWe damn well better learn from that.",

        "text": "In a new political ad in Georgia’s Senate race, GOP Rep. Mike Collins‘ campaign released a video featuring incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff saying he knows his vote to shut down the government will hurt farmers: “But I wouldn’t know. I’ve only seen a farm on Instagram.” Ossoff never said any of this. When challenged on spreading disinformation using Ossoff’s likeness and voice, Collins’ campaign doubled down, saying they were pleased the ad sparked conversation — proving they were either oblivious to the dangerous precedent or had simply decided to embrace it as strategy.\n\nWhile political cartoonists have long created derogatory or lampoonish images of elected officials and candidates for public office, the political imagery that can be created by artificial intelligence blurs truth and fiction in unprecedented ways. AI can make falsehoods look authentic and, when used by politicians themselves, it becomes particularly harmful. AI use that started as experimentation by campaigns has evolved into something far more troubling: It now merges satire, disinformation and official messaging that misleads voters and distorts democratic discourse.\n\nIn New York City’s recent mayoral race, former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo‘s campaign released an ad on social media, which was later deleted, featuring purported “criminals for Zohran Mamdani” — a parade of racist caricatures that included a pimp in a purple suit, along with a drunk driver, shoplifter and domestic abuser endorsing the Democratic nominee. In one sequence, a Black man shoplifts from a bodega, his face visibly morphing mid-clip as he puts on a keffiyeh and mask before robbing the store. As AI tools grow more sophisticated, Mamdani’s election may serve as both a warning and a testament: A warning of how easily political imagery can be weaponized, and a testament to the electorate’s enduring capacity to look beyond manipulation.\n\nIn recent weeks we have seen the official X account of the National Republican Senatorial Committee post a video of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also talking about the government shutdown. “Every day gets better for us,” the AI-generated video says. While the quote is accurate, the image of Schumer maniacally grinning as he says it is completely fabricated. \n\nTaking such creative license with elected officials’ images confuses the electorate about what is real. And, even if the Cuomo campaign claimed their ad represented their genuine beliefs about Mamdani supporters, portraying AI-generated individuals as real people destroys voters’ ability to distinguish fact from propaganda. It feeds the worst instincts in our politics — rewarding deception over debate, spectacle over substance. \n\nIn these cases, political operatives are generating disinformation and misleading the public at a time when confidence in the government to protect the common good is low and shaken by the recent government shutdown. When AI-generated videos portray something that never happened with such realism, it stops being satire and is instead a false representation. Voters encountering these images have no way to know they’re fabricated — and that’s precisely the point.\n\nThe dangers of weaponized media manipulation are not theoretical. In Rwanda, hate radio broadcasts during the lead-up to the 1994 genocide systematically dehumanized Tutsis as “cockroaches” and spreading false claims about planned attacks on Hutus. These broadcasts didn’t just report hatred. They manufactured it, creating a shared false reality that made mass violence seem not only justified but necessary. Through relentless repetition, the medium’s authority normalized the dehumanization until neighbors turned on neighbors. \n\nToday’s AI-generated political content operates with a similar psychological architecture. Imagine if those orchestrating the genocide has possessed today’s tools to fake videos of Tutsis’ attacking, chatbots fabricating eyewitness accounts and AI manipulating footage of political leaders suggesting retaliation. When politicians deploy these tools to portray opponents as criminals, threats or caricatures, they’re not just lying. They’re constructing an alternate visual record designed to shape and control collective perception. The Rwandan radio didn’t cause the genocide on its own, but it prepared the national mind for it. \n\nThe minds of the public are now being desensitized to ridicule, and to racist images. Another video of Schumer, this time with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., had racist overtones, showing Jeffries wearing a sombrero accompanied by mariachi music. Critically, it appeared on President Donald Trump’s official X account. The video recalls the yellow journalism of William Randolph Hearst’s New York Journal — only now, what once took hours to print and eventually reached thousands can be created in seconds and seen by millions.\n\nWhen elected officials themselves engage in such behavior, it further erodes moral character as a basis for evaluating our government officials, normalizes such racism and ridicule as a part of the American political process, and redefines cruelty as content — none of which serves the American people well. While satire was intended to serve as a moral check on power, now politicians themselves are using it as a tool of power, wielding both viral velocity and institutional authority.\n\nBut perhaps most insidiously, AI-generated political content blurs the line between opinion and fact. What begins as a politician’s viewpoint — Jeffries is soft on immigration, Schumer celebrates chaos — gets packaged into seemingly authentic visual “evidence.” As content like this is amplified and reshared across social media, it transforms from obvious manipulation into what resembles verified “fact.” This is truth-impersonating propaganda: personal opinions weaponized through AI to look like objective reality, posted from public official accounts that lend them institutional credibility. \n\nIn the aftermath of the nationwide “No Kings” protests on Oct. 18, Trump posted another AI-generated video showing him as a fighter pilot dumping what appears to be feces on American protestors. Beyond the obvious cruelty of a president mocking citizens exercising their constitutional rights, the video underscores his inherent disrespect for the people he represents, as an elected official’s primary concern should be advancing the American people’s interests and informing them. When he models using AI for such frivolous, mocking, hurtful purposes, Trump is also turning a deaf ear to such concerns.\n\nWant more sharp takes on politics? Sign up for our free newsletter, Standing Room Only, written by Amanda Marcotte, now also a weekly show on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nSuch irresponsible applications of AI reinforce the need for regulatory safeguards, though the current political climate suggests this is highly unlikely to happen at the federal level. States have the ability to mandate limitations on inappropriate AI use, though we may be fast approaching the volume of AI-generated ads that would make enforcement challenging. In fact, a disclaimer on a lie does not undo the lie; it merely documents that deception occurred, and every day that passes without comprehensive federal action pushes us closer to a political landscape where truth becomes fundamentally unverifiable.\n\nMore than ever, we need leaders with strong moral character, personal discipline and the ability to model prudential choices about when and how to use such a powerful technology. Given that AI uses a tremendous amount of energy and water, public servants should be applying it towards solving society’s most intractable problems, not creating racist tropes or belittling people for exercising their democratic rights. \n\nThe voting public has the power to make AI ethics a defining issue that shapes norms of behavior around technology. Judicious use of AI should become a defining attribute of successful candidates in future elections. One of us co-authored “Voting for Ethics: A Guide for U.S. Voters, Second Edition,” which outlines what voters can look for in candidates using AI responsibly. Candidates using AI ethically will have transparent policies outlining their use of AI and campaign ethics codes. Notably, Ossoff responded ethically to Collins’ campaign video falsely depicting him and announced that he would not be using AI-generated deepfakes — drawing a line that more candidates must follow.\n\nIn the United States, California has set the pace, enacting a series of laws in 2024 that make transparency and integrity in AI use not just ethical ideals, but a legal requirement. The European Union’s AI Act — widely regarded as the most comprehensive framework — requires all AI-generated content, including deepfakes, to be clearly labeled with watermarks or metadata. Major platforms like Facebook and TikTok must identify and flag manipulated audio and imagery with penalties reaching up to 35 million euros for non-compliance. Already, deepfake election incidents have struck at least 38 countries. In Romania, the 2024 presidential election was annulled in part due to AI-powered interference through coordinated disinformation campaigns and manipulated online content.\n\nTech leaders need to own their role in the degradation of democracy and prepare for justifiable backlash and reputational damage from economic boycotts. Inaction translates to a legitimate business risk with potential legal liability as AI-generated political content continues to erode public discourse and confidence in government officials. When allegiance to power trumps commitment to principles, tech leaders shouldn’t be surprised when both users and history hold them accountable. \n\nThe irresponsible use of AI by people in government leadership positions suggests that we are at a moment that transcends politics. What is society’s moral code? If politicians, news outlets, and civic organizations adopted a “civic covenant for the AI age,” much like current journalistic standards, could we create a healthier public square?\n\nLike other civic duties, such as voting, verifying information before sharing can become a new norm for responsible citizenship. Ultimately, it is the vote that gives us the power to communicate to political figures how we expect them to steward this powerful technology and use it for the common good. Technology amplifies whatever moral climate it enters, and right now, that climate is being shaped from the highest office to local leaders who seemingly treat deception as strategy. The ultimate question is not whether we can restore truth to politics, it’s whether we will act before the damage becomes irreversible.",

        "text": "Even the least informed among Republicans should have gained valuable insights from the Schumer Shutdown. Impeding so many functions of government for 40+ days served a purpose for Democrats. It didn't matter how many Americans were suffering or what kinds of delays and hardships citizens were encountering. That some people wouldn't be able to pay their bills or eat full meals was of little concern.\n\nHolding Out on Cue\n\nThose crafty Democrats, ever plotting and planning for ways to take political control and to wield absolute power, had sought all along to hold out until the November 4, 2025, elections.\n\nWith the rock-solid support of the fakestream propaganda machine, they knew they’d be able to usher in a distinct, if limited, number of new governors, attorneys general, mayors, and other elected officials across the country. Obviously, the few elections were small in number compared to the forthcoming midterms and to the 2028 national election.\n\nIt behooves everyone on the Right, nonetheless, to understand that Democrat leadership is not weak-willed or moronic. They are unrelenting in their fervor. In each and every instance where they can muster any leverage, no matter how many of their own constituents it hurts, they seek to take political power. They aim to dominate in election after election, and ultimately, to bring down the country. Legions of them are a part of the movement.\n\nPart of Plan\n\nAs we've witnessed, they grow more brazen with the passage of time. Their quest to destroy America was once a closely guarded secret. Now, the quiet part is often said out loud. Behaviors that seem shocking to the Right are merely aspects of the Left’s overall plan.\n\nFor too long, the Right has pretended or been fooled into thinking that the outliers among Democratic leaders did not represent the base. We believed that people who spoke and acted in a radical manner, which would have made Democrats of yesteryear shudder, were somehow anomalies. They are not.\n\nWhen you hear AOC and her childish blather, Jasmine Crockett and her constant idiotic harangue, Hakeem Jeffries and his idle threats, and now Zohran Mamdani and Katie Wilson, it's vital to understand that these zealots are on a mission and will not be dissuaded from it.\n\nThat Was Then, This is Now\n\nA few decades ago, one could argue that Republicans and Democrats had reasonably similar goals for the strength and vitality of our nation, but differed in approaches. Today, that is simply not the case. Many, if not most, on the Left, including many moderates, unknowingly brainwashed from birth, have concluded that American culture is not worthy of being maintained. They believe that we are inherently evil, the U.S. Constitution must be scrapped, and everything must be restarted from scratch under Democrat rule, ultimately yielding to one-world rule. \n\nTheir preferences for implementing no-cash bail, defunding the police, squeezing the middle class, weakening the military, over-printing money, and so much more all have one essential objective: to weaken us on every dimension.\n\nThe full measure of the Left’s sinister intent is not widely comprehended by the American populace and, of course, is never accurately portrayed by the fakestream media. Then, once arriving at a certain level of equilibrium, they will charge forward. As a prime example, with Mamdani being elected in New York, the next day, his tenor changes, his statements become bolder, and his true intent emerges.\n\nIn the Oval Office, he makes nice with President Trump for one day, all for show. Soon enough, voters will come to realize they were duped by him. All around us, the same scenario plays out repeatedly, primarily on the East and Left (West) coast.\n\nPowerful Propaganda\n\nAs disastrous as their programs, policies, and results prove to be, because the fakestream media is totally committed to Leftist causes, every story is spun accordingly. Whether it is inflation, immigration, blue city crime, etc., Democrat viewpoints will be bankrolled and propped up for years, even as the fakestream media dies a slow death.\n\nDespite the acceleration of alternative news sources that strive for some measure of objectivity, the fakestream media could hang on well past Donald Trump's second term. Even with Republican presidents for 12 years, Democrats still will be in a prime position to spread their poison. The hoaxes will not dissipate. The bogus stories will continue on. Voter fraud and election tampering might still not be resolved despite President Trump’s sterling efforts.\n\nLeftists have successfully hoodwinked tens of millions of voters, voters who have been thoroughly programmed to pledge their allegiance to false authorities. Their numbers and efficacy cannot be denied. The danger that the Founding Fathers feared most – the enemy from within – is here.\n\nA Decades-Long Battle\n\nWe will attain victories sporadically. Like \"whack-a-mole,\" as soon as we deal with one Leftist promulgated hoax or crisis, another and another and another will arise. We are facing a decades-long battle. Like Moses, we will not be around to experience the promise land.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Townhall’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

        "text": "As the festive season approaches, many Americans are feeling increasingly disenchanted with the current occupant of the White House. They perceive him as prioritizing relationships with billionaires over addressing the inflationary pressures that are squeezing household finances.\n\nPresident Donald Trump frequently touts securing trillions in fresh investments from thriving tech companies, yet this achievement seems disconnected from the reality most Americans face: escalating grocery bills. His focus on deal-making appears misaligned with their immediate concerns.\n\nAccording to a recent online survey conducted by Daily Mail and J.L./Partners, which included approximately 1,250 registered U.S. voters, inflation and the rising cost of living top the list of grievances against Trump’s administration.\n\nThese issues, along with healthcare, pose significant challenges as Trump’s second term progresses into its second year, potentially undermining his tenure.\n\nSarah Selip, founder of 917 Strategies and a former GOP House aide, remarked to the Daily Mail that “affordability will be the buzzword of the 2026 election cycle.”\n\nConversely, respondents showed the least concern for issues such as cryptocurrency, small business regulations, artificial intelligence, and energy policy, despite these being areas where the president has heavily invested his time and resources.\n\nThe reticence over the lack of cash comes as the interests of blue-collar and white-collar workers have largely been replaced with those of tuxedo-wearing titans who get invited to White House soirees.\n\nSince September, the president has had at least four executive actions related to AI; he has also attended at least three tuxedo-laden dinner parties with executives like Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and Apple’s Tim Cook and world leaders such as Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Salman and the UK’s King Charles.\n\nBut voters don’t care about AI, crypto, small business regulations or infrastructure, the Daily Mail/JL Partners survey found. Those initiatives rank as the four lowest priorities among survey respondents.\n\n‘Voters are frustrated,’ Brittany Martinez, executive director of the right-leaning political firm Principles First, told the Daily Mail. ‘While the administration touts billion-dollar announcements and high-profile corporate deals, most Americans are focused on far more basic needs: whether they can afford groceries, gas, and a good life.’\n\nHowever, the White House was quick to blame the previous Democratic administration for consumer pricing woes.\n\n‘After four years of economic calamity under Biden, American families will continue to feel economic relief in the months ahead as the positive effects of massive tax cuts, deregulation, and energy dominance continue to materialize,’ White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told the Daily Mail. \n\nThe Daily Mail/J.L. Partners survey also found several other critical signals that may spell concern for Republicans with a year until the midterms.\n\nTrump matched his worst disapproval rating so far, 55 percent, as Vice President JD Vance and the rest of the Cabinet all saw declines in favorability.\n\n‘Through a combination of the shutdown, and one year on from the election, voters seem to have turned around and asked: ‘am I better off than I was a year ago?’. The answer for many – going by this poll – is no, or even that things have got worse,’ J..L. Partners founder James Johnson told the Daily Mail. \n\nMeanwhile, the approval rating for the Democratic Party and its top 2028 champions, like California Governor Gavin Newsom, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and former VP Kamala Harris, has ticked up.\n\nAll three of the aforementioned liberals would, at least at this moment, beat Vance or Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a hypothetical 2028 head-to-head matchup, the poll data showed.\n\n‘When families feel squeezed and Washington seems disconnected from their day-to-day reality, they naturally start exploring alternatives,’ Martinez said. ‘The growing openness to progressive candidates in this poll is beyond ideology — it’s about urgency.’\n\nIf the GOP takes its eyes off the proverbial affordability ball, it could strike out during the midterms. Democrats only need to flip three seats in the House and four in the Senate to take control of Congress. \n\n‘American families across the political spectrum are experiencing a growing sense of economic hopelessness,’ Republican strategist Tristan Shakespeare told the Daily Mail.\n\n‘When the average household can no longer afford groceries, housing, healthcare, and other basic essentials without falling further behind, it’s inevitable that people start searching for alternatives. Many feel abandoned by a system that claims to prioritize the broad public but consistently fails to deliver.’\n\nAnd that, he says, is leading to a rise in dissident political figures on the left and right.\n\n‘This disillusionment is fueling demands for systemic change—manifesting as calls for National Socialism from figures like Nick Fuentes on the right and Democratic Socialism from leaders like Zohran Mamdani on the left.’\n\nThe president’s 2024 campaign focused heavily on driving down prices that ticked up under former President Joe Biden, but so far, consumers have yet to register the savings. The poll found that Democrats are more trusted on cost-of-living policies than Republicans.\n\n‘He made massive, huge promises that everything was going to get better and that everything was Joe Biden’s everything was Joe Biden’s fault, that over the course of the last year, people have watched him spend more time on vanity projects and enriching himself than actually delivering for the American people,’ said Democratic strategist Mike Nellis. \n\nWhile the White House adds a new massive ballroom to host larger parties for its tuxedo-wearing allies, at a cost estimated to be around $300 million, voters remain frustrated with everyday prices.\n\nThe White House did not return the Daily Mail’s request for comment.",

        "text": "Multiple people were arrested Saturday after protesters in Lower Manhattan’s Chinatown physically blocked federal agents from leaving a parking garage during what appeared to be a planned immigration enforcement operation, according to the New York Police Department (NYPD) and local reports. \n\nOfficers observed multiple individuals blocking the street and exits at different locations, and the individuals were also observed throwing debris, according to the NYPD’s Deputy Commissioner of Public Information (DCPI) in an email response to Newsweek. \n\n“Following social media posts calling agitators to ICE’s location in New York City, individuals dressed in black clothing with backpacks, face masks, and goggles showed up and began to obstruct federal law enforcement officers including by blocking the parking garage,” a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson told Newsweek on Saturday.\n\nAuthorities told Newsweek protesters were instructed multiple times to disperse and did not comply, resulting in multiple individuals being taken into custody.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nPresident Donald Trump‘s administration has already gone after other Democrat-run cities, citing high crime and homicide rates as the justification for bringing in Immigration and Customs (ICE) agents and, at times, the National Guard as necessary to clamp down on crime and enforce immigration law.\n\nThe focus on immigrant neighborhoods, churches, and businesses has raised concerns about civil rights and the scope of federal enforcement beyond designated border zones, especially as local and state leaders voiced opposition to the operation.\n\nThe protest also occurred as New York leaders have been preparing for an escalation in ICE activity after the mayoral election of Zohran Mamdani, a Democrat and democratic socialist who has vowed to fight back against Trump’s immigration crackdown. \n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK – NOVEMBER 29: A person is detained by NYPD as immigration activists block ICE vans during a protest against a purported ICE raid on Canal Street on November 29, 2025 in New York City.

Demonstrators formed a human barricade at the garage entrance and piled garbage bags to prevent vehicles from exiting, effectively foiling the apparent raid. The protesters were seen blocking vehicles and shouting “ICE out of New York,” according to video obtained by ABC News.\n\nBy the early afternoon, nearly 200 people had gathered on the street outside, chanting and yelling at the agents, who peered out from inside the garage. Just after 1:15 p.m., the confrontation erupted into chaos when agents burst from the garage in their vehicles and protesters chased them down Canal Street, hurling planters and trash cans after them, according to local reports and witnesses on the scene. At one point, a protester ran in front of one of the moving vehicles and a masked agent sprayed something at protesters from the open windows.\n\nThe parking garage, which was part of a government building, is just blocks away from the scene of a large-scale immigration raid in Lower Manhattan last month, the New York Times reported. During that raid, more than 50 federal agents swept through the area near Canal Street, arresting nine people, mostly men from West Africa, on a stretch of sidewalk long known as a marketplace for counterfeit goods.\n\n At least nine people were arrested during that raid, according to federal officials who spoke to ABC News. Four U.S. citizens were arrested and held for nearly 24 hours without any federal charges following that incident, according to U.S. Rep. Dan Goldman, who represents the area.\n\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK – NOVEMBER 29: A person is detained by NYPD as immigration activists block a garage used by ICE vans during a protest against a purported ICE raid on Canal Street on November 29, 2025 in New York City.

        "text": "A proposed law that would dictate nonprofit organizations have the first opportunity to buy residential buildings in New York City is being blasted as “Stalinesque legislation” that would push the Big Apple into a “communist dystopia.”\n\nCritics are saying New York City Council’s “far left majority” is trying to control how private property is sold — and is including a penalty of $30,000 if building owners resist, according to a report by the New York Post on Saturday.\n\nCalled the Community Opportunity for Purchase Act (COPA), the bill dictates that sellers let “community land trusts” and other not-for-profit organizations make first offers on buildings with at least three units when they hit the real estate market and then match any private-sector offers, the Post reported.\n\nThough the bill has languished since it was sponsored by Brooklyn Councilwoman Sandy Nurse back in the Spring of 2024, it has suddenly gained support in recent months after Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani first won the Democratic primary and then was elected mayor on November 4.\n\nAs of Friday, according to the Post, 32 of 51 council members are sponsoring the bill, more than enough to pass it.\n\n“COPA is yet another attack on private real-estate ownership in this city,” Council Minority Leader Joann Ariola, a Queens Republican, told the New York tabloid.\n\nShe continued, “We’re sliding headfirst into a communist dystopia where the government and their apparatchik developers own all the property, and the rest of us get forced into perpetual rentorship, and this legislation is helping to get us there even quicker.”\n\nCouncilwoman Nurse, however, told the Post she has “high hopes” the bill passes before the end of the year, saying “COPA is another tool to grow affordable housing and keep families here.”\n\nOthers say the law would create yet more delays for property owners already dealing with the city’s bureaucracy.\n\nAccording to the Post:\n\nResidential building owners would be required to notify the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development and a yet-to-be-determined list of “qualified” nonprofits before offering the properties up for sale on the open market.\nNonprofits interested would have 60 days to notify the owner and HPD of their intent to purchase and other 120 days to make a “competitive” offer. If a nonprofit doesn’t show interest, or the offer is rejected, the owner can sell the building on the open market.\n\nThose who don’t comply could face civil fines of up to $30,000.\n\nAnn Korchak, board president of the Small Property Owners of New York, told the Post that the bill would cause a “slow and painful demise” for small building owners while rewarding politically connected non-profits.\n\n“It is government-engineered interference in free-market transactions that eliminates negotiations, private sales, and potential buyers in favor of approved non-profits,” she said.\n\nThe New York State Association of Realtors, which represents more than 61,000 real estate agents, also blasted the bill in a statement, calling it “an unwarranted government intrusion into private real estate transactions” that would cause delays and “negatively impact” both buyers and sellers.\n\nThe association added, “The opportunity to purchase a building at list price would lead property owners to lose income when multiple offers are likely to be placed on a building.”\n\nContributor Lowell Cauffiel is the best-selling author of Below the Line and nine other crime novels and nonfiction titles.

An Uber spokesperson told the NYT that the company is now showing this disclosure to New Yorkers, although they described the law as “poorly drafted and ambiguous” and insisted that Uber only uses geography and customer demand to calculate its dynamic pricing.\n\nThe National Retail Federation filed a lawsuit to stop the law, but a federal judge allowed it to move forward.\n\nLina Khan, former chair of the Federal Trade Commission and now co-chair of the mayoral transition team for Zohran Mamdani, told the NYT that the law will be an “absolutely vital” tool for the government, but she also suggested there’s a “ton more work to be done” to regulate the practice.",

        "text": "Katie Wilson, the newly elected mayor of Seattle, has pledged to shield the city from the influence of former President Donald Trump, signaling a transformative shift for Washington’s largest metropolis.\n\nIn a closely contested race, Wilson, aged 43, emerged victorious on Election Night earlier this month by securing 50.2 percent of the vote. She narrowly surpassed incumbent Mayor Bruce Harrell by a margin of 2,004 votes, as reported by the King County Board of Elections.\n\nEchoing New York City’s embrace of Zohran Mamdani, Seattle, a bastion of West Coast liberalism, is venturing into new territory by opting for a socialist mayor.\n\nWilson’s agenda for the city of 781,000 includes making it resilient against the policies of Trump, focusing on affordable housing, enhancing public safety, and addressing the needs of the city’s significant homeless population, which numbers around 16,000.\n\nShe has assured her supporters that she will implement a progressive socialist agenda, which includes introducing new taxes on the wealthy and establishing public grocery stores—initiatives also advocated by Mamdani, 34. The political trajectories of the two new mayors often draw comparisons.\n\nIn response, former President Donald Trump, 79, has labeled Wilson as a “very liberal-slash-communist mayor,” suggesting her policies extend well beyond traditional liberalism.\n\nHe also diminished her to ‘another beauty’ and has threatened to take away the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which has a scheduled six matches in the Emerald City this summer. \n\n‘If we think there’s gonna be another problem, we’re gonna move this event to another place where it’s going to be appreciated and safe,’ Trump said.\n\nNow, Wilson is prepared to stand before President Trump, if he’ll have her, to defend her city. \n\n‘I’ll meet with anyone,’ she told The Seattle Times. ‘I mean, he’s the president of the United States… There are going to be some people who probably see taking those meetings as selling out. \n\n‘But I think that a lot of people on the progressive left do have a sophisticated understanding of what it’s going to take to deliver on a bold progressive agenda, and that it’s not just about only talking to your friends and using the mayor’s office as a soapbox.’\n\nTrump has not extended an offer to Wilson at this time. The Daily Mail has reached out to Wilson for comment. \n\nHere are all the ways Wilson’s policies are set to change Seattle. \n\nTrump-proof Seattle \n\nWilson has been on a campaign to ‘Trump-proof’ Seattle since 2017, when Transit Riders Union – an organization she cofounded – proposed to start an income tax on wealthy households. \n\nWashington State does not have an income tax. It is one of the nine that do not.\n\n‘That was inspired by Trump’s first election,’ she wrote on her campaign website. \n\n‘Here we are eight years later, again having to think about how to protect ourselves and our neighbors from the actions of an even more virulent federal administration.’ \n\n‘We know what’s coming, because it’s already happening,’ she continued. \n\n‘Cuts to safety net programs, cuts to federal grants that support local services and infrastructure projects, tax cuts for the rich, attacks on the most vulnerable members of our communities.’\n\nShe has vowed to defend the LGBT+ community, reproductive rights, immigrants and refugees, and fight against mass deportation. \n\nWilson also said Seattle will continue SNAP benefits, Medicaid, and other federal programs that are in peril. \n\nWhat are critics saying? \n\nWilson is walking into a deficit in the budget of $127 million, according to The Urbanist. With federal grant cuts, she faces an even bigger budget problem, which could make it harder to complete her agenda. \n\nAffordable and abundant housing\n\nAffordable housing is a massive problem across the US. Seattle’s monthly average rents for a one-bedroom apartment are $1,795, a two-bedroom is $2,640, according to Zillow estimates. \n\nThe average home sells for nearly $841,000 in the city, which is up by hundreds of thousands compared to the national average. \n\n‘The cost to rent or buy a home in Seattle is far too high. Too many families are paying well over a third of their income in housing costs, or leaving the city altogether,’ Wilson said on her campaign website. \n\nWilson moved to the city with her husband in her early 20s and said it was easy to find an affordable place to live and to build a life in the coastal city. However, she admits, that isn’t the same for those moving there now and she still needs her parents’ money to afford to live there. \n\n‘Today, it would be nearly impossible for another young couple to follow in our footsteps,’ the mother-of-one said. \n\nWilson’s father David, 76, exclusively told the Daily Mail he and his ex-professor wife spent about $5,000 to help their daughter – but hopes she’ll no longer need the cash when she starts earning a $250,000 City Hall salary.\n\nWilson, who shares a two-year-old daughter with her unemployed husband, had admitted her parents helped pay for childcare costs that amounted to about $2,200 a month.\n\nAfter revealing that he sent his daughter ‘four or five checks,’ David pushed back on discussing the details of his parental largesse. ‘Oh please, don’t get that specific,’ he exclaimed. ‘I mean, what’s the point?’\n\nWilson has vowed to build publicly-owned, permanent affordable housing, as Seattle residents have voted for twice. \n\nWilson also promises to pursue a $1 billion bond, like King County has, to create thousands of units and homes faster. \n\nShe has also proposed using empty units as places to shelter homeless people. \n\nWhat are critics saying? \n\nCritics wonder if putting up homeless people in vacant apartments and building homes to get people off the street will cause a housing shortage in the already-expensive city. \n\nEach unit could cost the city $20,000 a year, and there isn’t enough funding to keep the proposal going, especially when federal fund runs out next year. \n\nThe proposal could cost the city and taxpayers between $72 million and $165 million annually, The Times estimated. \n\nHomelessness\n\nSeattle has anywhere between 16,000 and 22,000 homeless people living on the streets, and the city’s shelter system is overloaded. \n\nWilson promised to open 4,000 new units of emergency housing within the next four years. \n\nShe is also looking to revert the drug-infested city back to a paradise by investing in opioid treatment programs, mobile treatment services, counseling, and housing. \n\nHer biggest plan is to create a local deep housing subsidy to help keep people in their federally-funded homes after the government grant expires next year. \n\nWilson also wants to help keep low-income residents in their homes and will work to keep eviction notices off their doors to avoid a ‘revolving door back into homelessness.’ \n\nWhat are critics saying? \n\nIncumbent Harrell called her plan ‘short-sighted’ and say it will ‘decimate new affordable housing production.’ \n\n‘Katie Wilson claims to care about affordability, yet her signature plan would gut funding for the most effective tool we have to increase affordability: more housing,’ his campaign said. \n\nHe called it a ‘blueprint for disaster’ and said it would ‘deprive low-income and working people of new affordable housing.’ \n\nPublic safety \n\nCrime rates in Seattle are significantly higher than the national average. According to a study by Security.org based on 2024 FBI data, it is the fourth worst city in the country.\n\nTotal crime rate per 100,000 people was 5,782.7 last year, that’s 172.9 percent higher than the national average of 2,119 incidents.\n\nBut crime rates have been falling this year. The total number of offenses recorded are 36,224 as off November 26. For the whole of 2024, 45,884 were reported.\n\nTo tackle crime, Wilson wants to bolster existing programs such as the Fire Department’s Health 99 program, which connects people who have overdosed with services after being stabilized. \n\nShe also wants to ‘dramatically improve the city’s record on violence prevention and response’ by getting guns off the street, making it harder to get lethal weapons, including limiting bulk purchases of firearms, and by getting better lighting to protect pedestrians. \n\nThe socialist also wants to expand ‘alternative crisis response’ and increase civilian roles so ‘police can focus on policing.’ \n\nWhat are critics saying? \n\nHarrell argued during the campaign that his opponent, like Mamdani, had previously advocated for defunding the police. \n\nShe has since walked back on that and said: ‘We can’t just scale down the size of the police department based on the calls we think can be taken by alternative responders,’ despite advocating for more ‘alternative crisis response’ programs.",

        "text": "Consumers spent record amounts online over the holiday period, marking the biggest digital spend on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday despite broader economic concerns ahead of the weekend. \n\nConsultancy firm Deloitte ahead of Thanksgiving found that consumers intended to rein in spending amid inflation and affordability issues, with expectations of the first drop in year-over-year spending since tracking began in 2020.\n\nHowever, Adobe Analytics, which tracks e-commerce, found that consumers hit a record spend on both Thanksgiving and Black Friday – though it remains to be seen if overall spending throughout the weekend follows the same trend or not. \n\nWhy It Matters\n\nAffordability and cost of living remain the chief reasons many voted for President Donald Trump in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, and after almost a year back in office, those concerns remain high for many voters and ultimately proved crucial in New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s shock win over Andrew Cuomo in both the Democratic primary and the November mayoral election. \n\nTrump has tried to address the issue in a number of ways, and recently appeared to dismiss concerns about cost of living as a “con” by Democrats, telling reporters earlier this month, “I don’t want to hear about the affordability,” claiming his government brought down inflation to a “very low number.” \n\nPeople visit Garden State Plaza during Black Friday shopping on November 28, 2025 in Paramus, New Jersey. (Photo by Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images)\n\nWhat To Know\n\nAdobe Analytics on Saturday announced that U.S. consumers on Thanksgiving spent a record $6.4 billion and on Black Friday spent a record $11.8 billion – the latter of which is a 9.1 percent increase over the previous year. \n\nAdobe also expects shoppers to spend another $5.5 billion on Saturday and $5.9 billion on Sunday before hitting an estimated $14 billion on Cyber Monday, which would set another record. \n\nVideo game consoles, electronics, and home appliances saw increases in sales on both days, and social media advertising, as well as shopping services powered by artificial intelligence, helped influence spending choices, according to the firm. \n\nSoftware company Salesforce added to the rosy estimates by saying that Black Friday digital sales totaled $18 billion in the U.S. and globally hit around $79 billion, while e-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants recorded $6.2 billion in sales worldwide. \n\nSome analysts raised the prospect that these record numbers could be inflated by higher-than-usual prices due to Trump’s tariffs on foreign imports, with Salesforce noting that despite the higher overall spend the number of items at checkout on Black Friday dropped two percent compared to last year and order volumes declining one percent overall compared to the same period. \n\nMichelle Meyer, chief economics at the global research and advisory Mastercard Economics Institute, said that rather than outright withholding spending due to economic uncertainty, shoppers chose to take advantage of discounts and sales, ultimately choosing to shop early, leverage promotions, and invest in wish-list items. \n\nThe overall economic picture remains unknown, with initial data from real-time foot traffic tracker RetailNext finding a 3.6 percent drop in visits to physical stores on Black Friday compared to 2024 – although that is less than the drop noted in the days leading up to Thanksgiving, which saw a 6.2 percent decline.\n\n What People Are Saying\n\nChip West, retail and consumer behavior expert at RR Donnelley, told The New York Times: “Despite questions about its relevance due to the prolonged, monthlong promotional season, Black Friday remains the most significant shopping day of the holiday season.” \n\nGrant Gustafson, head of retail consulting and analytics at Sensormatic Solutions, told The Associated Press: “Black Friday has really turned into like a full week event, or even further,” adding, “Black Friday is really the start of just a really critical stretch for retailers.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nThe full picture of economic health won’t be clear until full sales numbers for the weekend and Cyber Monday are known, showing the total five-day spend on in-person and online shopping. \n\nThis article includes reporting by The Associated Press.",

        "text": "Marjorie Taylor Greene’s unexpected resignation from Congress last week sent shockwaves through Washington, leaving both sides of the political aisle scrambling to understand her departure at such a pivotal moment in her career.\n\nInsiders familiar with the tensions between Greene and both her fellow Republicans and former President Donald Trump revealed to the Daily Mail that she had ultimately pushed Trump beyond his limits.\n\nFor several months, Greene had aligned herself with Representative Thomas Massie in the contentious battle over the release of Epstein-related files. Although this stance frustrated Trump, sources close to him told the Daily Mail that their relationship might have endured the strain.\n\nWhat ultimately severed ties between Greene and Trump was her persistent implication that he was ‘abandoning’ or ‘betraying’ the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement.\n\n“The president was the architect of the MAGA movement,” a Trump confidant explained to the Daily Mail. “It’s unrealistic to challenge Trump on this front without expecting significant repercussions.”\n\nGiven Trump’s notorious propensity to retaliate fiercely against critics, some observers noted that it was unsurprising he would respond to Greene’s comments with considerable force.\n\n‘She was poking the bear for quite a while,’ a MAGA political consultant told the Daily Mail.\n\nGreene was among the first political figures inspired by Trump to run for office, but she grew increasingly despondent about their inability to change Washington, DC.\n\nOne Republican source told the Daily Mail it was increasingly a hallmark of the MAGA era Congressional Republicans who stormed Washington, DC.\n\n‘I think they burn out really quick,’ the source noted. ‘They have so much ambition, so much hope, all of these ideas that go viral on X and then they get to congress and they can’t get s**t done.’\n\nSources revealed that everyone in Washington was familiar with Green’s latest political image reboot, by vocally criticizing the Republican party, House Speaker Mike Johnson and even Trump himself.\n\n‘She’s gone through this before,’ a source close to Greene told the Daily Mail, noting that in recent months Greene had replaced some of her more experienced aides with ‘some of the dumbest men I’ve met in her life’ who spent their time applauding her and encouraging her worst instincts.\n\nFor weeks, Greene has been basking in the widespread wave of support and media attention she received since she started criticizing Trump.\n\nHer newfound willingness to buck the Republican party predictably earned her invitations to appear on CNN, Bill Maher’s HBO show and even with the Trump-hating co-hosts of ‘The View.’\n\n‘I’m really tired of the pissing contest in Washington between the men,’ Greene told The View co-hosts.\n\n‘You’re taking my job,’ co-host Joy Behar cooed.\n\nShocked co-host Sonny Hostin admitted she didn’t even recognize Greene, who she thought was the crazy Q-Anon member of Congress who had once tried the connect the dots on ‘Jewish space lasers.’\n\nGreene insisted she had been misled by social media and that people were fooled by clips of her that were taken out of context by the media.\n\nMaher reacted similarly.\n\n‘I feel like I’m sitting next to a completely different Marjorie Taylor Greene, why the evolution?’ he asked.\n\nGreene pivoted to remind the audience she was born and raised in a working-class family, and was the owner of a construction company, blaming ‘both sides’ in Washington, DC, for their failure to address problems.\n\n‘I have no problem pointing fingers at everyone,’ she said, earning applause from the hosts and the audience.\n\nThat was the behavior of a 2028 presidential candidate, Republican consultants noted, who were watching her movements closely.\n\n‘I think she’s happy about it. She’s getting a ton of attention which she cares about and at the same time she’s definitely bored of Congress,’ one source close to Trump told the Daily Mail.\n\nWhen reminded by Republicans that politics was a ‘team sport,’ Greene responded she was ‘not willing to wear the Republican jersey’ anymore, comparing herself to a ‘battered wife’ that did not need to take any more abuse.\n\nWhen Trump told reporters that Greene had ‘lost her way’ she replied: ‘I haven’t lost my way. I’m 100% America first and only!’\n\nMany of her supporters have shortened to the acronym ‘AFAO’ which indicates a separation from Trump’s MAGA movement.\n\nIn the wake of her resignation, Greene furiously denied she was interested in a 2028 presidential campaign.\n\nBut she also did not rule out the idea, Republicans noted.\n\nMAGA figures who have spoken with Greene since her retirement announcement lamented that her separation from Trump was ‘unfortunate’ but that they are not aware of any future plans.\n\nThere is a growing group of MAGA supporters who feel the president has lost his way, with his attention focused on peace deals, meetings with foreign leaders, and willingness to align with his former critics.\n\nGreene supporters watched in horror as Trump was overwhelmingly gracious to the newly elected avowed Democratic socialist for mayor Zohran Mamdani – and at the same time was pillorying Greene as a traitor.\n\nIn the future, Greene may find a presidential run impossible to resist, as it offers more political and media attention, and the opportunity to hold potential candidates like Vice President JD Vance accountable, should he choose to run in 2028.\n\nWhen the drama over Trump dies down and Greene approaches her departure date from Washington, DC her supporters may rally toward her return to elected politics.\n\nAfter a dramatic 24 hours since Greene insisted she was not running for president, she admitted she had received overwhelming support over the weekend and returned to her new political slogan.\n\n‘America First America Only!’ she repeated Tuesday morning.",

People around him see this as the moment he believes his cancellation is over – he's now basically un-cancelled, and Mimi will help his comeback.\" \n\nAnother claimed: \"Mimi has kept her private life completely locked down since Philip died, so this surprises everyone. But they looked comfortable and happy – and that says a lot.\" \n\nO'Donnell, who shared three children with Hoffman, Cooper, 22, Tallulah, 18, and Willa, 16, has maintained a low public profile outside her political involvement in New York. \n\nShe previously appeared in an ad for mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, supporting progressive ideas like \"free child care, free buses.\"C.K., born Louis Alfred Székely, was previously married to Alix Bailey from 1995 to 2008 and has two children. \n\nThe comic's downfall began in November 2017, when he was faced with sexual harassment allegations from five women, several of whom said he masturbated in front of them without consent. \n\nHe released a statement acknowledging the accounts were accurate. Despite fierce debate over his return, C.K. slowly resumed touring in 2019. \n\nO'Donnell's past with Hoffman remains central to her public identity. \n\nThe actor, known for Capote and The Master, died after relapsing into drug use following more than two decades of sobriety, with friends saying the couple had separated in the months before his death due to his escalating heroin dependency. \n\nThe movie star was found lifeless with 70 bags of heroin and 20 used needles in his West Village apartment.Now O'Donnell's new relationship has left those close to her both stunned and cautiously optimistic. \n\nOne source claimed: \"Mimi guarded her heart for years. The fact she's opening it again – and with Louis – is the strongest sign yet that she's ready for a new chapter, even if it is a surprising one.\" \n\nThey concluded: \"It's a resurrection of sorts for them both – for Louis as he re-emerges into mainstream life again, and a new love for her after the tragedy of Philip's sad death.\"",

        "text": "Violence in stores on Black Friday used to be a result of Americans’ excessive passion for beating each other to good deals on merchandise. Nowadays, as the Islamist infiltration of America continues full steam, the violence is a result of enthusiasm for Muslim terrorism.\n\nHamas co-founder’s son Mosab Hassan Yousef issued a warning this week to Americans that through educational initiatives, funding for propaganda, public agitation, political campaigns, and more, radical Muslims are trying to transform America into the same terrorist cesspool that Gaza is. And his warning is coming true right before our eyes, between the CIA-tied Afghan who shot National Guardsmen this week and the anti-Israel Black Friday rioters.\n\n“They fund the genocide, free Palestine!” bellowed the pro-Hamas protestors in NYC’s Zara, which they accused of being a “genocidal company.” Under the cutesy slogans such as “while you’re shopping, bombs are dropping” is the pernicious lie that Israel is the aggressor, and the jihad-loving Palestinians the victims. Despite UNICEF data showing Gazans have higher obesity rates than Israel, despite the almost constant flow of aid into Gaza, despite the repeated ceasefire violations from Palestinians, the lie is still fueling antisemitism worldwide.\n\nWATCH: The New York City Police Department confirmed multiple arrests after pro-Palestinian agitators entered a ZARA store in Manhattan on Black Friday, holding signs, blowing whistles and waving a Palestinian flag. pic.twitter.com/Gd5gG4uZ0Y— Fox News (@FoxNews) November 29, 2025\n\nRelated: Pirro: First Degree Murder Charges Against Guardsman’s Killer\n\nIronically, the old white women with the posters and Palestinian flag would be raped and/or treated as second-class citizens if they were in Gaza.\n\nThe UK Daily Mail reported:\n\nThe New York Police Department confirmed to Daily Mail that a 29-year-old man was arrested for trespassing, and three individuals were issued criminal summonses.Protesters continued demonstrations into the early evening, marching down Fifth Avenue with signs, drums, and flags. \n\nAnd, of course, soon Zohran Mamdani, the pro-terror, antisemitic, socialist radical, will be running New York City. God help us all.\n\nRelated: Israel Roasts Hamas, Exposes a Century of Arab Rejection of Peace\n\nAs I noted above, the pro-Hamas agitation is particularly sobering in the context of a warning from a man who saw how a territory is transformed by terrorists from the inside. “They don’t need tanks. They need ballots. Look at Zohran Mamdani,” Yousef, who defected from the terrorist movement his father founded to Israel, wrote. He continued:\n\nLook at your campuses. “Students for Justice in Palestine” sounds noble, right? Same crowd, different mask. They don’t need to bomb buses here. They lobby, march, guilt-trip, invert reality: turn “Free Palestine” into “Zionists are evil,” turn Jews from fellow citizens into the enemy overnight. Sabotage a multi-trillion-dollar aerospace defense pact with Israel. Fool Americans into thinking Israel is a liability rather than the greatest American asset.Qatar wires billions to American universities and mosques, appoints imams who preach “interfaith” until the megaphone is handed to them—then it’s pure fire against Israel. Same double mask: charity fronts, hugs for the cameras, while underneath they fund hate abroad and fracture you at home.\n\nDivide and conquer — that is the Islamist strategy in America as surely as it is the strategy in the Middle East.\n\nNote: It's the holiday season, which means PJ Media VIP's Black Friday sale is back!\n\nNow through Monday evening, 11:59 PM ET, receive 60% OFF an annual VIP, VIP Gold, or VIP Platinum membership with promo code FIGHT.",

        "text": "The US Congressional Progressive Caucus on Friday accused President Donald Trump of “flagrantly interfering” in Honduras’ upcoming presidential election after Trump announced his endorsement of right-wing candidate Nasry “Tito” Asfura and repeated threats he’s made previously ahead of other electoral contests in which he sought to secure a conservative win.\n\nOn the social media platform X, Trump warned that only a victory for former Tegucigalpa Mayor Asfura and the National Party in Sunday’s election will allow Honduras and the US to “fight the Narcocommunists, and bring needed aid to the people” of the Central American country.\n\nHe accused Asfura’s opponents — former finance and defense minister Rixi Moncada of the left-wing Liberty and Refoundation (Libre) Party, which is now in power, and sportscaster Salvador Nasralla of the centrist Liberal Party — of being communists and said Nasralla is running as a spoiler in order to split the vote and weaken Asfura. He added that a loss for the right-wing candidate would allow Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro “and his Narcoterrorists [to] take over another country like they have taken over Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.”\n\nThe president also wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, that “if [Asfura] doesn’t win, the US will not be throwing good money after bad,” repeating a comment he made during New York City’s mayoral election in which he urged voters to reject progressive candidate Zohran Mamdani or risk losing federal aid for the city. Trump also offered Argentina a $40 billion bailout if voters elected his ally, Javier Milei, earlier this year.\n\nUnder President Xiomara Castro, the Libre Party’s government has invested in hospitals and education, and has made strides in halting the privatization of the country’s electricity system, Drop Site News reported. The poverty rate has also been reduced by about 13% since Castro took office in 2021, although, as the outlet reported, some rights advocates have criticized Castro’s government for keeping “many of her predecessor’s militarized policies in place, despite her commitment to implement a more community-minded strategy.”\n\nTrump added in his social media post that he was issuing a pardon to former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who represented the National Party and is currently serving a 45-year prison sentence in the US after being convicted of working with drug traffickers who paid bribes to ensure more than 400 tons of cocaine were sent to the US. The pardon was announced as Trump continues his threats against Venezuela, which he has accused of trafficking drugs to the US.\n\nCPC Deputy Chair Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Whip Jesús “Chuy” García (D-Ill.) called Trump’s “smearing” of Asfura’s opponents “completely unacceptable,” and noted that the president has been joined by other congressional Republicans in making “wild, unsubstantiated allegations” regarding Honduras’ election — including Rep. María Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.), who voiced “support for a military coup.”\n\nSalazar said recently that “16 years ago, the military saved its country from communism and today, they need to do the same thing,” referring to the US-backed overthrow of democratically-elected President Manuel Zelaya.\n\n“These Cold War-era threats and blatant interventions create hostile conditions for free and fair elections and must stop immediately,” said Omar and García. “We also cannot tolerate premature declarations by prominent US politicians regarding the election results before ballots are fully counted. Attempts to delegitimize the vote based on who wins could be disastrous in light of the harmful history of US interference in modern Honduran politics.”\n\nThe two progressive leaders were echoing concerns brought up by Honduran Vice Foreign Minister Gerardo Torres, who spoke at a gathering of left-wing leaders on Thursday in Tegucigalpa.\n\nTorres warned that the Electoral Council could claim Nasry is winning “with an irreversible trend” before the actual winner of the wide-open race is clear on Sunday.\n\n“Even Trump could congratulate him — and that’s when real trouble will erupt in this country,” said Torres.\n\nThe chaos that could result could lead election officials to “nullify the elections and hold new ones in six months, leaving Libre weakened and allowing the right to win,” reported El País. Torres posited that this is the National Party’s “strategy.”\n\n“The right wing cannot win on Sunday; that needs to be clear and repeated ad nauseam,” Torres said, urging advocates to promote Moncada’s candidacy on social media and help mobilize voters to get to the polls early.\n\nOmar and García noted that after Honduras’ 2017 election, the Trump administration endorsed Hernández’s reelection “despite evidence of fraud and the killing by his security forces of Hondurans who protested the results.”\n\nMore than 20 people were killed in the aftermath of the disputed 2017 election\n\nThe two progressive leaders said that “Sunday’s elections are taking place at a critical moment, as the country aims to elect and transfer political power to a new leader for the first time outside of the context of the repressive post-coup regimes that persisted from 2009 to 2021.”\n\n“At a time of global democratic fragility, we must move beyond US bullying and political interference in Honduras’s sovereign affairs. We need a relationship based on mutual respect, including respect for the will of Honduran voters,” said Omar and García.\n\nTorres expressed hope that Trump’s backing of Asfura will have the opposite effect that the US president intended, saying Trump’s comments on social media were “a blow to the right; it hurts one of their candidates.”\n\n“If there was anyone who didn’t know there were elections in Honduras this Sunday, now everyone knows,” said Torres. “There are even people who went to look at a map to see where Honduras is and find out who Rixi Moncada is… It puts us in an important position, which creates a wonderful scenario, because Rixi’s victory will be more famous and important. We have no doubt about her victory.”\n\nTorres added that many conservative voters in Honduras are likely to reject the party formerly led by Hernández.\n\n“These are right-wing people who opposed the narcostate, who stood with us in 2015 against [Hernández’s] embezzlement of social security, and who know what those criminals are,” he said, referring to previous governments. “Trump can tweet all day and those people aren’t going to vote for the return of the conservatives.”\n\nJosé Mario López of the Jesuit Reflection, Research, and Communication Team in Honduras also told Drop Site News that the “red scare” tactics that the National and Liberal parties have joined Trump in using in the final weeks of the election are likely to have some sway with older people, but are “not expected to impact younger voters.”\n\n“It’s a discourse that doesn’t really land, in my view,” López told the outlet. “I think what can move votes is the economic issue, because historically one of the main problems identified in public opinion polls is unemployment and lack of economic opportunities.”",

        "text": "undefinedRead MoreundefinedSettingsundefinedFull Screen (F)undefinedPlay (SPACE)\n\nFor the 72-year-old author, two key signs show how Trump is weakening. First, Wolff pointed to Trump’s political ping-ponging as a sign that his mental capacity is declining, as Trump underwent whiplash-inducing 180s on both his allies and enemies in November. \n\n“Wherever he is mentally, I think we’ve seen some evident weirdness,” said Wolff. \n\n“The fact that he can go, and it would seem in the course of a day, from being a Putin booster to a Zelensky booster. That he can go from, ‘Mamdani, we’re gonna deport the guy,’ to ‘we’re gonna embrace the guy.’ I think that he’s traveling very quickly between the extremes of these issues as though, A, he doesn’t know what he stands for anymore, or B, he forgets,” he said.\n\nOn Nov. 21, Trump had an unexpectedly chummy meeting with New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani that left Republicans scrambling on how to spin the president’s budding bromance with the 34-year-old Democratic socialist they’d been trying to smear as the villainous, radical new face of the Democratic Party.\n\nTrump has also signaled support for both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war—though he’s leaned more toward Putin’s side throughout his presidency. \n\nWolff also noted that Trump’s erratic and unpopular behavior has caused even his most loyal followers in Congress to get sick of him, citing Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s shock resignation last week.\n\n“You sense her incredible weariness of having to deal with Donald Trump,“ said Wolff. ”She’s gone from the greatest loyalist to open rebellion. And I think that we are seeing this more and more throughout the Republican Party.\"\n\nGreene’s resignation led to speculation that more Republicans would follow her lead. Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy warned Greene was the “canary in the coal mine” for a crisis among the GOP’s House caucus. \n\n“Other people in that Trump orbit of necessary loyalty and fealty experience the same thing,” said Wolff. “That it is incredibly unrewarding, that all that it gets you is grief because you’re a kind of pinball. You never know what Donald Trump wants. You never know what he’s going to ask you to do. You never know what breach you’re going to have to step into. You never know how foolish you’re going to look.”\n\nTo Wolff, no person in Trump’s orbit has suffered that unrewarding battering like House Speaker Mike Johnson. Wolff and Coles discussed Johnson’s appearance on the podcast of Katie Miller, the wife of Homeland Security adviser Stephen Miller. They observed that Johnson’s beleaguered testimony of his time as speaker under Trump showed the wear and tear of doing Trump’s bidding. \n\n“[Trump is] a 79-year-old man who doesn’t take care of himself,” said Wolff. “Mike Johnson might be experiencing all kinds of pressures of the job and the whiplash of dealing with Donald Trump.”\n\n“[Trump] emerges from this year as an incredibly dominant character in this moment in time and in this job,” he added. “But the dominance, and I think this is what we’re seeing, has had an enormous price. It’s had a price on him physically because it really has demanded living in the middle of this drama every day. And then it’s exacted a price on so many people around him, like Mike Johnson.” \n\nThe White House refused to respond to Wolff’s comments. Instead, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung said, “Michael Wolff is a lying sack of s--t and has been proven to be a fraud. He routinely fabricates stories originating from his sick and warped imagination, only possible because he has a severe and debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his peanut-sized brain.”",

Smith blasted newly-elected socialist Mayor Zohran Mamdani for his lofty claims that everything will be “free” in New York City when he takes office.\n\nAppearing on the Joe and Jada podcast, Smith explained why he thinks Mamdani is going to become a major problem for New York City once he is given the oath of office on January 1 of 2026.\n\n“Free ain’t reality,” Smith said referring to Mamdani’s penchant of saying he intends to offer a long list of “free” services to city residents.\n\n“Free buses, free grocery stores. You’re seeing free child care. It ain’t free. Nothing’s free in this world. And nobody should know that better than minorities in this country. Whether it’s black of Hispanics,” Smith said after saying Mamdani is a “problem.”\n\n“No one should ever fail to know that. What he means is the redistribution of wealth,” Smith said.\n\nThe ESPN talker then went on to say that if Mamdani “messes” with either small or big businesses owners to shake them down to fund his “free” agenda, they will stop operating in New York and move elsewhere.\n\nSmith also flat-out said that Mamdani is communist, not progressive. “He’s talked about seizing properties,” he said. “That’s communism. That’s Marxism.”\n\nHe also said that the Republicans will use everything against Mamdani in particular and the Democrats in general for being opposed to the American way of life.\n\n“I moved out of New York last year. I got a spot in Florida,” Smith admitted. “I’m out, I’M out! My home is in Florida. I’m out.”\n\nSmith did note that he agrees with Mamdani that we all need to worry about the needy, but he worries that the new mayor’s ideas simply won’t work.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: Facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston, Truth Social @WarnerToddHuston, or at X/Twitter @WTHuston",

        "text": "A friend who works with high school students recently said to me, “I overheard a group of boys talking about 'international Jewry.'” He was in disbelief to hear these seemingly mild-mannered kids express views that, not 20 years ago, would have been considered taboo.\n\nWhat is going on with Gen Z?\n\nI have written elsewhere that Gen Z is experiencing a kind of church resurgence. That remains true. But at the same time, Gen Z is one of the most polarized generations in American history.\n\nSocial systems that seek to reorient reality by means of uprooting history and tradition will ultimately create a rootless and disaffected class in search of belonging.\n\nIn 2024, Gen Z — led in part by young activists like Charlie Kirk and Scott Presler — shifted toward Donald Trump. He won 46% of Gen Z voters — 56% of young men and 40% of young women. This led many to expect that a younger, more populist generation would shift the country rightward. But now in 2025, the self-proclaimed Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani won 78% of the youth vote in New York City — 67% of young men and 84% of young women. Far from being locked into any one existing political party, young people are more divided than ever.\n\nOne cause of this is what I call “nomadic progressivism.” Kids born between, say, 1997 and 2012 have been thoroughly inundated with progressivism and identity politics from birth. They came of age amid several key developments that shaped their moral and social formation:\n\nThe Supreme Court’s Obergefell v. Hodges decision in 2015 and the legalization of same-sex marriage.The killing of Trayvon Martin and the rise of Black Lives Matter.The surge of transgender activism that dominated headlines in the early 2020s.The appearance of Greta Thunberg and the new climate movement.The explosive growth of Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, and Vine.\n\nWe could list hundreds of others, but these movements captured Gen Z’s moral imagination. Each sought, in the name of justice or progress, to undermine the inherited order, replacing the inherited structures of culture with moral and social uncertainty.\n\nGen Z grew up bullied by progressive ideology, and until the shocking election of Donald Trump in 2016, there was no visible reaction. Society appeared to be marching unopposed toward progressive utopia. But Trump’s election broke the spell. His first term was marked by protests, the rise of transgender ideology, and a wave of social revolt.\n\nThen came COVID-19. As the left preached “safety,” Gen Z was locked inside, immersed in a digital environment, and wracked by depression and anxiety. Created for engagement and real community, young people were instead sent to their rooms and told to stay there.\n\nThis, I believe, is the key: Progressivism prepared the soil for radicalization. It removed the roots — churches, families, communities — that once grounded Gen Z’s moral life. It left young people searching for belonging in a barren landscape.\n\nThe philosopher and novelist Simone Weil wrote in “The Need for Roots” that “human beings have roots by virtue of their real, active, and natural participation in the life of a community, which preserves in living shape particular treasures of the past and particular expectations for the future.” When that participation is stripped away, people search for roots elsewhere.\n\nFor Gen Z women, that search often led to Instagram and other social media platforms. They heard celebrities and influencers denounce the status quo. They were told marriage was oppressive, men were vile, and independence was the highest good. But that “empowerment” was often just loneliness in disguise.\n\nRELATED: Young, broke, and voting blue: 2025’s harsh lesson for the right\n\n Photo by Jeremy Weine/Getty Images\n\nAs for Gen Z men, constant ridicule and belittlement left them disoriented. Why invest in a society that despises you? Why build what the world condemns? In this vacuum arose the “manosphere.” Figures like Andrew Tate offered refuge. They told men it was OK to be men — and as they were among the only ones saying so, they had free rein to define what it meant. If honor, discipline, and respectful courtship were only going to get you mocked and condemned, manosphere influencers reasoned that you might as well double down on boorishness, lust, and aggression.\n\nAs distrust of the government and institutions grew, young men turned elsewhere for truth. In gnostic fashion, figures like Nick Fuentes promised to reveal “how things really are.” But as Christopher Rufo has noted, it is a ruse. Fuentes exploits the crisis of masculinity to peddle resentment and historical denialism. Progressive Gen Z women, seeking fulfillment in the depths of the online space, are little different from the young men seeking connection and meaning from those like Fuentes.\n\nGen Z is a generation longing for roots. Its members are trying to find them on the fringes of society, since their own roots were dug out years ago. Progressivism creates nomads. Social systems that seek to reorient reality by means of uprooting history and tradition will ultimately create a rootless and disaffected class in search of belonging. And they will find it in dark places.\n\nThe men and women of Gen Z are not uniquely radical. They are uniquely rootless. They have inherited a moral landscape stripped of shared meaning, through which they drift amid ideologies that promise belonging but deliver only bitterness. The progressive order unmoored them; now the reactionary order recruits them. And unless a deeper renewal of faith, family, and community takes root, this generation will continue to wander — searching for the very home that modernity taught them to forget.\n\nEditor’s note: A version of this article appeared originally at the American Mind.",

        "text": "Small-property owners are suing New York, city and state, in federal court, aiming to get tens of thousands of their “zombie” apartments back on the market.\n\nPray they win; tenants desperately need that housing — and local politicians need a warning about how their excess are endangering all the rent laws.\n\nThe problem: 2019 changes to the Rent Stabilization Law under then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo made even vacant apartments subject to rent regulation if their buildings were built before 1974 (which covers about a million units).\n\nThose “reforms” also severely restricted how much of the costs for repairs and upgrades the landlord can pass along to new tenants as rent.\n\nAll that made it near-impossible for owners to recoup the money they’d have to spend to bring units up to code after a longtime tenant vacates; far better to just keep them off the market.\n\nTake brothers Pashko and Tony Lulgjuraj, landlords in Washington Heights.\n\nTwo units in their five-story building would take thousands to fix up, but the law bars them from charging enough rent to cover that.\n\nFor example, rent in one two-bedroom unit, a would be capped at just $710 a month, not nearly enough to offset costs.\n\nThe result: Landlords like the Lulgjurajs have to warehouse units rather than lose money by fixing and renting them.\n\nThe Census Bureau counts 26,000 such “zombie” apartments as of last year — vacant even as would-be tenants would practically kill to get them; others put the count as high as 50,000.\n\nEither way, the number would balloon under Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s plans to freeze rents.\n\nWith help from the Institute for Justice public-interest law firm (which has taken 13 cases all the way to the US Supreme Court, winning 11 of them), the plaintiffs argue that these laws add up to an unconstitutional “taking” of property.\n\nIt’s hard to argue with that: By making it prohibitively expensive to rent their units, the law renders the apartments near-worthless.\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court refused to hear a broader challenge to the rent laws: Those plaintiffs argued that, in requiring owners to renew nearly all leases and barring them from reclaiming more than one rent-stabilized apartment for their own, it, too, imposed an unconstitutional “taking” on landlords.\n\nBut even as the high court declined to confront the issue, Justice Clarence Thomas stressed that the “constitutionality of regimes like New York City’s” is a “pressing question,” arguing the Supremes should take up the issue “in an appropriate future case.”\n\nThis might be it: Since the apartments in the new suit are vacant, no tenants would lose out if the law were fixed; indeed, apartment-hunters would benefit, since more units would be available.\n\nWatch out, New York politicians: If this obvious, everybody-loses injustice prompts the Supremes to eventually take up this case, they might feel logically compelled to completely toss the rent laws — especially if Mamdani imposes his freeze by the time they get the case.\n\nWe’ve long urged Albany to at least tweak the law so zombie apartments can be rented: The added risk of attracting the Supreme Court’s unwelcome attention should now make that fix a top priority for the Legislature.\n\nDon’t say we didn’t warn you!",

        "text": "“Affordability” has become the word of the month as American economic anxieties become a major point of political contention between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nSocialist Democrat Zohran Mamdani rode to victory in the New York City mayor’s race in part due to his promise to address the issue. Of course, he offered what socialists have been selling to the public for more than a century: free stuff, all paid for by the “rich,” the “billionaires,” or in Mamdani’s case, white neighborhoods in the city.\n\nBut talk is one thing, reality is another. Will the kind of government intervention Mamdani and others are promising deliver positive results for the American people?\n\nSo far, it hasn’t. President Donald Trump and those who seek to stem this socialist tide have a serious rebuttal to the idea that the Left can deliver.\n\nAt the highest level, it’s Trump’s work on foreign policy, on trade, and the implementation of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” that may determine how much the U.S. economy revs up next year. Many Americans are nevertheless discontented with the way things are going. And that is a huge red flag for Trump and Republicans.\n\nA lot depends on what happens to the economy on the macro, national scale, but it’s still awfully rich to hear Democrats suddenly embrace affordability as an issue given their abysmal record on it.\n\nIn fact, the huge gap between red states and blue states on affordability highlights the reality of the parties’ policies.\n\nEven some figures on the Left acknowledge that Democrats have a huge problem on the issue.\n\nCNN’s Fareed Zakaria noted this problem for the Left on a recent episode of his show while commenting on the government shutdown that accomplished about as much as Sen. Cory Booker’s record-breaking phony “filibuster.”\n\nHe said the shutdown revealed that Democrats have promised big on so many programs, like Obamacare, but the results have been costly and ineffective.\n\n“If America has an affordability crisis, it tends to be in places Democrats govern, like New York, Illinois, and California, which all feature high taxes, soaring housing costs, and stagnant outcomes in basic areas like education and infrastructure,” he said.\n\nZakaria pointed to New York City, where the incoming mayor-elect has promised a whole host of “free” programs at the public expense. The CNN anchor asked rhetorically, “What happened to the money already raised?”\n\nIn 2012, he said, “the city’s budget was about $65 billion. Today it is about $116 billion, an increase of more than 75% in just over a decade. Spending has soared while the subway deteriorates. Housing costs rise and public schools remain mediocre despite spending more than $36,000 per pupil last year, the highest in the nation among major school districts.”\n\nFor all the talk of an “abundance” agenda that’s going nowhere, the reality is that Democrat-run cities and states are where abundance is squandered and “affordability” is a slogan to sooth the conscience of the rich as the middle class shrinks and seeks greener pastures.\n\nA study at UC Berkeley released in April noted that the significant gap in affordability between red and blue states has been consistent over the last 15 years. According to the study, “the average blue state was 13% more expensive, overall, than the average red state.”\n\nThe study pointed to the cost of housing being the biggest factor, but it’s clear that on a whole host of issues Democrat policies drive up prices.\n\nThere’s typically a wide gap on energy policies, with Democrats focusing on various green and “renewable” energy sources. While these government-subsidized industries have often enriched a few, for the most part they have been both cost prohibitive and insufficient for America’s growing energy needs.\n\n“Over the past two decades, the divergence in electricity rates among U.S. states has grown increasingly stark,” noted a paper on electricity costs published by The Heritage Foundation in 2024.\n\nThe cost gap was mostly between red and blue states.\n\n“A key factor driving these divergences is the adoption of renewable energy mandates, carbon emission–reduction goals, and cap-and-trade schemes, primarily in states with Democratic leadership. States that have required renewables, particularly wind and solar energy, to be used in electricity production often experience higher electricity costs due to the regulatory burdens placed on traditional energy sources, such as natural gas and coal.”\n\nEven discounting the economic data, the evidence of the divide on affordability can be seen quite clearly on how Americans have been voting with their feet.\n\nAn analysis of IRS and census data by the organization Unleash Prosperity found that a “massive shift” in internal migration has been happening in America the last few decades.\n\n“New York and California top the list of exodus states, having lost 1.7 million and 1.6 million people, respectively, over this decade,” read a Daily Signal report on this study. “Illinois, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Louisiana, Virginia, and Connecticut round out the top 10 for negative migration.”\n\nAmericans are fleeing, mostly to lower-cost states like Texas and Florida according to the study.\n\nWhat the Mamdanis of the world are promising is a doubling down on the policies that made so many blue states unaffordable for the average American. All they offer is a more aggressive platform of redistribution. But the underlying costs won’t go away. Those policies won’t make energy cheaper, they won’t drop prices at the gas pump, they won’t make homes Americans want to live in any more affordable.\n\nSo, if Trump and Republicans want to win over Americans, they need to demonstrate how they can make life more affordable for everyone, in part by doubling down on policies that already work.\n\nIf they can’t make that case then we may in fact get the socialist wave we fear in the near-term future.",

        "text": "Americans have a glum view of the economy, but that is not expected to affect their consumer spending as holiday shopping kicks off. \n\nAccording to a recent Fox News survey, 76% of Americans have a negative view of the economy. At the end of President Joe Biden’s term, this number was 70%. Yet, while Americans appear to be losing faith in the vitality of the U.S. economy, they don’t plan on slowing down their own holiday shopping habits. \n\nThe International Council of Shopping Centers reports that between Thanksgiving Day and Cyber Monday, 235 million American adults are expected to spend $127 billion, for an average of $542 a person—a $13 increase from the average spent over the long holiday weekend last year. \n\nMillennials are projected to be the biggest spenders, with the International Council of Shopping Centers estimating the generation born between 1981 and 1996 will drop an average of $764 a person during the five-day shopping period. \n\nSo, what’s the disconnect? Why do the same Americans who feel the economy is flailing appear to feel good enough about their personal bank account to go out and drop several hundred dollars in just a few days? Nicole Huyer, a senior research associate in The Heritage Foundation’s Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies, joins this week’s edition of “Problematic Women” to discuss. \n\nAlso on today’s show, we discuss spending differences between men and women. Plus, will New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani actually be able to implement his socialist wish list in the Big Apple? And if he can, what will that mean not only for New York City’s economy, but the economic health of the nation? \n\nCatch the conversation on this week’s edition of “Problematic Women.”",

        "text": "The City Council’s far-left majority is pushing the Big Apple into a “communist dystopia” with Stalinesque legislation designed to control how private property is sold — and penalizing owners $30,000 if they resist.\n\nThe “Community Opportunity for Purchase Act,” or COPA, forces sellers to let “community land trusts” and other nonprofits providing affordable housing make first offers to buy residential buildings with at least three units once they’re on the market – and then match competing private-sector offers.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by Brooklyn Councilwoman Sandy Nurse, was introduced in May 2024 and has gained steam in recent months after Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani won the June Democratic primary before cruising to victory on Nov. 4.\n\nAs of Friday, 32 of the 51 Council members had signed on as sponsors, more than the 26 votes needed to pass, and just shy of the 34 needed to override a mayoral veto.\n\n“COPA is yet another attack on private real-estate ownership in this city,” said Council Minority Leader Joann Ariola (R-Queens).\n\n“We’re sliding headfirst into a communist dystopia where the government and their apparatchik developers own all the property, and the rest of us get forced into perpetual rentorship, and this legislation is helping to get us there even quicker.”\n\nNurse told The Post she has “high hopes” the bill will get to the floor for a vote before the legislative session expires at year’s end “given the growing support” for it “with the rising cost of rent and the dream of homeownership further out of reach.”\n\n“COPA is another tool to grow affordable housing and keep families here,” she said.\n\nThe bill would install new bureaucratic hurdles for already beseiged property owners. It is modeled after similar programs already in place in other left-wing cities like Washington, D.C., and San Francisco.\n\nResidential building owners would be required to notify the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development and a yet-to-be-determined list of “qualified” nonprofits before offering the properties up for sale on the open market.\n\nNonprofits interested would have 60 days to notify the owner and HPD of their intent to purchase and other 120 days to make a “competitive” offer. If a nonprofit doesn’t show interest, or the offer is rejected, the owner can sell the building on the open market.\n\nBuilding owners violating the law would face civil fines of up to $30,000.\n\nNurse’s staff sent out an email this week to other City Council staff saying an “amended version” of the bill would soon be released and then discussed during a web briefing on Wednesday. A Nurse spokesperson declined to discuss the planned changes with The Post.\n\nAnn Korchak, board president of the Small Property Owners of New York, said the bill, as is, would cause a “slow and painful demise” for small building owners, while boosting politically connected non-profits who’d benefit from chaos and property devaluation the legislation would create.\n\n“It is government-engineered interference in free-market transactions that eliminates negotiations, private sales, and potential buyers in favor of approved non-profits,” said Korchak, whose group represents more than 5,700 landlords.\n\nThe New York State Association of Realtors, which represents more than 61,000 real estate agent, ripped the bill as “an unwarranted government intrusion into private real estate transactions that would likely establish unreasonable delays in the sale residential buildings, negatively impacting buyers, sellers, real estate professionals, and state and city coffers.”\n\n“The opportunity to purchase a building at list price would lead property owners to lose income when multiple offers are likely to be placed on a building,” it added.\n\n“This lost income would cost city government tax revenues, as New York City currently receives more than $1 billion in revenue from real property transfer taxes.\n\n“Many building owners are not wealthy, corporate entities. Small landlords would be hurt by the delay in the transaction process, which would cost them income in the form of reduced sales prices.”\n\nA City Council spokesperson said the bill is “going through the legislative process” and declined to elaborate on whether Speaker Adrienne Adams will call for a vote on it. \n\nThe Mayor’s Office said it is reviewing the legislation.",

        "text": "A super PAC backing Zohran Mamdani allegedly offered a top Hispanic business leader a job as an NYC commissioner and a spot on the transition team — if he could raise up to $1 million in three days prior to the mayoral election, sources told The Post.\n\nFrank Garcia, chairman of the New York State Coalition of Hispanic Chambers of Commerce, claimed he got the stunning “pay-to-play offer” from Irfan Verjee on Oct. 17 — three weeks before the election Mamdani won decisively.\n\nVerjee, the CEO for the renewable energy firm Shomax Energy, sits on the business advisory council for OneNYC, a political action committee that raised $508,100 to buy ads backing the socialist pol’s mayoral bid.\n\nGarcia and a third person at the meeting — who asked to remain anonymous — said Garcia shot down Verjee’s request three separate times over coffee at 5 Acres Restaurant in Rockefeller Center.\n\n“I yelled out, ‘Absolutely not! I am not going to ‘pay to play!’” Garcia, 56, recalled during an interview Friday.\n\n“We were talking over each other. The Puerto Rican in me got excited because I’m not going to go to jail for anybody.”\n\nGarcia claimed he was tapped for the meeting because of his success bringing down food costs for minority-owned supermarkets and bodegas through a “buying group” he created that purchases in bulk — and his concerns over Mamdani’s “Soviet-style” plan to bring city-owned-and-operated grocery stores to the Big Apple.\n\nVerjee allegedly at first asked Garcia if he was interested in being the city’s next commissioner of small business services, but Garcia said he didn’t want the $227,786-a-year job or any other job in a future Mamdani administration.\n\nInstead, Garcia said he’d prefer being involved in picking the next commissioner as part of Mamdani’s transition team and helping revise policies for bodegas and supermarkets to be certified as “minority-owned businesses” to qualify for benefits that come with it.\n\nVerjee then “asked me if I’d be interested in chairing the transition team’s Committee [on Small Businesses and Minority- and Women-owned Business Enterprises], and I said if it’s going to help me help small businesses I am willing to do it,” Garcia exclusively told The Post.\n\nGarcia was initially “led to believe” by Verjee that he’d be part of the committee if he endorsed Mamdani – which the business leader said he planned to do anyway.\n\nToward the end of the sitdown, Verjee asked “how much money” Garcia could raise, Garcia claimed.\n\nGarcia said he reminded Verjee that it is illegal for nonprofits like his chamber group to fundraise for political campaigns — and added he is the process of stepping down as chairman to run a proposed super PAC that will raise cash to boost minority businesses.\n\nThe future PAC could potentially raise $500,000 to a $1 million in a month, he told Verjee.\n\nVerjee allegedly insisted he needed the money within three days in exchange “for a seat at the table” to help decide future policy in a Mamdani administration, according to Garcia and the witness.\n\nVerjee didn’t vocalize the sum, the two recalled, but given the context of the conversation they understood his demand to mean $500,000 to $1 million in three days.\n\n“I asked him three times to clarify because I couldn’t believe it,” said Garcia. “I was in shock. I’ve never had anyone working with a campaign approach me that way.”\n\nHours after the meeting, Verjee sent the third attendee, a business leader representing the Asian community, a text asking if she could help broker peace with Garcia, adding it “will benefit all of us” if Mamdani becomes mayor.\n\n“I genuinely need your help as I don’t want to deal with a street hustler,” added Verjee, according to the text viewed by The Post.\n\nGarcia was so enraged over the slur that he wrote a Nov. 13 letter to Mamdani outlining his “shock” over it — and what he called the “pay-to-play offer” Verjee made.\n\n“This statement is not only deeply offensive to me personally but also to the thousands of Hispanic and minority entrepreneurs I represent,” wrote Garcia.\n\nHe also told Mamdani the incident “raises serious concerns about the sincerity of your administration’s commitment to inclusion and fairness” and demanded a private meeting within two weeks with the future mayor. \n\nGarcia decided to go public with his allegations after Mamdani failed to respond.\n\nCampaign finance laws bar a candidate’s campaign from coordinating with super PACs or other outside “independent expenditure” groups supporting that candidate. \n\nHowever, leaders of such fundraising machines can be part of transition teams if their favored candidate wins.\n\nOneNYC’s head honcho Yasser Salem was among the 400-plus, far-left Mamdani supporters appointed Monday to the mayor-elect’s 17 “transition committees.” Salem, a partner for the private investment group Hira Ventures, sits on the powerful Committee on Economic Development and Workforce Development.\n\nVerjee was not appointed to any of the transition committees. He also was never affiliated with Mamdani’s campaign — just the super PAC.\n\nVerjee and Salem did not return messages. \n\nMonica Klein, a spokesperson for Mamdani’s transition team, said it “is not affiliated with or represented by anyone named Irfan Verjee — and any suggestion otherwise is completely false.”\n\n“Anyone making such a claim stands in direct opposition to our commitment to transparency and ending corruption in government,” Klein said.\n\nOneNYC wasn’t the only super PAC that supported Mamdani’s mayoral run.\n\nNew Yorkers for Lower Costs raised more than $3 million, predominately from deep-pocketed, out-of-state donors, records show.",

        "text": "In recent weeks, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promised that the forthcoming revised U.S. Dietary Guidelines—spearheaded by his agency alongside the Department of Agriculture—will be released in December. As the deadline approaches, holiday hosts could be feeling understandably queasy about how thoroughly food policy now intrudes on what we serve and how we eat.\n\nThe dietary guidelines are revised every five years, and they've seen their share of controversy. In the past few decades, the federal government scrapped the infamous food pyramid (which allegedly could be making a return) and has notoriously issued poor dietary advice on more than one occasion. In the 1980s, the federal government urged Americans to shift away from saturated fats and meat and toward carbs. Under the food pyramid—unveiled in 1992—Americans were further encouraged to eat less animal fats and consume copious amounts of bread and cereal. Americans did not get healthier, and obesity rates skyrocketed. \n\n\"It's not as if we're suddenly eating a lot of lentils and kale,\" Yale School of Medicine's David Katz told the Huffington Post back in 2017. \"We replaced the fat with low-fat junk food.\"\n\nEnter RFK Jr., who argues that America's food system is corrupt and \"poisoning\" Americans with hyper-processed additives. He advocates for increased saturated fat consumption—even recommending turkey deep-fried in beef tallow.\n\nRFK Jr. has pledged that the new release will be only four to six pages long, as opposed to previous iterations that have run hundreds of pages—overlooking the fact that the current version includes a four-page consumer brochure alongside the full report. The collective backlash is already forming as we head into the holiday season, with one nutritionist predicting \"substantial chaos.\" Progressives can't decide how to handle RFK Jr.'s approach—some of which they agree with, despite still largely opposing him.\n\nAll levels of American government are increasingly elbowing their way into a seat at our dinner tables. During his mayoral candidacy, New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani argued for government-run grocery stores as an answer to food insecurity and affordability.\n\nBeyond the economic folly of such an idea, government-run grocery stores would only further politicize food. A government that operates a grocery store is also a government that decides what food to stock on the shelves.\n\nWhile urban progressives might feel comfortable letting the Mamdanis of the world make those decisions, would they feel the same about RFK Jr. or a future similar bureaucrat calling the shots on what Americans can eat? \n\nIn the past year, New York City progressives have also been busy pushing a bevy of other food-related policy initiatives. A recently introduced city council bill would require all restaurants in the city to add warnings to high-salt and high-sugar foods on their menus. This mandate has already been in place for larger chain restaurants in the city for years, despite scant evidence that such warnings change what anyone orders.\n\nRed states have seen their share of politicized food controversy. Various parts of the Florida government are unable to decide whether they advise for or against raw milk. Florida, Texas, Alabama, and North Carolina, among other states, are also attempting to ban lab-grown meat products from being available to residents. \n\nSeveral years ago, celebrity chef José Andrés declared: \"Some of life's greatest bridges are built over simmering pots and shared plates…we open possibilities for understanding that transcend political divides.\" In 2025, it seems even a shared plate can't escape the reach of politics.",

The list also included Haiti, which last week qualified for the World Cup. Exemptions, however, were promised for \"any athlete or member of an athletic team, including coaches, persons performing a necessary support role, and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event as determined by the secretary of state.\" The White House did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

I love the people of Boston. And I know the games are sold out, but the mayor is not good. There are worse than her. At least she's intelligent. You know, some are extremely low IQ.

        "text": "WASHINGTON – JD Vance has a lot riding on next November's midterm elections.\n\nThe vice president is seen as the front-runner to be the next Republican nominee for the White House, yet he faces the more immediate challenge of being one of his party's leading messengers as the GOP tries to hold its six-seat majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nFor Republicans to be successful, Vance is warning endangered lawmakers that they need to motivate the working-class voters who helped President Donald Trump take back the White House and don't typically show up in non-presidential elections. That challenge was reflected in Republicans' poor showing in the recent Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races, which Democrats won by wider margins than their 2020 presidential victories in those same states.\n\n\"I think that's one of the lessons that we learned in Virginia and New Jersey ‒ is that when Donald Trump is not on the ballot, you've got to give people something to actually believe in, something to be inspired by, to get out there and vote,” Vance said during a recent event with Breitbart News. “They're not going to vote just because you have an R next to your name.” \n\nRepublican victories nationwide would be a useful springboard for Vance's expected White House campaign, which he has said he will discuss with Trump after the midterm elections.\n\n“I think he's right to be worried about next year,” said Matt Bennett, a former senior adviser to former Vice President Al Gore and an executive vice president at the center-left think tank Third Way. “What we don't know beyond next year, when we get to 2028, is whether that Trump coalition holds together without Trump. And there's evidence that it will not.”\n\nA collapse of Trump’s coalition next fall would present a major challenge for Vance, 41, just as he begins to gear up for his anticipated 2028 presidential bid. He's a newer politician who’s had less time than his recent predecessors to develop a record to run on. He’ll be heavily reliant on Trump’s legislative successes and his involvement in them in a campaign for higher office. \n\nThe former Ohio senator was in office for two years before being elected vice president. He has fashioned himself as someone with the ability to bind old-guard Republicans, MAGA and swing voters together without alienating any one constituency. His ability to do so now and in the future will be tested, as he leads the administration’s midterm messaging push on domestic policy and acts as the finance chair for the Republican National Committee.\n\nHe can’t do it alone: Trump has to campaign in areas where Republicans need a heavy turnout from his supporters, GOP strategists say.\n\nMore: JD Vance is Trump's top messenger. This could be the VP's hardest sell yet.\n\n“I think JD sort of hit the nail on the head there,\" in his comments to Breitbart, T.W. Arrighi, a former press secretary for the National Republican Senatorial Committee and several House lawmakers, told USA TODAY. \"But I also think Donald Trump is going to have to be more involved. He's going to have a big role to play, even though he's going into his sort of lame duck years.”\n\nVance has been cautioning Republicans about complacency since last summer. He said in an early September interview on Fox News with Lara Trump that a pollster for the president told him that anger often wins midterm elections.\n\nThat presents a problem for Republicans next year, he indicated, because “our people aren’t angry.” The left is “very angry right now, and they’re very motivated,” he reflected.\n\nThat motivation gap could be seen in Virginia, New Jersey and California, where a ballot measure backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom passed. In New York City, energy on the left was visible in the high-turnout victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani.\n\nRepublicans have branded Mamdani a “communist” over his pledges to provide free services to New Yorkers and held him up as the national face of the Democratic Party in hopes of energizing their base.\n\nTrump undercut that approach when he embraced Mamdani in the Oval Office during a joint press conference with the rising progressive star. \"I think you’re going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor,\" Trump said.\n\nVance faces an uphill climb\n\nSince the early November election losses, the White House has waged a messaging war aimed at convincing a skeptical public that Trump is doing everything in his power to bring down prices, even rolling back some of his tariffs. He’s been weighing an expansion of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that were at the center of the government shutdown that ended earlier this month.\n\n“We get it and we hear you, and we know that there’s a lot of work to do,” Vance said at the Breitbart event. “As much progress as we’ve made, it’s going to take a little time for Americans to feel that.”\n\nThe push has done little to improve voter sentiment about Trump or the economy. Trump's 41% approval rating in a November Fox News survey is the lowest of his second term and below former President Joe Biden’s at this same point in his term, when it was 44%.\n\nMore: Vice President JD Vance, brawler for Trump, avoids Harris and Pence mistakes\n\nMore than three-quarters of voters view the economy negatively, according to the Fox News poll. Even among Republicans, 42% said Trump was responsible for the current economic conditions, compared with the 53% who blamed Biden, the administration’s frequent boogeyman.\n\nNone of that bodes well for Republicans. Democrats had a net gain of 40 House seats in 2018, when Trump was last in office, and they took control of the lower chamber. Republicans won it back in 2022, during Biden’s presidency, with a net gain of nine seats. Democrats performed better than expected that year and Biden’s party narrowly retained control of the Senate.\n\nBiden’s subsequent decision to run for reelection turned out to be a “catastrophic error,” Bennett said, calling the results a “false positive” for the Democrats. \n\n“You can easily overinterpret the results of midterms, as they relate to the next presidential,” he said. “However, it's not good for Vance if they lose big.”\n\nThe same could be said of Virginia and New Jersey, said Jahan Wilcox, a longtime Republican strategist who worked in the first Trump administration.\n\n“I think if Republicans run with Trump, he has the ability to help get people across the finish line,” Wilcox said. “And often forgotten is that in 2018 he expanded his majority in the Senate.”\n\nRepublicans gained two seats in the Senate that year. GOP strategists say that in 2026, the party has a good chance of repeating that performance.\n\nBut their House majority is in serious jeopardy. Democrats need to win an additional three seats to win control. With the majority in the House, they’d be able to stymie most of Trump’s agenda.\n\n“There will be nonstop investigations and administration officials will have to testify or risk being charged with contempt of Congress,” said William Galston, a senior fellow at Brookings who worked for Gore's presidential campaign. “So he has all sorts of reasons for jumping in feet first.”\n\nArrighi, the GOP strategist, said Democrats “could shoot themselves in the foot” with an investigation-heavy approach and end up being a foil for Vance. “There's also a chance that Donald Trump would be open to negotiating on a number of really big issues to sort of sew up his legacy,” he said. \n\nBut he added, “We don't want to go down that road if we can avoid it.”\n\nInternal fighting divides Trump's base\n\nSensing danger, one of the president’s most prominent allies, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, abruptly quit Congress on Nov. 21 after fighting with Trump over his opposition to releasing the government’s files on the late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. She was critical of his policy of issuing visas to foreign workers with certain skill sets and the amount of energy he was putting toward international affairs.\n\nThe MAGA influencer, who's viewed as a possible challenger to Vance, tied her departure to a potential blowout for Republicans in the midterms. She said they wasted their legislative majority, and when they \"likely lose the midterms, it will become total and complete political war and gridlock.\"\n\n“What is the convincing message for 2026 and likely 2028?\" she asked in a Nov. 24 social media post. \"It will be the American people asking candidates, 'what tangible thing have you done for me and how did it or will it make my life better?' And then actually trying to get them to vote after both parties have failed them.\"\n\nGreene was not alone in her complaints. A dispute within the conservative movement over Tucker Carlson’s interview of Nick Fuentes, a far-right white nationalist with a history of making racist and antisemitic remarks, and a Trump administration proposal to end the Russia-Ukraine war that has been criticized as too favorable to Moscow, have also divided the base.\n\nNeither Trump nor Vance has disavowed Fuentes. In a recent post on X, Vance assailed the “beltway GOP,” and “the political class” in Washington, who he said should be more fired up about crime in America or the cost of healthcare and housing than a war in eastern Europe.\n\nAt the Breitbart event, Vance said Republicans should have their debates in podcasts and op-ed pages, but he urged them to “focus on the enemy” rather than internal divisions.\n\nHe argued later in his remarks that working-class voters who have joined the coalition don't care what Republican orthodoxy was 25 years ago, and they are pushing the GOP in a different direction.\n\n“We need to lean into this new coalition,” Vance said, “do a better job serving them, and that's how we get them to show in these midterm elections, so that we can win.”",

        "text": "NEW YORK − Following his shocking upset to the Democratic establishment, New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is reaching out to skeptics before taking office.\n\nAfter winning on a progressive platform to address affordability in the nation’s largest city, the democratic socialist has continued to mend fences with powerful figures to his right.\n\nMamdani, 34, takes office on Jan. 1, and he appears to to be trying to address concerns around his age, lack of experience, and a progressive leading the city, with a transition filled with veterans of past City Halls and a diverse sounding board.\n\nAnd he's backing Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi's handpicked successor, against challenge from the left.\n\nHe did make one divisive comment, taking a shot at pro-Israel activity, but subsequently condemned phrases ushered by pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nMamdani goes to Washington\n\nMamdani requested a White House meeting with President Donald Trump to focus on addressing cost of living.\n\n\"I will meet with anyone, I will speak to everyone, so long as it can stand to benefit an economic agenda for New Yorkers,\" Mamdani said before the Nov. 21 Oval Office event.\n\nMamdani has called Trump and a \"fascist\" and a \"despot,\" but in person he emphasized his interest in working together on affordability.\n\nThe charm offensive seemed to work, at least momentarily. Trump has threatened to cut funding to New York City if Mamdani was elected. But in person Trump said he’d like to see Mamdani succeed in his hometown.\n\nIntervenes on Jeffries’ behalf\n\nMamdani then opposed a primary challenge to unseat House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York. \n\nCity Councilman Chi Ossé, a left-leaning 27-year-old Democrat from Brooklyn who supported Mamdani's candidacy, filed on Nov. 17 to form a campaign committee running against Jeffries, who resisted endorsing Mamdani until the last minute.\n\nDemocrats on the left have had problems with Jeffries over his support for Israel and his perceived inability to take on Trump.\n\nThe New York Daily News reported Mamdani went to the New York City Democratic Socialists of America’s Nov. 19 endorsement forum to ask the group not to back Ossé’s run.\n\n“This is not a question of the ballot box, of who would you rather vote for,” Mamdani later told the leftist podcast, “The Majority Report with Sam Seder.\" “This is a question of how you want to spend the next year. Do you want to spend the next year fulfilling the agenda at the heart of this movement, or do you want to spend it defending the caricatures of that movement?”\n\nInstead, he wants activist energy focused on achieving his agenda, including to freeze rents on rent-stabilized units, fast and free buses and universal free child care.\n\nOn Nov. 22, NYC-DSA members reportedly voted in a citywide electoral working group not to endorse Ossé by a narrow vote. Ossé told reporters he wouldn’t challenge Jeffries without DSA's backing. Ossé didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn NBC’s “Meet the Press\" a day later, Mamdani said if Democrats take control of the House in the 2026 midterm elections, he would support Jeffries remaining the party leader, which would make Jeffries speaker of the House.\n\nMainstream transition\n\nMamdani's transition advisors includes seasoned municipal administrators who served under de Blasio and current Mayor Eric Adams, as well as the anti-trust scholar Lina Khan, who chaired the Federal Trade Commission under former President Joe Biden.\n\nMamdani also announced over 400 appointments to 17 transition committees that will provide personnel and policy recommendations. While the body has a handful of fellow DSA members and grassroots organizers focused on tenant rights and racial justice, it included established union heads, as well as representatives from the real estate and finance industries.\n\nMembers include Kathy Wylde, considered a billionaire whisperer who leads the business organization Partnership for New York City, as well as Carlina Rivera, a former city councilwoman who now leads the New York State Association for Affordable Housing, a nonprofit trade group representing developers.\n\nOn Nov. 26, the City Council’s speaker’s race appeared to be over as Councilwoman Julie Menin, a moderate from Manhattan's wealthy Upper East Side, said she had enough support to lead the 51-member body.\n\nMamdani’s spokesperson Dora Pekec said Mamdani looks forward to working with her and the council to deliver on “our affordability agenda for New Yorkers.”\n\nWalking back an anti-Israel comment\n\nIn another test, Mamdani, an outspoken critic of Israel, had to respond to a Nov. 19 pro-Palestinian protest outside a Manhattan synagogue.\n\nThe religious space hosted an event by an organization that promotes Jewish immigration to Israel and the occupied West Bank. News outlets reported chants included “death to the IDF,” referring to the Israel Defense Forces, and “globalize the intifada,\" which many interpret as a call for violence against Jews even outside of Israel. Protesters at one point reportedly blocked the entrance to the temple.\n\nWhile discouraging language used by the demonstrators and saying New Yorkers should be free to enter houses of worship, Mamdani reportedly said places of worship should not be violating international law, referring to illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank. His comments drew swift pushback from many Jewish groups, saying he was quick to blame the synagogue instead of condemning demonstrators.\n\nDays later, he issued a new statement in the New York Times. He said he'd protect First Amendment rights while making it clear nothing justifies calling for \"death to\" anyone. The language was unacceptable, he said.\n\nOn the way to his meeting with Trump, Mamdani spoke with the synagogue's rabbi and his son, also a rabbi and a prominent Mamdani critic.\n\nEduardo Cuevas is based in New York City.

        "text": "At first glance, the photographs of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his entourage outside New York’s City Hall suggest nothing other than a joyous public celebration. Taken on December 17, 1964, just one week after the civil rights leader had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway, Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. is seen formally receiving King as though he were a visiting head of state. Later that day, Wagner awarded the city’s Medallion of Honor to King, praising him as “a great American who has returned home after a great triumph abroad.”\n\nBut a few details about the photographs — published here for the first time — make clear that the person behind the camera harbored a far less flattering impression of King. That’s because the prints are held in the New York City Municipal Archives files of the Bureau of Special Services and Investigations, the New York Police Department’s former political intelligence unit, where I found them while researching for my new book, “Police Against the Movement.”\n\nOn their face, the images are mundane. King emerges from a car, greeted by two men in suits. In another, King stands with family and confidants, including his wife, the activist Coretta Scott King; his mother, Alberta Williams King; and his friend and adviser Bayard Rustin, organizer of the March on Washington. In a third shot, Coretta shakes hands with Wagner.\n\nOne thing unites the images: None of the 14 individuals who appear at close range betray the slightest hint of recognition that their picture is being taken; no one looks directly at the camera. Their lack of acknowledgment suggests that they may not have realized they were being photographed — certainly not by police. But their placement in the Bureau of Special Services “Red Squad” files make the NYPD’s sentiments clear. (These files were first discovered by city archivists in a Queens warehouse in 2016, more than three decades after the landmark Handschu federal court settlement mandated they be made available to the activist subjects of NYPD surveillance, and two years after a lawsuit by historian Johanna Fernandez called for their release. Today, the NYPD “Red Squad” files represent the most significant collection of publicly accessible police intelligence records in the United States.)\n\nFor the NYPD, Wagner’s public flattery of King mattered much less than the unfavorable comments made just one month earlier by the nation’s premier law enforcement official, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. Speaking to a group of reporters in November 1964, Hoover condemned Martin Luther King Jr. as “the most notorious liar in the country,” skewering the civil rights leader for his suggestion that the Bureau only reluctantly investigated segregationist attacks on civil rights activists. Hoover’s comments may seem quaint in our current era — in which politicians launch profanity-laced fusillades at their opponents and the president of the United States posts AI-generated videos depicting him as a fighter pilot bombarding No Kings protesters with raw sewage — but that insult succeeded in further delegitimizing King and the civil rights movement in the eyes of law enforcement officials. Wagner might have overtly praised King, but police in New York covertly surveilled him. They could care less what their mayor thought, because they worshipped the FBI director as the nation’s top cop.\n\nJust as Donald Trump demonizes leftist organizers today as domestic terrorists, both federal officials and local police in the South and North condemned civil rights activists as rioters and insurrectionists. Just as Trump falsely disparaged Zohran Mamdani as a communist in recent months (before opting not to repeat the charges in a surprisingly friendly meeting with the mayor-elect in the Oval Office), Southern officials slandered King as a communist. And just as Trump’s Justice Department is indicting his political enemies on legally specious mortgage fraud charges, state officials in Alabama unsuccessfully indicted King on felony criminal charges for income tax perjury in 1960.\n\nBut the NYPD — nor any other local police department — did not need to wait for encouragement from the feds to spy on King and his allies. A common misperception is that local police were content with physically assaulting protesters while leaving the sophisticated work of surveillance and slander to Hoover’s FBI. But police were far more experienced in spying on and sabotaging activists than we have acknowledged — so much so that the FBI’s notorious COINTELPRO program against “Black extremists,” launched in August 1967, should be recognized for federalizing efforts that local police departments had already undertaken to disrupt the civil rights movement.\n\nLong before Hoover denounced King as a liar, the NYPD issued a surveillance report on the civil rights leader’s visit to Harlem in 1958, with other memos to follow in the early 1960s. Rank-and-file organizers supporting King received unwanted attention as well. As they prepared for the March on Washington — now widely celebrated across the political spectrum as a shining moment for democracy thanks to King’s “I Have a Dream” speech — attendees were monitored by the NYPD, as they were by the police departments of Birmingham, Chicago, and Philadelphia.\n\nPolice agencies did not limit themselves to surveilling civil rights activists. They also deployed the weaponry of deception and disruption in hopes of crippling the movement. When Herb Callender, a Congress of Racial Equality chapter leader, confronted police violence with street protests in New York in 1964, BOSS dispatched the undercover spy Ray Wood to infiltrate the Bronx organizer’s inner circle. Wood ultimately coaxed his newfound activist friends into a ludicrous scheme to perform a citizens’ arrest on Wagner, the mayor, at City Hall — which got Callendar arrested and landed him in the Bellevue psych ward.\n\nThen, in December 1964, just three days before BOSS photographed King, Wood made contact with associates of the tiny Black Liberation Front collective. In short order, he encouraged three activists loosely connected with the group to join him in an outlandish plot to bomb the Statue of Liberty. Wood prodded the men for weeks and talked one of them into taking into his possession a box of dynamite purchased with department funds, which triggered the activists’ swift arrest. Glowing headlines detailing Wood’s efforts appeared on front pages across the country, and coverage included a photograph of Wood receiving a promotion for the work, his face carefully turned away to protect his identity. At that point, the FBI assumed control of the case, and federal prosecutors indicted the men on felony charges. All three were convicted on the basis of nothing more than Wood’s word and the box of dynamite, and each served time in federal prison.\n\nThe prosecution of these activists was a watershed moment where the feds and NYPD recast the broadly tolerated liberal civil rights movement that they secretly spied on into the dangerous radical extremist movement they publicly indicted on felony charges — all of which clearly anticipated not only COINTELPRO, but also today’s coordinated local–federal attacks on so-called antifa activists and domestic terrorists.\n\nThese surveillance tactics are of more than just historical significance. Local police continue to deploy weapons of political espionage against movements for justice to this day. In Trump’s first term, police in Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Portland, and Chicago surveilled the same racial justice activists disparaged by the president.\n\nThere’s little reason to think that such investigations will cease. Protesters against ICE and Israel’s war on Gaza draw continued law enforcement monitoring — not least of all in New York, where the outgoing mayor has echoed the president’s criticisms of protests against ICE as attacks on law enforcement, and local organizers have increased their calls for the NYPD to disband its Strategic Response Group, a secretive unit that continues the work of BOSS by attending protests and conducting surveillance.\n\nWords matter. Federal authorities who vocally attack protesters telegraph to law enforcement agents that they would be mistaken to not monitor and probe activists. Insults and slander give way to surveillance and invasions of privacy, which in turn lay the foundation for harassment by public officials, and in some cases result in criminal proceedings.\n\nTime will tell which actions the federal government will take against the activists that they have recently branded as terrorists. But we can’t lose sight of the actions of the local law enforcement agencies that look to the feds for guidance — and we must recognize that the untruthful words of a president, no matter how far-fetched, have real-life consequences for the activists on the receiving end.",

        "text": "The housing market keeps getting worse. Home prices have risen more than 50% since the pandemic. About a third of American households now spend more than 30% of their income on housing. In 2014, the median age of a first-time homebuyer was 31. In 2025, it was 40 — the highest on record.\n\nThe core of the problem is simple: Too much money chasing too few homes. How many more homes does America need? I’ve seen estimates ranging from 2 million to 5 million. It’s a shortage decades in the making — and one we’re nowhere near on track to solving. In 2025, America built fewer homes per 100,000 people than it did in 2005, 1995, 1985 or 1975.\n\nEvery White House since President Barack Obama’s administration has recognized the need to build more homes but the results, under both Democrats and Republicans, have been anemic. Housing is a hard problem to solve from the Oval Office. Zoning and building rules are set at the state and local levels. Interest rates are set by the Federal Reserve. In 2024, Kamala Harris promised to build 3 million new homes and released a plan that no housing expert I spoke to thought could come anywhere near achieving that goal.\n\n“ The thing that I think we learned is that federal housing policy is stuck in a really weak equilibrium,” said Jared Bernstein, who led President Joe Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers. “There is just far too little asked of cities and states. They won’t do much to push back on the barriers that are blocking affordable housing.”\n\nBernstein, who is now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, wants to change that. He’s among the authors of a new housing plan that tries to deliver the next administration a set of solutions nearer to the scale of the problem.\n\nFederal incentives\n\nAt the core of the center’s plan is an idea it calls “Rent Relief for Reform.” I don’t love the name, but I like the idea: Places with a housing shortage — and that’s a lot of them — get a choice. Build the housing and the federal government will give all the renters in the city up to $1,000 off their rent — or don’t build the housing and lose access to certain federal grants.\n\nThe Searchlight Institute, a new Democratic think tank, recently proposed a similar idea. In that version, cities and other places that hit ambitious housing targets would qualify for a federal rebate that would give every household — so both homeowners and renters — a check equal to the average increase in rent over the last year. In other words, build enough housing and the federal government will give the people who live near that housing money.\n\nBoth those ideas are trying to solve the hard problem at the heart of housing politics: It’s the people who already have homes who have a voice in local politics and planning. They often like their neighborhood the way it is. They don’t want more traffic or new neighbors or the hassle of nearby construction. What’s in it for them?\n\n“You can put this kind of crassly as you’re incentivizing renters to show up at local elections and push their elected officials to do things that are renter-friendly, which I don’t hate as a strategy,” said Jenny Schuetz, who leads housing policy at Arnold Ventures. “If most renters showed up in the primaries and demanded that their mayor and City Council actually do good things, we could have some pretty different outcomes. But mostly renters don’t show up — particularly in the primary — and so you get these homeowner-dominated coalitions in cities that make it hard to build.”\n\nModular housing\n\nThe other big idea in the Center for American Progress plan is to change the way we build housing in America. “If you go back to 1910, somebody showed up with a toolbox and a hammer to build a house,” Bernstein said. “And if you go to 2025, it’s the same damn thing. This is the one sector where productivity has been literally falling for five decades while everything else has been going up.”\n\nThe comparison that often gets made here is to manufacturing. Between 1950 and 2020, productivity in the manufacturing sector — how much you could produce with the same number of workers — rose by more than 900%. That’s a big part of why everything from tables to televisions is cheaper today than decades ago. But over the same period, productivity in the construction sector has fallen. That’s not the only reason housing is so expensive today, but it’s part of it.\n\nBut you can manufacture housing — constructing homes in an off-site factory much the way we construct cars and then shipping them for final assembly. This is technology pioneered in the United States when George Romney, Mitt Romney’s father, served as secretary of housing and urban development during the Nixon administration. But the United States never figured out the rules nor the financing to make an industry out of it. Instead, it’s taken hold elsewhere. In Sweden, for example, more than 40% of new homes — and more than 80% of single-family homes — are fabricated off-site.\n\nThe Center for American Progress’s plan proposes a slew of projects to take this industry America invented and make it one where America is a leader. They want the government to seed a major research program to fund innovation in housing construction. They want to have the federal government leverage its purchasing power to become an initial buyer for modular housing — one idea here would be to have the Department of Defense upgrade its military base housing using modular construction. They want to modernize building codes to make modular easier — removing, for instance, an outdated federal requirement to attach a permanent steel chassis to all modular construction — and updating federal insurance and financing rules to make sure modular production qualifies.\n\nUnaffordable housing\n\nYou could imagine states and cities acting even before the federal government does. “New York was once a beacon of creative, public sector-led, affordable housing production,” says Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s housing plan. “But decades of disinvestment and shrinking government capacity have left us waiting on the real estate industry to solve a housing crisis from which they profit.”\n\nLeft unsaid in his plan is that publicly subsidized, affordable housing has become monstrously expensive to construct because the public money triggers rules and process and reviews and negotiations that market-rate housing doesn’t contend with. A Rand study found that, per square foot, affordable housing cost more than 1.5 times as much to build in California as market-rate housing; a Washington Post investigation revealed an affordable housing development in D.C. where the units cost $800,000 each to build, even as the same developer was building market-rate units for $350,000 next door. One reason we don’t build enough affordable housing is we’ve made affordable housing unaffordable to build.\n\nMamdani proposed investing $100 billion to build 200,000 “publicly subsidized, permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes” over the next decade. That works out to $500,000 per unit — if all goes well. What if New York City became a test case for how modular construction could allow public housing, ordered and built at massive scale, in unionized factories, to become cheaper and faster to build than market-rate housing? If it was only $350,000 per unit, that would mean building almost 300,000 units for the same cost.\n\nOne problem the modular housing industry has faced is the absence of steady demand to keep the factories running and work out the kinks of construction. A place like New York City that wanted to build public housing at scale, over a long period of time, could create that steady demand and use it to seed an industry — New York could become America’s leader in modular construction.\n\nPerhaps that’s fanciful. But our thinking on housing — both public and private — has been far too small for far too long. We’ve accepted shocking cost increases paired with stagnating productivity. We’ve made it impossible for tens of millions of families to build the lives they want in the cities they’d ideally choose. At this point, making it possible to build more housing just isn’t enough. We need to change how we build housing. I don’t know if modular housing is really the answer. But it’s worth trying.\n\nEzra Klein is a New York Times columnist.",

        "text": "Memo to Wu.\n\nIt does not work that way, Michelle.\n\nYou, the mayor of Boston, do not ask the President of the United States to meet with you. You ask to meet with him.\n\nThat is what leaders of countries around the world do when they want to sit down with President Donald Trump, the most powerful leader in the world. They ask to come to the White House.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy comes to Washington. Trump does not go to Kyiv.\n\nIt is also the way Zohran Mamdani, the Democrat Socialist mayor-elect of New York, got to meet with Trump in the White House last week. He asked for the meeting.\n\nNow, if you were Kevin White, the late flamboyant four-term (1967-1984) imperial mayor of Boston, who considered himself a national figure, it might be different.\n\nNot for nothing was he dubbed “the Mayor of America.”\n\nHe also had the swagger to pull such a public relations stunt off.\n\nWhen he finally left office, he did not leave any swagger behind. He took it with him, which is why no mayor since “Kevin from Heaven” has matched his national renown.\n\nBut that was four mayors (and one acting mayor) ago, and times have changed.\n\nSwagger is out and socialism is in, and socialism makes for strange bedfellows.\n\nAlso, socialists have no swagger because they, like panhandlers, are always looking for a handout.\n\nWhich is why Mamdani, a Muslim Democrat Socialist, got to the White House to meet with Christian Republican capitalist President Trump. He went in search of a handout.\n\nTalk about the odd couple: a capitalist who made millions through an open and free market economy and a socialist who wants to take those millions away to distribute to people who did not earn them.\n\nYet they had something in common, and it was that both are winners.\n\nDespite all odds, both came from behind to win campaigns few thought they could– Trump back in 2016 and 2024 and Mamdani in 2025.\n\nTrump likes winners. And despite Mamdani’s off-the-wall socialism, Trump was impressed with Mamdani’s victory, noting how he doggedly rose in the polls as his New York campaign developed.\n\n“He really ran an incredible race against some very tough people, smart people,” Trump said of his new friend. He added, “The better he does the happier I am.”\n\nMichelle Wu also ran an incredible race, so incredible that she ended up with no November opponent after she trounced Josh Kraft in the primary and he threw in the towel.\n\nBut she got no kudos from Trump who probably did not notice in the first place. Boston, after all, Boston is no New York. No place is.\n\nWu, however, has been dogged and consistent in her criticism of Trump, particularly over his crackdown on illegal immigrants, criminal and otherwise in Boston, a sanctuary city.\n\nWhich she is entitled to do as mayor.\n\nHowever, she is somewhat coy and disarming when it comes to visiting Trump at the White House.\n\nShe said, Kevin White-like, that she would turn down an initiation– that she did not get in the first place—and would only accept one t under her terms anyway.\n\n“I would accept the invitation if it came with a promise to stop snatching residents illegally off the streets, stop prosecuting his (Trump’s) political enemies, stop cutting life-saving research and funding…Sure, I would be open to a conversation at that point.”\n\nKevin White would have added that the meeting take place at City Hall and not the White House.\n\nBut White took the swagger with him when he left the building.\n\nVeteran political reporter Peter Lucas can be reached at: peter.lucas@bostonherald.com",

There are also the extrajudicial killings in international waters.”\n\nThe British were horrified by Trump’s 28-point peace plan, which gives the United States compensation for any peace guarantees it provides and a share in the profits generated by infrastructure projects in Ukraine funded by frozen Russian assets. \n\nBritish lawyers, said Zirin, were “bewildered” by the Supreme Court’s shadow docket, “where summary orders that are said to be interim become law without explanation, opinion, or even revealing which justices voted for the final decision.”\n\nAnd in a Europe that has replaced a British prime minister four times in eight years and a French prime minister five times in the past two, people are shocked by how easily an American autocrat can gather and keep power. In Europe, the ministers are unquestionably the servants, and people connected to Jeffrey Epstein are ousted by the royal family. They are not kept in the White House to scream tweets and drive policy.\n\nBut now Zirin said Europe is noticing Trump slipping in the polls, stunned by fissures within his MAGA ranks and shaken by Democratic gains in the recent election. Trump is suddenly pivoting, changing his position on releasing the Epstein files. After labeling Zohran Mamdani a “communist,” Zirin said Trump now tries to align with Americans who voted for the New York mayor-elect, and he publicly supported Mamdani earlier this month.\n\n“[T]here is some cause for optimism,” said Zirin. “Looking at the signs of recent events, we see what was once unimaginable just a few months ago. Trump may be losing his hold on the Republican Party.”\n\nOne of the most telling signs was the recent announcement by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, (G-Ga.) that she is resigning her House seat rather than allowing herself to be treated by Trump like “a battered wife hoping it all goes away and gets better.” \n\nInflation is battering Trump’s record, and ruining the party that gives him complete fealty. \n\n“The latest poll numbers show that Trump’s approval is below water. Only 33 percent of U.S. adults approve of how he is managing the government, down from 43 percent in March,” said Zirin.\n\n“As John Lewis, the great civil rights leader and Congressman, famously said, ‘Democracy is not a state. It is an act.’ Trump is blinking; hope may be on its way,” Zirin said.\n\nSee the Washington Monthly report at this link.",

        "text": "SACRAMENTO — In the run-up to New York City’s mayoral election, Donald Trump let loose with one of his signature, ill-tempered social-media rants, where he complained that Democrats “have crossed the line” by nominating Zohran Mamdani. Trump described him as “a 100% Communist Lunatic. We’ve had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous.”\n\nAlthough I wish Trump would at least occasionally act presidential, I chuckled at this one. Democratic leaders actually were troubled by Mamdani’s rise (although their preference for a disgraced former governor was equally dismaying), but Democratic voters handed Mamdani a solid victory despite his radical positions. Some of those include rent freezes, city-run grocery stores, a massive minimum-wage hike, government-financed housing projects and free public transit.\n\nSo it was much to my surprise — and virtually everyone else’s — that Trump invited the mayor-elect to the White House. It was even more surprising that the confab turned into a kumbaya session, with the two men smiling and glad-handing. After the meeting Trump’s tone toward the “communist lunatic” softened, as the president said, “It was a Great Honor meeting Zohran Mamdani, the new Mayor of New York City!” The happy talk was amazing.\n\nThe reactions were predictable, but entertaining. Some lefties were outraged, with a socialist web site already dismissing Mamdani as just another capitalist politician. There’s a reported break between progressive camps, with the latest fracas revolving over support — or lack thereof — for a primary challenge to Democratic House leader Hakeem Jeffries. I suppose the Trump meeting reinforces Mamdani’s role as a member of the pragmatic lunatic left.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic strategist Michael LaRosa said on Fox & Friends Weekend, “Seeing those guys yuck it up, talk about housing, where they agree on housing, where they agree on crime, exchanging compliments over social media, Mamdani talking about how they share some of the same voter coalition. I, as a moderate common-sense Democrat, loved it.” That group of Democrats sees Mamdani as having scored a political victory by charming the president.\n\nThe cognitive dissonance on the right was equally hilarious. “I had to drink a bottle of ginger ale today after seeing Mamdani in the Oval Office because it physically nauseates me seeing Islamic jihadists infiltrate our government and continue to get a pass to promote Islamic jihad and anti-American values with zero push back,” posted MAGA activist Laura Loomer. But other Trump supporters praised the president’s commitment to New York City and his four-level chess abilities or whatever.\n\n“What this episode truly reveals is that Donald Trump believes political rhetoric to be as real as professional wrestling, a work of kayfabe,” wrote Jeffrey Blehar in a sensible take at National Review. There’s some truth there, given the president’s knack for theatrics. But take a look at the president’s meeting with Vladimir Zelensky, where he tried to humiliate him. The president continues to blame the Ukrainian president for having the audacity to have gotten his country invaded.\n\nThen there’s Trump’s recent White House meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It was extraordinarily warm, with Trump giving the prince a pass on Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s horrifying death and dismemberment at the Saudi consulate in Turkey in 2018 and referring to it in the passive voice: “things happen.” Trump isn’t chummy with everyone who visits — only with those with whom he shares a certain affinity.\n\nTrump gave the obvious answer to why he and Mamdani hit it off during their meeting: “[W]e agree on a lot more than I would have thought.” Go back to LaRosa’s comments, too. The two men talked about affordability and the bizarre overlap in their voter coalition. Many of their specific policies differ, of course, but they are both advocates for big-government solutions. They both seek centralized power to issue edicts. They both are authoritarians who appeal to a sense of grievance. They both disdain limits on their powers.\n\nThis is the dictionary definition of the Horseshoe Theory, where extremes on the right and left are not divided at the far ends of a long line but at the ends of a horseshoe. Populists on both sides believe in an activist government, although they have different motivations. As fundamentally collectivist, both movements are remarkably similar.\n\nSo here we are where the so-called “communist lunatic” and the so-called “fascist” find common ground. We’re close to the point where our country needs an intervention.\n\nSteven Greenhut is Western region director for the R Street Institute and a member of the Southern California News Group editorial board.

        "text": "Baylor SpearsWisconsin Examiner\n\nOriginally published on Wisconsin Examiner. \n\nThe Wisconsin Assembly met for its final floor session of 2025 Wednesday, where Democratic lawmakers sought to pass a bill that would extend Medicaid coverage for new mothers for one year after the birth of a child, though Republicans blocked it. Bills to encourage school district consolidation and make changes to elections laws passed.\n\nRepublicans block Democratic efforts to get a vote on postpartum Medicaid bill \n\nWisconsin is one of two states in the U.S. that have not taken the federal government’s postpartum Medicaid expansion, and Democratic lawmakers hoped to begin the process of changing that during the floor session. \n\nThe bill, which passed the Senate in April on a 32-1 vote, would allow eligible mothers to keep their Medicaid coverage for a year postpartum. Currently in Wisconsin, mothers only get 60 days of coverage if they don’t otherwise qualify for Medicaid.\n\nAssembly Democrats planned to employ a rarely used Assembly rule to pull the bill out of committee and bring it up for a vote. Under the rule, if 50 lawmakers sign a petition, a bill can be brought to the floor. Democratic lawmakers hoped to have the chance to convince some of the Republican cosponsors of the bill to sign on.\n\nBefore that could come to fruition, however, the Assembly clerk notified Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) of the plan, Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) told reporters. \n\nRepublicans moved the bill from the Assembly Rules Committee, where it had sat since May, to the Assembly Organization Committee — triggering a rule that says a withdrawal petition on the bill cannot be circulated for 21 days. \n\n“This is a great effort by the Speaker to prevent this important bill from getting a vote on the floor,” Neubauer said. \n\nNeubauer said she didn’t know why the clerk notified the Assembly Republican leaders.\n\n“There had been some conversation with staff about the timeline for [the petition], but I’m not really sure why it happened the way it did,” Neubauer told reporters. She said that Rick Champagne, director of the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau, told the lawmakers that notification should have happened when they turned the petition in with the 50 signatures, not prior to the petition circulating.\n\nAll 45 Democratic lawmakers are cosponsors of the bill as are over 20 Republicans, but the bill has been hung up in the Assembly due to opposition from Vos, who has said in the past that he doesn’t support expanding “welfare.” The bill only needs a simple majority of 50 votes to pass the Assembly.\n\nNeubauer read out the names of the Republican cosponsors during the press conference. \n\n“These are legislators who believe that this bill should become law, so they say, but they have been bullied by their speaker into not pushing for a vote on this bill on the floor,” Neubauer said. “Frankly, Robin Vos’ move to prevent us from circulating this petition and his refusal to bring this bill to the floor is pathetic, and when moms in Wisconsin and their babies are put at risk, their health and well-being is put at risk, because they do not have adequate health care in the year after they have given birth, it will be Robin Vos’ fault.” \n\nThe Republican lawmakers on the bill include Reps. Patrick Snyder (R-Weston), Jessie Rodriguez (R-Oak Creek), Scott Allen (R-Waukesha), Elijah Behnke (R-Town of Chase), Barbara Dittrich (R-Oconomowoc), Bob Donovan (R-Greenfield), Cindi Duchow (R-Delafield), Benjamin Franklin (R-De Pere), Rick Gundrum (R-Slinger), Nate Gustafson (R-Omro), Dean Kaufert (R-Neenah), Joel Kitchens (R-Sturgeon Bay), Rob Kreibich (R-New Richmond), Scott Krug (R-Rome), Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc), Dave Maxey (R-New Berlin), Paul Melotik (R-Grafton), Jeff Mursau (R-Crivitz), Adam Neylon (R-Pewaukee), Todd Novak (R-Dodgeville), Kevin Petersen (R-Waupaca), David Steffen (R-Howard), Rob Tusler (R-Harrison), Chuck Wichgers (Muskego), Rob Wittke (R-Caledonia), Rob Summerfield (R-Bloomer), Calvin T. Callahan (R-Tomahawk), Clint Moses (R-Menomonie) and Joy Goeben (R-Hobart). \n\nDemocratic lawmakers also tried to introduce amendments to a bill on the floor that would have extended postpartum Medicaid coverage, but those were also blocked by Republicans.\n\n“It shouldn’t be this hard to get Republicans to do the right thing. Wisconsin women deserve access to quality, affordable health care and that includes postpartum care,” Vining said before she was cut off by Speaker Pro Tempore Kevin Petersen who said she wasn’t on topic.\n\n“This is a disgrace,” Vining yelled out.\n\nSchool district consolidation \n\nDemocratic and Republican lawmakers split over a package of bills that would encourage school districts to consolidate. Republican lawmakers argue the bills are necessary due to falling enrollment, which they say is the reason for school districts’ financial struggles. \n\nRep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) said at a press conference that the bills would address declining enrollment and the cycle of repeatedly going to referendum to raise money from local taxpayers that school districts are in. Schools in Wisconsin have seen a drop of about 53,000 students over a decade, from the 2013-14 to 2022-23 school years.\n\nOf Wisconsin’s 421 school districts, about two-thirds are struggling with declining enrollment with preliminary numbers from the Department of Public Instruction showing that enrollment for public school districts in the 2025-26 school year fell by about 13,600 students. Total enrollment across Wisconsin school districts is about 759,800 this year. \n\n“Districts with declining enrollment receive less in state aid and to make up for that revenue loss. We’ve seen a growing cycle of constant referendums with varying degrees of success,” Nedweski said. “Wisconsin taxpayers are frustrated with our public school system… They are frustrated with districts continuously asking them to raise their own taxes, frustrated that their generous investments have not produced matching results.”\n\nDemocrats blamed Republicans for school districts having to go to referendum, noting that state aid has not kept pace with inflation in nearly two decades. They also said Wisconsinites have not been asking to close schools. Neubauer said Republicans were “proving how disconnected they are from our constituents.”\n\n“Wisconsinites do not want to close school buildings, break up their communities, force their kids to ride on the bus for hours a day, or lose their local sports teams. Wisconsinites want us to fund our public schools,” Neubauer said. “Republicans’ push to close schools misses the mark completely, and Wisconsinites deserve better… Don’t close schools, fund them.”\n\nAccording to the Department of Public Instruction, Wisconsin is spending the least, proportionally, in state revenue that it has ever spent on schools under the current funding formula. About 32.1% of state general purpose revenue goes to state general aid to schools, while that percentage used to be around 35%.\n\nRep. Angelina Cruz (R-Racine) noted during floor debate that many school districts lost state aid this year. Data from DPI for the 2025-26 school year shows that of 421 districts, 71% — or 301 districts — will receive less state aid this year compared to the prior year and 26% will receive more.\n\n“For 15 years, Wisconsin has intentionally divested in our public schools while expanding privatization through voucher schemes,” Cruz said at a press conference, adding that Racine Unified School District has felt the loss of revenue acutely.\n\nAccording to DPI data, about 15% of Racine’s revenue limit — or $43 million — goes to pay for voucher program participants.\n\n“Since 2011, our community has gone to referendum three times — in 2014, 2020 and 2025 — asking residents to raise their own property taxes to provide what the state has refused to fund,” Cruz said. “Even after those referendum paths, our district has been forced to close and consolidate schools including… the school where I grew up as a teacher. This is not about a lack of community commitment. It is about the state failing its constitutional obligation to provide free and as nearly uniform as practicable schools to children… Let me be clear, if there is money to close public schools, there is money to fund public schools.”\n\nRep. Joel Kitchens (R-Sturgeon Bay) rejected claims that the choice program is to blame.\n\n“That’s a tiny little percentage of this,” Kitchens said. “It’s happening because of declining birth rates, of people choosing to have less kids, waiting long to have kids. I can’t imagine how anybody can look at our 421 school districts that we have right now and think that in 30 years, that’s going to be sustainable.”\n\nKitchens also emphasized that the bills are voluntary.\n\n“Let’s trust our communities to work through these things and decide for what’s best for themselves,” Kitchens said. \n\nRepublicans also rejected Democratic lawmakers’ insistence that the state needs to invest more money in its public schools. \n\n“[Democrats] want us to believe that if we simply spend more on K-12, people will flock to Wisconsin and increase enrollment,” Nedweski said. She compared Wisconsin to New York, which according to the New York Focus spends more per public school student than any other state. “Their outcomes are no better than ours, and they are losing students even faster than Wisconsin. As they elect more communist leaders like [New York City Mayor-elect] Zohran Mamdani, I suspect more New Yorkers will rapidly leave tax-and-spend Democratic Socialist policies. More spending is not a strategy, it’s denial.”\n\nNedweski said the bills are a “lifeline” for school districts that can use it and will encourage savings and “invest in increasing opportunities for students who may not otherwise have access to things like AP classes, world languages, advanced tech ed and specialized learning services.”\n\nThe six bills in the package:\n\nAB 644 would increase additional state aid to schools that consolidate in 2027, 2028 and 2029 to $2,000 per pupil in the first year. Under current law, school districts receive additional aid when they consolidate. For the first five years after consolidation, a consolidated school district gets $150 per pupil. In the sixth year, the aid drops to 50% of what the school district received in the fifth year and in the seventh year, the aid drops to 25% of the fifth year. It passed 53-44 with Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers) joining Democrats against the bill. \n\nAB 645 would provide grants of up to $25,000 to groups of two or more school district boards for the costs of a feasibility study for school district consolidation or whole grade sharing agreements. It passed on a voice vote.\n\nAB 646 would launch a study of Wisconsin’s school districts, looking at current school district boundaries, potential school district consolidations, existing school district facilities, staffing levels and salary scales, the population of school-age children in each school district, and revenue limits and current overall spending. It passed 54-43 along party lines.\n\nAB 647 would create a four-year grant program for school districts that enter into a whole-grade sharing agreement, agreeing to educate students at one location. School districts would get up to $500 per pupil enrolled in a single grade. It passed 54-43 along party lines.\n\nAB 648 would help create new supplemental state aid for consolidated school districts to address differences in school districts’ levies when they merge. The measure is meant to address concerns of higher property taxes for residents of low-levy districts when a consolidation takes place. It passed 54-43 along party lines.\n\n AB 649 provides the funding for the bills, including $2.7 million for grants to schools that enter whole-grade sharing agreements, $3 million to provide state aid to offset levy limit differences and $250,000 for feasibility studies. It passed 54-43 along party lines.\n\nVote on online sports betting bill delayed\n\nAfter being fast tracked through the public hearing process, a vote on a bipartisan bill that would legalize online sports betting in Wisconsin was postponed. \n\nThe Wisconsin Constitution requires that gambling in the state must be managed by the state’s federally recognized Native American tribes. Following that requirement, sports betting has been allowed in Wisconsin since 2021, but bets have had to be made in person at tribal casinos. \n\nAB 601 would expand this to allow for online sports betting anywhere in the state by placing servers running the betting websites and apps to be housed on tribal land; this is known as a “hub and spoke” model. It was introduced in October and received hearings in the Assembly and Senate earlier this month. \n\nAssembly Majority Leader Tyler August (R-Walworth) said that he still would have had the votes on the bill if it had come up for a vote, but he had conversations with members of his caucus over the weekend that brought new issues to his attention. He would not provide details on what the concerns were, though he said they didn’t deal with issues of constitutionality.\n\n“I’m not going to get into the details of the conversations that I’ve had with members,” August said. “We’re just working through some of that right now, and I’m confident that there’s no rush on this. It’s the right thing for the state, and I’m confident that we’ll get there.”\n\nNeubauer said she planned to support the bill. \n\n“We know that our tribes in Wisconsin have the right to control gaming in our state, and right now, that’s not happening with online sports betting,” Neubauer said. “I do hope that we pass a bill that puts control of that industry back in their hands.”\n\nThe Assembly passed and concurred in a total of over 50 bills. Others include: \n\nAB 596 and AB 597, which passed unanimously, would direct $1.9 million to be used for a state grant match program for veterans’ housing. A nonprofit group would need to be participating in the federal program, which currently provides about $82 per day per veteran housed to groups that offer wraparound supportive services to homeless veterans, to be eligible for a state matching funds of $25 per day per veteran. While no one voted against the bills, Democratic lawmakers expressed concerns that the bill would not fill the gaps that currently exist due to the closure of two Veterans Housing and Recovery Program sites earlier this year. \n\nAB 602, which would instruct Evers to opt into a federal school choice program, passed 54-44 along party lines. \n\nA pair of bills meant to help address students who are disruptive in class passed in 54-43 votes. AB 613 would require principals to provide written notification to parents every time a student is removed from a class and “the quality or quantity of instructional time provided to the pupils in the class is diminished.” AB 614 would add language into state law to say that teachers are allowed to maintain order in the teacher’s classroom, establish and enforce classroom rules, call 911 in an emergency, take immediate action if a pupil’s behavior is dangerous or disruptive and request assistance from school administrators during a disruptive or violent incident.\n\nAB 207, which would provide information about constitutional amendments to voters including their potential effects, passed on a voice vote.\n\nAB 312 passed on a voice vote. It would require absentee voting sites to be open for at least 20 hours during the period for voting absentee in-person.\n\nAB 385 passed in a 55-42 vote with Rep. Lori Palmeri (D-Oshkosh) joining Republicans in favor. The bill would prohibit a political committee, political party or conduit from accepting contributions that are made with a credit card online unless the contributor provides their credit card verification value (CVV) or code and the billing address associated with the card is located in the United States. Republican state lawmakers introduced the bill following efforts by Republicans and the Trump administration to target ActBlue — a Massachusetts-based platform that processes donations to Democratic campaigns.\n\nAB 617 passed 53-44. Rep. Paul Tittl joined Democrats voting against the bill. It would make a number of changes to elections law, including requiring that alternate absentee ballot sites must be in a building or facility constituting a fixed location and requiring absentee ballots with faulty or missing certifications be returned to voters if they are received seven days before the election. It is similar to a bill introduced last session, but it does not include a provision that would have allowed for Monday processing of absentee ballots. Rep. Scott Krug (R-Rome) said that he is speaking with the Assembly Elections Committee chair about potentially having an informational hearing on Monday processing.",

        "text": "Back-from-the-cancelled graveyard comic Louis C.K. is gearing up for what sources tell RadarOnline.com will be his most aggressive stand-up tour yet, with the comedian preparing to turn his long-running grievances into on-stage fodder aimed squarely at critics who tried to bury his career.\n\nOnce one of the most influential names in American comedy, C.K. – born Louis Alfred Székely – saw his professional life collapse in 2017 after admitting to multiple allegations of sexual misconduct.The 'Revenge Tour' PersonaThe fallout was swift – film deals evaporated, his television projects were scrapped, and venues that once clamored for his presence abruptly cut ties. \n\nNow, as the 58-year-old gets set for a new tour of the U.S. and Britain, slated to span much of next year, industry sources say the comedian is planning to lean fully into a persona forged in controversy, personal tumult, and an increasingly defiant view of his critics. \n\nA source close to the tour's development claimed: \"Louis is raging that people tried to erase him, and he's ready to hit back on stage. He sees this tour as his chance to settle scores, not quietly but loudly.\" \n\nAnother insider added: \"He's not doing a redemption arc – he's doing a revenge tour. He thinks that's what his audience wants.\n\n\"He's writing like a man who thinks he has nothing left to lose. He keeps saying nobody canceled him hard enough to keep him off a stage. Louis now wants to mock every person who ever mocked him. He's not going to be hiding that.\"New Public Relationship Marks 'Un-Cancellation'C.K.'s re-emergence comes as his personal life is again thrust into the spotlight. The comedian was recently photographed in New York City kissing Mimi O'Donnell, the longtime former partner of the late actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, who died in 2014 aged 46 from a drug overdose. \n\nO'Donnell, now Spotify's head of scripted fiction, shared a 15-year relationship and three children with the Capote star before his death. \n\nShe has kept her private life largely out of public view since then. A source said, \"Louis is relying on Mimi more than people realize. She gets what it means to face loss, public scrutiny, and starting over, and they bond over experiences most folks will never encounter.\"\n\nThe sighting of the pair smooching has led insiders to tell Radar the comic is \"now fully un-cancelled\" as he re-enters public life with a bang. \n\nTheir very public display of affection in the Big Apple – which saw the new couple walking arm in arm with a small dog as C.K. placed his hand on the back of O'Donnell's head during a kiss – marks the first time she has been linked to a romantic partner since her 15-year relationship with Oscar-winning actor Hoffman.\n\nOne source close to the pair said: \"For Louis, this is more than a relationship – it's a signal that he considers himself back in the world again. People around him see this as the moment he believes his cancellation is over – he's now basically un-cancelled, and Mimi will help his comeback.\" \n\nAnother said: \"Mimi has kept her private life completely locked down since Philip died, so this surprises everyone. But they looked comfortable and happy – and that says a lot.\"C.K.'s Dating History RevealedO'Donnell, who shared three children with Hoffman, Cooper, 22, Tallulah, 18, and Willa, 16, has maintained a low public profile outside her political involvement in New York, where she campaigned early for Zohran Mamdani during his successful run for mayor. \n\nIn April, she appeared in his first television ad, saying: \"I love a progressive candidate. He's got the energy. I love free child care, free buses. I like all the stuff he's said.\" \n\nC.K., born Louis Alfred Székely, was previously married to Alix Bailey from 1995 to 2008 and has two children. \n\nHis dating history post-divorce has included Fiona Apple, Sarah Silverman, Blanche Gardin, and Dasha Nekrasova, though none have sparked comparable scrutiny to his new relationship.The 2017 Downfall and ComebackThe comedian's downfall began in November 2017, when he was faced with sexual harassment allegations from five women, several of whom said he masturbated in front of them without consent. \n\nThe following day, he released a statement acknowledging the accounts were accurate and apologizing for the harm caused. Within weeks, his professional projects dissolved. \n\nDespite fierce debate over his return, C.K. slowly resumed touring in 2019. More recently, he defended performing at a Saudi comedy festival, insisting he had the right to work where he chose.",

You picked a winner here.”\n\nBonchie, writer at RedState: “She didn’t have cancer. She was murdered. By a Muslim from Afghanistan. Just for existing.”\n\nBrianna Wu, former U.S. House candidate: “Note the passive language. She wasn’t murdered by an Islamist Afghan terrorist, ‘she passed.’ This man is a machine to whitewash terrorist propaganda.”\n\n@DreaMGriff28: “She was murdered. Do not disrespect her by making it sound like she passed peacefully in her sleep.”\n\nCouncilwoman Vickie Paladino (District 19, NYC): “Narrator: He wasn’t actually devastated.”\n\nGoldie Ghamari, political analyst: “Jihadi Tactic 101: manipulating language to minimize and whitewash Islamic terrorism. Sarah Beckstrom didn’t just randomly ‘pass away.’ She was murdered in cold blood on American soil by an imported Muslim terrorist who shot her while yelling ‘Allah-o Akbar.’ Words matter.”\n\nJim T. Reacher, writer: “She didn’t ‘pass.’ She was shot by a guy screaming ‘Allahu Akbar.’”\n\nNoam Blum, podcaster: “If you didn’t know about this story, you might have thought she died of cancer based on how vague this is.”\n\nIan Miller, writer at Outkick: “Gotta hand it to Mamdani for completely avoiding mentioning how Sarah Beckstrom died. Just a deeply dishonest, profoundly fake person.”\n\nC. Weber: “They are globalizing the intifada… like you suggested.”\n\nTziporah HaLevi: “When Gazans are buried under the rubble of a building used by Hamas to cover their tunnels from which they engage the IDF, they’re victims of a genocide by Jews. When a Muslim uses a pistol to point-blank shoot to kill an American, she ‘passes’. NYC — this is your new Mayor.”\n\nDrew Pavlou accompanied his commentary with a graphic featuring multiple screenshots of Zohran Mamdani’s previous posts on X. These included Mamdani’s statements on policing, mass incarceration, traffic fatalities, and the Israel-Hamas conflict: “When an Islamic extremist executes a National Guard soldier in cold blood, Zohran refuses to mention how the victim died. They just ‘pass away.’ But Zohran accuses American police of murder all the time. He denounces prisons for MURDERING ‘black and brown people.’ He denounces motorists for unleashing an ‘epidemic’ of murder and violence on cyclists. He of course denounces Israel and the United States for murder across the Middle East. Just strange that he can’t bring himself to express a similar level of moral outrage when Islamic extremists murder people. Strange.”",

        "text": "Nearing Christmas, I often wonder how Christianity has become so institutionalized that its founder, Jesus of Nazareth, is almost an afterthought while his popularizer, the Pope, is busier than ever. The originator (Jesus) and the popularizer (Pope) represent the same ideas of Christianity; but, more often than not, the institutionalized version is so compromised by the reality in which it must exist that the original form is hardly detectable in the popularized version. \n\nJesus, the original-revolutionary founder speaks his ideas and leaves the stage, but the later popularizers, like popes, must spread the ideas in a way acceptable to multitudes. The problem is that we cannot traverse from the original revolution to later popularization without compromise and corruption, often to a point unrecognizable by the founder. \n\nJesus was simple and his disciples were honest; but the pope’s institution today is highly personalized and politicized with factions within fighting for their own interests and powers. Jesus lived among his people and talked to them; our popes — in an institution surrounded by thick walls and armed guards, immersed in archaic titles and protocols, live like feudal kings. Human history is replete with examples of the founders’ purity severely tainted, even forgotten, by the process of institutionalization and the power-play of its keepers. \n\nTake the example of the Declaration of Independence compromised into the Constitution of the United States. The Founders composed the Declaration purely as their ideals — such as in “all men are created equal” — conceived from their simple hearts. By the time the declared ideals were codified as the Constitution a decade later, the original ideals were pretty much muted into the demands of practicality as the Constitution had to be approved by practical men. Thomas Jefferson and his fellow writers could only declare their intentions of the heart. (Jefferson’s first draft even had a sweeping denunciation of slavery, which his colleagues vetoed as too radical). But the Constitution was a blueprint with which they had to actually build a real society in a real world.\n\nThe distance between Declaration and Constitution is about as wide as that between the founding generation and today’s largely corrupt compromisers and politicians, for whom every ideal is a deal first. New York City’s Jeffersonian mayor Zohran Mamdani must fight the housing oligarchs to lower their rents without quoting Jefferson’s declaration of equality, America’s first principle, now drowned in the sea of capitalism. \n\nIt’s inevitable that the road from revolutionaries to popularizers is paved with corruption. As Jesus would not recognize the Catholic Church today as the House of their Fathers, our Founders would not accept our contemporary generations as the rightful inheritors of their American ideals. Jefferson worried about George Washington going soft on the revolution’s radical republicanism; Hitler was unhappy that his victorious Nazi colleagues were forgetting about their radical national-socialist (Nazi) goals; Mao wanted to revive the sagging communists’ revolutionary spirit by turning the Red Guards loose on Chinese society. In every new revolutionary movement — Christianity, liberalism, national-socialism, communism — the original ideas are soon watered down, even abandoned, by their institutional administrators and citizens. \n\nThe founders of any movements — spiritual, political, philosophical — uncompromising and pure at heart — need popularizers to bridge the distance between the epiphany of the movements and their repeats by habit. But as the time-space distance widens between the two — Jesus from Christianity, Jefferson from America — the original purity cannot escape the ensuing compromise and corruption. So Jesus sees his “churches” everywhere but the spirit that fills them is far removed (institutionalized) from his original commandment. In American politics today, it’s doubtful that Thomas Jefferson and his cohort would find any kinship with our democracy practiced in their name. \n\nSome more contrasts are instructional: Henry David Thoreau, the purest and most demanding soul in New England, thought his fellow transcendentalist and popular speaker Ralph Waldo Emerson had become corrupted in popularity; disappointed with Emerson, Thoreau quit the group. \n\nJohn Brown, the abolitionist, could not persuade Frederick Douglas, who was a popular celebrity-speaker in Boston, to join him in the armory attack; the attack failed and Brown was soon hanged; Frederick Douglas lived comfortably for three more decades while John Brown’s death inspired the Civil War.\n\nMalcolm X was the uncompromising radical who would accept only pure-hearted whites as true brothers; but Martin Luther King Jr., the popular preacher, compromised with white society to be more acceptable; and today, white America shuns Malcolm X’s pure heart, MLK is showered with honors and celebrations, and quoting something from “Dr. King” is fashionable among liberals. \n\nPopes, the vicars of Christ, could not even theatrically imitate Jesus; nor could modern American politicians or their voters imagine the Founders’ perfect union; nor could Emerson live like Thoreau; nor could Douglas die a martyr’s death like Brown; nor could MLK be true like Malcolm X. Beholden to their social institutions and realities, not to the original callings of the heart, popularizers can only pretend, not replicate, what they enact. To paraphrase Lord Acton: Popularity corrupts and institutionalized popularity corrupts more absolutely. Unsurprisingly, just now, Santa Claus and Christmas trees have overtaken Christ himself in importance. \n\nHow do we escape from this corruption trap? We must all become revolutionaries, 1776 style, and overthrow our present yoke: Rejecting “paganized-commercialized” Christmas is a start. We must save Christmas — and our own souls in the process — from the unremitting carnival straight from Sodom and Gomorrah that it has become. \n\nJesus would be the first to appreciate a simple but solemn prayer from our heart instead of extravagant gifts and loud parties concocted by our own money-changers in their den of thieves. \n\nJon Huer, retired professor and columnist for the Recorder, lives in Greenfield and writes for posterity.",

        "text": "With the year winding down, 2025 has left many top Democratic figures wishing things had turned out differently — or maybe that the public had put its focus elsewhere. Here are the top political turkeys ripped by conservatives in the past year. Chuck Schumer Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has received scorching criticisms from Republicans and Democrats alike in the wake of a 43-day government shutdown that left Democrats empty-handed. Democrats led by Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., had refused to advance spending legislation to keep the government open past Oct. 1 without first considering extensions to supplemental funding for Obamacare. But by the end of a painful and highly visible shutdown — the longest in the country’s history — Republicans had rebuffed efforts to negotiate over the subsidies. Without an off-ramp or negotiating strategy, even the chamber’s most progressive members expressed doubts about continuing the shutdown. \"I just don’t get what the point is of delaying even longer,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said just moments after a key vote to reopen the government cleared the Senate. Many Democrats in and out of Congress blamed Schumer for failing to either keep Democrats united in their standoff over the subsidies or for failing to deliver on some other sort of concession. Across both chambers on Capitol Hill, Schumer faces questions about his continued role as the party's leader in the Senate. CHUCK SCHUMER BECOMES TOP TARGET FROM MEDIA PERSONALITIES AMID SHUTDOWN FALLOUT Kamala Harris The country’s worst kept secret got a fresh coat of paint in 2025 when a groundbreaking book by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios reporter Alex Thompson took readers behind the scenes of President Joe Biden’s physical decline — and the effort to hide it. Questions about what Vice President Kamala Harris knew about Biden’s cognitive state rebounded in the wake of the book’s publication. Harris — who maintains that Biden could have served out another term — would eventually take his place as the Democrat on the ticket in 2024. At the time, Harris’ stand-in for Biden was seen by many in the party as the obvious choice. But that view soured later when President Donald Trump stormed to victory in November and questions arose about whether Harris should have joined the calls for Biden to step down. KAMALA HARRIS DOESN'T RULE OUT ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN NEW INTERVIEW: ‘I AM NOT DONE’ The autopen The presidential walk of fame at the White House features portraits of every president — except one. Instead of President Joe Biden, the Trump administration put up a picture of an autopen, a device used to mimic the signature of someone else, symbolizing President Joe Biden’s reliance on his inner circle to make presidential-level decisions. The House of Representatives launched an investigation into just how much of his power Biden decided to delegate. In a report put out in October, the House Oversight Committee slammed the Biden administration for what it called \"invalid executive actions.\" \"The report exposes how President Joe Biden’s top advisors, political operatives, and personal physician concealed the President’s mental and physical decline from the American people. The findings reveal that as President Biden’s condition deteriorated, his aides exercised presidential authority and facilitated executive actions without his direct authorization,\" the report states. Questions remain about just how far Biden's use of the autopen went and whether the legal standing of sensitive decisions like pardons could receive a second look. Andrew Cuomo The former governor of New York attempted a political comeback in 2025 by running for New York City mayor. The bid, which came after disastrous management of the state’s nursing home facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic and sexual harassment allegations during his time as governor, did little to improve his political standing. Cuomo failed to capture the Democratic Party nomination, ultimately losing out to Zohran Mamdani by 7.7 percentage points. Refusing to call it quits, Cuomo launched an independent campaign. There, Cuomo again fell behind Mamdani — this time by almost nine points. In addition to a personal loss, Cuomo’s defeat dovetails with questions about whether more traditional Democrats can still compete with the vision offered by far-left figures in the party. \"This campaign was necessary to make that point – a caution flag that we are heading down a dangerous, dangerous road,\" Cuomo said in his concession speech. \"Well, we made that point, and they heard us, and we will hold them to it.\" FROM AOC TO ZOHRAN MAMDANI, THE DEMOCRATS ARE PEDDLING FAR-LEFT POLITICS Chuck Schumer — again Schumer’s woes over the shutdown weren’t the only sore spot for the Senate minority leader in the last few months. The meteoric rise of Zohran Mamdani put this year’s biggest political turkey in a pressure cooker he could not escape. He first faced questions about Mamdani in the lead up to the New York mayoral primary. Then reporters began to ask him if he would endorse Mamdani after the self-proclaimed socialist secured the Democratic nomination. And even in the closing days of the race, Schumer faced questions about whether he had made a decision to support the race’s clear front-runner. Through it all, Schumer gave the same non-answer. \"Look, the bottom line is very simple. I have a good relationship with him, and we’re continuing to talk,\" Schumer told reporters less than a week out from the election. While other Democrats, including Jeffries, also delayed in giving responses about Mamdani, Schumer’s refusal to speak on the New York City Mayoral race stands out. Schumer’s dismissal of the topic fueled questions about the direction of the Democratic Party and whether its congressional factions could play along with the momentum of its leftward flank.

That remains true. But at the same time, Gen Z is one of the most polarized generations in American history.\n\nIn 2024, Gen Z—led in part by young activists like Charlie Kirk and Scott Pressler—shifted toward Donald Trump. He won 46% of Gen Z voters—56% of young men and 40% of young women. This led many to expect that a younger, more populist generation would shift the country rightward. But now, in 2025, the self-proclaimed Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani won 78% of the youth vote in New York City—67% of young men and 84% of young women. Far from being locked into any one existing political party, young people are more divided than ever.\n\nOne cause of this is what I call “Nomadic Progressivism.” Kids born between, say, 1997 and 2012 have been thoroughly inundated with progressivism and identity politics from birth.

Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law… You are wrong on the law, and you are wrong on safety.\"\n\nMamdani has said, for his part, that despite the seemingly friendly meaning, he continues to believe that the president is a fascist: \"Everything that I've said in the past, I continue to believe.\"\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Townhall’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

        "text": "“New York cannot fix affordability while ignoring rising flood risk, and it cannot build resilient infrastructure that prices people out.”\n\nThe campaign is over, the ballots counted, and now the hard part begins. Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani ran on a promise to tackle New York City’s affordability crisis, pledging to triple the pace of affordable housing construction, freeze rents, and make housing attainable again. Voters agreed: the ballot measures that passed made clear that New Yorkers see expanding the housing supply as the city’s most urgent challenge. But affordability alone isn’t enough. The floods that took lives and homes last month are a stark warning that resilience must be part of the solution.\n\nThis is why Environmental Defense Fund, Regional Plan Association, the Association for Neighborhood Housing and Development, and Cornell University are taking a new approach that addresses these two deeply intertwined realities. New York cannot fix affordability while ignoring rising flood risk, and it cannot build resilient infrastructure that prices people out. With a new administration preparing to take office, this is the moment for a truly holistic approach that brings housing, safety, and long-term community stability under the same umbrella.\n\nMayor-elect Mamdani’s affordability campaign created a movement, which has led to a mandate for his administration to tackle the housing crisis once and for all. That same movement compels New York City to return to its rightful place as the leader in the fight against climate change. Yet, we live in a moment in which we can no longer treat the intertwined housing, affordability, or climate crises separately as if they require different solutions. They are all intrinsically linked, and we have an incoming administration that has the opportunity to make both a statement by acknowledging this hard truth and an impact by working to solve them for the future of New York. \n\nTo figure out how to do that, we asked a simple but urgent question: how can New York build housing that is both affordable and resilient? Our new report, “Policy Solutions for the Climate and Housing Crisis in New York City,” draws on expert interviews, mapping analysis, and stakeholder workshops to find solutions. The result is a four-part framework for meeting New York’s twin challenges head-on.\n\nWe know the stakes are high because tens of thousands of New Yorkers already face the risk of losing their homes to rising seas and more damaging storms. RPA estimates that 19,000 housing units could be lost to coastal flooding by 2040, displacing more than 40,000 people. Without decisive action, that number is expected to triple by 2070, putting as many as 100,000 New Yorkers at risk. And that loss of stock will only drive up the cost of rents and mortgages for years to come. These figures make one thing clear: affordability and resilience are inseparable parts of the same housing crisis.\n\nHere’s how the City of New York can solve the problem: \n\nFirst, it’s imperative our leaders create a unified, flood-resilient land use strategy. New York currently plans housing, land use, and climate adaptation in silos, which leads to building in high-risk areas while safer neighborhoods remain underdeveloped. Instead of this piecemeal approach, the city needs one framework that directs growth to low-risk areas, limits development in flood zones, and puts equity and long-term safety first. That means assessing housing needs and climate risk together, requiring resilient design for all new buildings, and evaluating the full costs and benefits of developing in high-risk coastal areas. It also means expanding affordable housing and green infrastructure in safer neighborhoods while maintaining affordability, and restoring high risk “blue zones” to manage stormwater.\n\nSuch a comprehensive plan also requires us to safeguard our existing housing stock. Much of the city’s housing is aging and increasingly exposed to flooding, yet retrofit programs are scattered and difficult to navigate. New York needs a one-stop, user-friendly system that consolidates assistance, expands support across housing types, and prioritizes low- and moderate-income households. Streamlined access to grants, loans, and resilient design guidance will help residents stay safely in their existing homes and preserve the affordable housing the city already has.\n\nThis year’s election was nothing short of a referendum on affordability, which is why we recommend creating stability and wealth in safer neighborhoods. As growth shifts to lower-risk neighborhoods, rising rents will push out longtime residents unless protections are in place. To prevent displacement, the city should pair new development with tools that build community wealth and local ownership. Discouraging property flipping, expanding co-ops and community land trusts, and giving tenants and nonprofits first chance to buy buildings will help ensure that safer neighborhoods remain affordable and stable.\n\nFinally, these efforts must be backed by a dedicated resilience fund. New York currently lacks a reliable funding source to protect homes and neighborhoods from escalating flood risks. Coastal infrastructure projects, which are only increasing in volume, depend on inconsistent federal dollars, and local resilience upgrades are chronically underfunded. A dedicated resilience fund is needed to support home retrofits, green infrastructure, and coastal protections through tools such as flood management fees, or development fees, all structured to protect low-income residents. Stable and reliable funding is essential if housing and infrastructure are to withstand the storms ahead.\n\nTogether, these solutions point to a practical, achievable way forward. A new era of ambition and results are sweeping into City Hall at a time when crucial federal funds are treated like a political football. New York City’s leaders can rise above these challenges to overcome the housing and climate crises if we finally acknowledge how intertwined they truly are. \n\nWe have created a roadmap forward for those decision makers to deliver security and affordability all in one. New Yorkers cannot wait any longer for these solutions—the time to put them in motion is now. \n\nAnushi Garg is the Environmental Defense Fund’s senior analyst for climate resilient coasts and watersheds, New York – New Jersey.

        "text": "Zohran Mamdani talked housing policy in the White House, and appointed a transition committee that runs the gamut of housing philosophies.\n\nIt might be the first time the word “ULURP” was uttered in the Oval Office.\n\nMayor-elect Zohran Mamdani went to Washington last week to meet with President Donald Trump. During a surprisingly warm encounter, Mamdani said that he and the president discussed New York’s land use review process (the Uniform Land Use Review Process, or ULURP).\n\n“We had a meeting today that actually surprised me,” said President Trump in a joint address with Mamdani from the Resolute Desk. “He wants to see housing being built. He wants to see rents coming down. All things that I agree with.”\n\n“We may disagree on how we get there,” he added.\n\nThe idea of building more housing in New York City as a way to address the rising cost of shelter has captured many of New York’s elected leaders, Mamdani included. It’s part of the reason he ultimately supported ballot measures earlier this month that changed the ULURP process to make it easier to build. \n\nThe mayor-elect told the New York Times in June that his stance on “the role of the private market in housing construction,” has changed over the years. \n\n“I clearly recognize now that there is a very important role to be played, and one that city government must facilitate through the increasing of density around mass transit hubs, the ending of the requirement to build parking lots, as well as the need to upzone neighborhoods that have historically not contributed to affordable housing production—namely, wealthier neighborhoods,” Mamdani told the paper.\n\nOn Monday, he appointed a diverse coalition of officials to assist with developing a housing policy as he transitions into Gracie Mansion. It included YIMBY voices like Open New York’s President Annemarie Gray, New York State Tenant Bloc leader Cea Weaver, and real estate interests like Real Estate Board of New York President Jed Walentas.\n\n“I joined this because Zohran is committed to the all-of-the-above approach to the housing crisis,” said Gray in a press conference Monday. “One that protects current tenants while also building the homes future families need.”\n\nThe group reflects Mamdani’s sweeping and ambitious housing plans. He’s called for unlocking private market development with zoning reform, having the city finance 200,000 affordable units, and cracking down on bad landlords.\n\nWeaver, in an interview with City Limits earlier this month, expressed her excitement about an election that invigorated public servants clamoring to work with the new mayor—his “resume portal” has seen more than 70,000 applications—and turned out the most voters in a mayoral election since 1969.\n\n“My hope is that this fresh energy of civic engagement, participation, and volunteerism that led to the victory in this election will spin over into the collective project of governing the city,” said Weaver.\n\nHere’s what else happened in housing this week—\n\nICYMI, from City Limits: \n\nTake a tour of “The Hole,” a neighborhood on the edge of Brooklyn and Queens that’s being eyed for major redevelopment.\n\nNew York State is still waiting on federal funds to open applications for HEAP, which helps low-income households pay their winter hearing bills. In the meantime, see if you qualify for another state program that offers utility discounts. \n\n“An estimated 158,214 households are eligible for SCRIE or DRIE—but only 67,132 are currently enrolled. That means nearly 57.6 percent of tenants who could be protected may still face avoidable rent hikes in the months ahead.”\n\nICYMI, from other local newsrooms: \n\nAttorney General Letitia James is suing over the Trump administration’s new rules for a federal homelessness program called Continuum of Care, changes that local officials say would jeopardize housing for thousands of New Yorkers, the New York Times reports. \n\nAG James is also asking NYCHA delay its plan to demolish and rebuild the Fulton and Elliott-Chelsea Houses until the start of the new year, as some residents who need to relocate to make way for the work don’t want to move, Gothamist reports. \n\nA City Council bill wants to bring back SROs, according to 6sqft. \n\nCon Edison is canceling its plans to add e-battery charging stations at NYCHA developments, Streetsblog reports. \n\nThe 70 NYCHA employees charged last year in a wide-ranging bribery case have now all been convicted, ABC News reports.",

        "text": "Mosab Hassan Yousef has seen how terrorist movements build from the inside, as he grew up the son of one of Hamas’s co-founders. Now he’s warning that jihadis are putting the same destructive game plan that turned Gaza into an Islamic terrorist cesspool into action in the United States.\n\nIn a thought-provoking and bone-chilling X post on Nov. 26, Yousef spoke out to warn Americans that Muslim jihadis are as determined to take over America as they are to take over Israel. As Hamas’s backer, the Iranian regime, always said, America is the “Great Satan.” Jihad is not just about the guns and missiles. It is also about the educational initiatives, mosques, propaganda campaigns, and political efforts. Yousef’s warning is particularly timely as an Afghan immigrant just gunned down two National Guardsmen in D.C., and radical pro-Hamas Zohran Mamdani won the New York mayoral election. An Oct. 7 jihadi was also recently found living in Louisiana.\n\nAngry crowd of migrants march through Dearborn, Michigan calling for “Intifada and revolution”pic.twitter.com/7GkpMq0pFW— Breaking911 (@Breaking911) November 27, 2025\n\nYousef began, “From the inside, it looks innocent — just kids at summer camps, families at mosques, neighbors sharing meals. But growing up in the West Bank, I saw only what few did: my father, Sheikh Hassan Yousef, wasn’t just a community leader. He was one of the architects of the Muslim Brotherhood’s project in the territories — a project that would birth Hamas. I was there in our living room when Sheikh Ahmad Yassin came from Gaza to plan with him. Not bombs. Not yet. Just schools, charities, mosques, research institutions. Building trust. Indoctrinating a generation. Waiting.”\n\nThe “prophet” Mohammed is said to have waited for more than a decade indoctrinating followers before he launched his military campaign that would turn into the 1,400 years of Jihad that continues to this day. Like Mohammed, the Muslim Arabs who now call themselves Palestinians built up their movement over time. Yes, there were frequent bursts of terroristic violence against Israel, but nothing on the scale of Oct. 7. That was the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust and was the culmination of years of the sort of “peaceful” orchestration which Yousef is highlighting. And that orchestration went on, not only in Gaza after that was given to Palestinians, but also in Palestinian Authority-controlled areas of Judea and Samaria (the so-called “West Bank”) and Israel proper. \n\nWhen I visited Jerusalem weeks before the Oct. 7 massacre, dozens of shops in the Muslim quarter of Jerusalem itself were selling merchandise showing “Palestine” as all of Israel. It was the genocidal chant “from the river to the sea” in the form of a cute magnet or t-shirt. That’s part of what Yousef means. Then on Oct. 7, 2023, “Half a century of patient preparation detonated in one morning.”\n\nRelated: Poll: 70% of Palestinians Oppose Disarming Hamas\n\nMuslim Brotherhood’s 1991 Explanatory Memorandum: The Strategic Plan for “Settlement” in North AmericaThis document, titled “An Explanatory Memorandum on the General Strategic Goal for the Group in North America,” was written on May 22, 1991, by Mohamed Akram (also known as…— Mosab Hassan Yousef (@MosabHasanYOSEF) November 26, 2025\n\nYousef sketched a graphic picture of how those same tactics used to radicalize the overwhelming majority of the population in Gaza are being used in America now. “That is not ancient history. It is the blueprint — and the same blueprint is already running on American soil,” he warned.\n\nLook at your campuses. “Students for Justice in Palestine” sounds noble, right? Same crowd, different mask. They don’t need to bomb buses here. They lobby, march, guilt-trip, invert reality: turn “Free Palestine” into “Zionists are evil,” turn Jews from fellow citizens into the enemy overnight. Sabotage a multi-trillion-dollar aerospace defense pact with Israel. Fool Americans into thinking Israel is a liability rather than the greatest American asset.Qatar wires billions to American universities and mosques, appoints imams who preach “interfaith” until the megaphone is handed to them—then it’s pure fire against Israel. Same double mask: charity fronts, hugs for the cameras, while underneath they fund hate abroad and fracture you at home.They don’t need tanks. They need ballots. Look at Zohran Mamdani—barely religious enough to qualify as a real Muslim Brother, but they backed him anyway. Why? Power flex. Proof that a tiny, disciplined minority can swing an American city. Next stop: Congress. Senate. Governors’ mansions. Anti-Israel bills multiply. Taxpayers are shamed daily for “funding genocide.” The U.S.–Israel alliance bleeds.\n\nAntisemitism is acting as a gateway drug to Islamic conquest. Some Christians and LGBTQ individuals, who would be among the first persecuted and killed if America became an Islamic dictatorship, side with the Palestinians against the Israelis because they hate the Jews, as Yousef pointed out.\n\nRelated: Muslim Poet Calls Dearborn a ‘Jihadi Capital’\n\nDearborn Poet Muhammad Ali at Shiite Hadi Institute: From UCLA to Columbia to MEMRI TV – You Hear “From the River to the Sea”; When Dearborn Is Called the “Jihadi Capital,” Speak Proudly of “Hassan Nasrallah, the Martyr” pic.twitter.com/DFYd1TfjcO— MEMRI (@MEMRIReports) November 11, 2025\n\nAs of October, at least 80% of Palestinians supported terrorism against Israel. As of March, almost half of young Americans supported Hamas against Israel. In Dearborn, Mich., in New York, in D.C, the jihadis walk and stalk, they call for genocide and cheer terrorists. Both Republicans and Democrats praise jihad apologists and smear Israel. “This is not invasion. This is erosion. They wait for the cracks — riots, recessions, scandals — then push harder. A weakened, divided America fighting itself is their entire goal,” Yousef emphasized.\n\nHe ended ominously: “Because once the living room becomes the battlefield, it’s already too late.”\n\nNote: It's the holiday season, which means PJ Media VIP's Black Friday sale is back!\n\nNow through Monday evening, 11:59 PM ET, receive 60% OFF an annual VIP, VIP Gold, or VIP Platinum membership with promo code FIGHT.",

        "text": "When it comes to homebuying in New York City, Wu-Tang Clan put it best: Cash really does rule everything.\n\nAll-cash buyers accounted for more than 60% of the 17,924 home sales in the five boroughs over the first half of this year, according to a new report from the nonprofit Center for NYC Neighborhoods.\n\nAriana Shirvani, senior program manager at the organization, said all-cash sales tend to favor wealthy people and corporate investors while making it even harder for other New Yorkers to purchase a small piece of the city.\n\n“The report speaks to a deepening inequality in both who can buy homes in New York City and who can keep them,” Shirvani said.\n\nNationally, all-cash purchases made up about a quarter of home sales between July 2024 and June 2025, according to recently released data from the National Association of Realtors. The remaining three-quarters involved buyers who paid some of their own money upfront and took out a mortgage to cover the remainder.\n\nIn New York City, the current scenario is almost the reverse. And the eye-popping rates of cash purchases were especially high in the East Bronx, Queens and other areas.\n\nIn City Council District 13, which includes neighborhoods like Throgs Neck and Pelham Bay, just five of the 325 buyers took out a mortgage to complete their purchases in the first half of the year, according to the Center for NYC Neighborhoods’ review. The rest paid in cash.\n\nQueens had the highest total number of all-cash sales, with 4,132 out of roughly 6,000 total purchases in the borough included in the analysis. For homes that sold for more than $3 million in Manhattan, nine out of 10 buyers paid for the entire property upfront.\n\nThe Center for NYC Neighborhoods, a nonprofit network of homeowner advocates and legal groups, used public property records to analyze sales of one- to four-family homes, including condos and co-ops, in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens from Jan. 1 to June 30, 2025. They excluded Staten Island, which uses a separate recordkeeping system.\n\nCash buyers have a distinct advantage in the housing market because sellers tend to consider them more reliable, with no risk of a lender imposing restrictions on a sale or the loan falling through altogether.\n\n“Cash is king because there are no strings attached,” said Mike Davis, a real estate agent specializing in Brooklyn and Manhattan. “It guarantees certainty for sellers and in this turbulent economy that is 2025.”\n\nDavis, who did not take part in the analysis, said about half of his clients pay for their homes in cash and these sales are typically faster than those requiring financing.\n\nThat reality can benefit homeowners with valuable properties in the city as well as buyers who have been able to save up or use the proceeds of a previous property sale. But it can also favor institutional investors and speculators who are often hard to identify and intend to resell, or “flip,” properties over families intending to buy and live in a home.\n\nThe report finds flipping was especially common in the same East Bronx neighborhoods where cash-buys dominated, along with Jamaica and other parts of Southeast Queens — a trend documented by other researchers.\n\nThe authors say a new state law approved in May could put the brakes on flipping by forcing owners to wait three months before selling to corporate buyers.\n\nThe Center for NYC Neighborhoods and other homeowner advocates are urging state lawmakers to curb speculation favorable to corporations by enacting an ownership disclosure law to reveal the people behind anonymous companies scooping up homes. They’re also calling for a “flip tax\" surcharge on sales made within two years of a purchase. A bill introduced since 2021 by state Sen. Julia Salazar and Assemblymember Catalina Cruz — and co-sponsored by Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani — would impose a hefty fee on sellers: up to 65% of the difference between the purchase and sale price if a home is resold in less than two years.\n\nCenter for NYC Neighborhoods Executive Director Christie Peale said more homeowners may be turning to cash-buyers because they themselves are facing financial distress due to unemployment, stagnant wages and inflation — a situation that could worsen amid a potentially grim economic outlook due to rising costs and uncertainty at the federal level.\n\nThe report also found new foreclosure filings nearly doubled over the first six months of 2025 compared to the second half of last year. Homeowners facing foreclosure are concentrated in low- and middle-income sections of the city, like Central Brooklyn and Southeast Queens, where people of color make up the majority of residents. The same neighborhoods were also the city's locus of the 2008 mortgage crisis, when hundreds of New Yorkers lost their homes to foreclosure.\n\nPeale said the situation has ripple effects because many people who sell property out of financial hardship often turn to rental units for their next home.\n\n“It limits competition in the rental market if people hold on to their homes,” Peale said.",

        "text": "Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman says he has a plan to protect the suburbs from Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s policies: a wall of surveillance cameras and facial recognition technology along Long Island’s border with New York City.\n\nBlakeman, a Republican who is considering a run for governor, spoke of the new security measures in an interview with Fox News Digital.\n\n\"We are doing everything necessary to make sure that Nassau County is safe,\" he said. \"We are installing technology along the border of New York City that will read license plates, that will have facial recognition, that will have video cameras.\"\n\nFacial recognition technology, which is used by the NYPD, has been questioned by civil liberty and criminal justice experts over its accuracy and threats to privacy. A Blakeman spokesperson did not immediately respond to an inquiry.\n\nHe reportedly described Mamdani in the interview as “pro-criminal,” echoing criticisms from Republicans across the country that the mayor-elect will be soft on crime. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, is set to take office on Jan. 1. He’s said he wants police to focus on serious crime and reallocate resources to have social workers respond to mental health emergencies.\n\nBlakeman, an ally of President Donald Trump, just handily won re-election in the county with nearly 1.5 million residents. He has focused on immigration and public safety, making local law enforcement collaborate with ICE. Last year, he called on Nassau County gun owners to create a special armed unit that he said would provide “another layer of protection” for residents. The program is currently facing a lawsuit from opponents who call it an illegal militia.\n\nBlakeman has criticized Gov. Kathy Hochul, as well as the city’s sanctuary policies. Under sanctuary rules, city officials are prohibited from cooperating with federal immigration agents except in cases involving those convicted of serious crimes.\n\n“Governor Hochul made a terrible mistake spending all this money on illegal migrants when we could use them for hospitals, for schools, for infrastructure,” Blakeman said.\n\nSpokespeople for Hochul and Mamdani did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nA gubernatorial run by Blakeman would face resistance from local GOP leaders, who are looking to avoid a primary and pave a winning path for Rep. Elise Stefanik, who announced her bid for governor earlier this month. She has repeatedly criticized Hochul and made Islamophobic attacks against Mamdani.\n\nBut Stefanik’s anti-Mamdani messaging was complicated last week by Trump himself, who had a friendly meeting with the mayor-elect in the Oval Office. Trump said Mamdani was not a “jihadist,” dismissing Stefanik's attack as campaign rhetoric.",

        "text": "Recent victories in the off-year elections has the Democratic Party’s leader feeling smug. \n\n“I never want to hear again that the Democratic Party has a problem with young men,” Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair Ken Martin said at a press conference, according to Politico. “We’re going to keep working hard to keep them in our camp and our coalition, for sure, but we won across the board with every major constituency that left our party last year, and that should tell you something again, that the Democratic Party is back.” (RELATED: As Grocery Prices Remain High, Democrats See Opening And Plan To Spend Eight Figures Wooing Certain Demographics)\n\nMartin reportedly attributed young people’s enthusiasm for the Democratic Party to economic disillusionment, “a sentiment that he thinks voters largely attribute to the Trump administration,” according to Politico. \n\nMartin’s hypothesis has some holes. Is it really likely that swathes of formerly pro-Trump young men were champing at the bit for … Abigail Spanberger?\n\n If democrats want to win over young men – particularly white men – they need to stop actively hating them, demeaning them, and putting up roadblocks (affirmative action, DEI, sensitivity trainings) in the path of their success. It’s not about “the tone.” pic.twitter.com/sC08ubJdAd — FischerKing (@FischerKing64) May 26, 2025\n\nA more plausible scenario: The young men who voted in the off-year elections aren’t the exact same young men who voted in last year’s presidential election.\n\nZohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York City mayoral race is not a bellwether for national sentiment. (RELATED: Five Times Zohran Mamdani Created A Headline For All The Wrong Reasons)\n\nAmong white men aged 18 to 29, Mamdani won 62% of the vote, according to NBC’s exit polls. Among non-college graduate white men, Mamdani won 20% of the vote. Among Republicans, Mamdani won 4% of the vote. Among the 11% of people who consider themselves “part of MAGA,” Mamdani reportedly won 8% of the vote. (I suspect that some Mamdani voters just thought it would be funny to pretend to be part of MAGA.) \n\n “As recently as 2016, more than half of young men (51 percent) identified with or leaned toward the Democratic Party. By 2023, less than four in ten (39 percent) young men identified as Democrats.” @dcoxpolls pic.twitter.com/M2Rua98AUK — Richard V. Reeves (@RichardvReeves) July 16, 2024\n\nMamdani did capture 44% of the independent vote, but in New York City, being an independent is more often a signal of distaste for the moderate elements within the Democratic Party. \n\nGranted, Mamdani’s social media communication was strong. Far stronger than his opponents, and far stronger than the older Democrats who triumphed in Virginia and New Jersey (Gov.-elect Spanberger and Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill, respectively).\n\nAll that to say, I wouldn’t count on young men to usher in a blue wave come 2028. \n\nFollow Natalie Sandoval on X: @NatSandovalDC",

        "text": "Buddhists believe that pain and suffering arise from Earthly desires. The key, they say, is moderation: “Be always moderate, never indulge in excess,” preached the Buddha.\n\nWhich, interestingly enough, makes them extremists about moderation.\n\n(Extreme moderation always struck me as kinda contradictory. Y’know what I mean? Extreme moderation must be one helluva mental Mobius strip.)\n\nIt also probably explains why Buddhism never really caught on as a mainstream global religion. In fact, over the last decade, Buddhism has dramatically nosedived in popularity, dropping from 5% of the world’s population in 2010 to just 4.1% today. \n\nBetween 2010 and 2020, Buddhism was the only major religion to shrink in absolute numbers, losing about 20 million followers. All other major religions — including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Hinduism — grew larger.\n\nJust as a marketing message, “Let’s fight for moderation!” is a difficult sales pitch, because it’s so contrary to human nature. It doesn’t turn heads or command our imagination. \n\nInstead, we’re excited by extremes: extreme beauty, extreme danger, extreme ideas. The more extreme, the better!\n\nModeration feels wishy-washy, weak, and noncommittal.\n\nAnd that’s why the extremists have already won the secret war raging within the Democratic Party. It didn’t receive much media attention, but after more moderate Democrats won gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey — while a left-of-Bernie-Sanders socialist won the mayor’s race in New York City — two warring sides were battling over the post-election narrative.\n\nIt was the moderates versus the extremists. Which model should the Democrats follow on a national level?\n\nHad the Democratic candidate stumbled in any of the gubernatorial races, the picture would be less murky. But sometimes, you can be a victim of your own success.\n\nYesterday afternoon, Politico described the Dems' dilemma thusly:\n\nBut the across-the board wins [in 2025] paper over an ideological divide that’s brewing in the party: Will young men be won back by moderation, or by Mamdani?\n\nModeration or Mamdani? You kiddin’ me?!\n\nIt’s a Tyson/McNeeley-sized mismatch: Moderation will lose in a landslide!\n\nCollege kids aren’t gonna get up early and march for moderation. It’s a poor call-to-action. Left-wing activists instinctively crave something more inspiring — more incendiary — and far more revolutionary.\n\nWhich is why the future of the Democratic Party belongs to the extremists.\n\nActually, the future is now. The two top Democratic Socialists in New York City, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, just declined to press their advantage against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) — but they're running the table everywhere else.\n\nYour challenge, dear reader, is to “reverse engineer” AOC and Mamdani’s tactics.\n\nFrom yesterday’s Washington Times: “More incumbent House Democrats hit with primary challenges from younger socialist candidates:”\n\nAt least nine prominent Democratic House incumbents are facing primary challenges in the midterms from opponents on their left flank who, in some cases, are much younger.Democratic Socialists have the wind at their backs following the elections earlier this month of New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and Seattle Mayor-elect Katie Wilson, and prominent House Democrats now find themselves the next target of these political upstarts.A handful of the Democrats being primaried are New York lawmakers, including Reps. Hakeem Jeffries, Dan Goldman, Grace Meng and Ritchie Torres.\n\nRep. Jeffries serves in New York City — right in the heart of the AOC/Mamdani socialist powerbase. If the Democratic Socialists REALLY wanted to prove their point, he’d probably be the most high-profile scalp they could realistically claim. With the Democratic Party mired in historically low approval ratings, an institutional, “corporate” Democrat like Jeffries would be especially vulnerable to a young, charismatic upstart.\n\nAll it would take is for AOC and Mamdani to throw their weight behind a Democratic Socialist challenger!\n\nBut they didn’t. And instead, they cut their own revolution off at the knees:\n\nMr. Jeffries received good news over the weekend when Mr. Mamdani and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the most well-known democratic socialists in New York, ran interference for Mr. Jeffries, the House minority leader, to help his re-election.Ms. Ocasio-Cortez recently told reporters she did not think it was a “good idea” for New York City Councilman Chi Ossé, a democratic socialist, to challenge Mr. Jeffries for the House seat in Brooklyn.Mr. Mamdani went as far as to urge his fellow members of the Democratic Socialists of America allies not to endorse Mr. Ossé over Mr. Jeffries last weekend, and Mr. Ossé ultimately did not receive the endorsement of the organization’s New York City chapter.Other New York Democratic incumbents have yet to receive the same high-profile support on the far left as Mr. Jeffries, who many believe is the likely choice to become speaker if the Democrats recapture the House.\n\nVery odd. Why do you suppose AOC and Mamdani pulled back? It was a race the Dem Socialists ABSOLUTELY could’ve won!\n\nThe most likely answer is, in closed-door discussions, Rep. Jeffries has already bent his knee and agreed to back the Democratic Socialists’ agenda if/when he becomes Speaker of the House.\n\nThere’s no point, after all, wasting resources over territory you already control.\n\nOtherwise, you’d expect a socialist revolutionary to support the socialist revolution. When AOC and Mamdani suddenly side in solidarity with the bourgeoisie, something is amiss… unless, of course, there’s more to the story.\n\nRecommended: Your Gobble-Gobble of the Day: Dem Senator Laments How ‘Dem Women Look Like Dem Men’\n\nPolitico thinks the Democratic Party is still debating which direction to go: Moderation or Mamdani?\n\nThey don’t realize the debate is over — and Mamdani’s side has already won.\n\nOne Last Thing: The Democrats are on the ropes, but make no mistake: The donkeys are still dangerous.

Mamdani publicly won over his fiercest critic, while Trump upended the narrative, knocked the Epstein files out of the news, and showed a shockingly charming side. It was all anyone could talk about afterward. \n\nWhen a reporter asked Mamdani about calling Trump a fascist, Mamdani started to dance around the question until Trump cut in with a genuinely funny, “You could just say yes.”\n\nBut that is old news. What isn’t is the quandary in which Trump has now put his own party. The GOP’s entire 2026 strategy was to “turn national Democratic candidates into Mamdani copycats,” according to Politico.\n\nHouse Republicans’ campaign arm had already launched digital ads across 49 battleground districts, casting Democrats as followers of the “socialist mayor” who “built his movement on defunding the police and abolishing ICE.” \n\nThe spot tried to fuse Mamdani to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries—who endorsed him late in the race—and warned ominously that “your city could be next.”\n\nSenate Republicans eagerly jumped on the bandwagon too, declaring that they would fight the “socialism [that] now controls the Democrat Party.” \n\nMeanwhile, GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York insisted, “I don’t think there’s any question he will be on the ballot next November. This is something that will certainly play in New York, but I think you’ll see it across the country.”\n\nAnd then there’s the star-crossed GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, who has been screwed over by Trump time and time again. Her entire uphill campaign for governor was built on claiming that current Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul was a puppet of “jihadist” Mamdani.\n\nNow all of those Republicans are left with egg on their face. They spent weeks painting Mamdani as the socialist boogeyman who would drag Democrats down with him, only for their own party leader to praise him. Those photos of Trump beaming beside Mamdani did more damage to the GOP narrative than any Democratic rebuttal ever could. \n\nTry to make Mamdani a campaign issue now—and they’ll still try, of course—and all Democrats have to do is point to Trump’s own words. The whole attack collapses under the weight of Trump’s grin.\n\nStefanik, for her part, put on a brave face. \n\n“I stand by my statement,” she told News 12. “He is a jihadist. This is an area where President Trump and I disagree.” \n\nShe was already going to lose next year—with or without Mamdani—running in one of the bluest states. But now she’s lost the entire premise of her campaign: tying Hochul to the “jihadist” mayor-elect. Even her defiance feels performative, as if she knows the script has changed and she’s stuck delivering lines from the wrong play.\n\nAnd for the rest of the GOP? It’s doubtful Republicans could have squeezed much mileage out of one mayor, no matter how big New York City is. Voters aren’t in the mood for culture-war theatrics when their rent keeps climbing and their grocery bills double. \n\nNow Republicans are sinking millions into the December special election in Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District—which Trump won 60% to 38% in 2024—because even in one of their strongest districts, they don’t feel safe after Mamdani’s win. That panic says far more about the GOP’s internal collapse than any fictional threat posed by New York City’s mayor.\n\nTheir entire strategy collapses under the simplest test: If the monster doesn’t scare people in Tennessee’s reddest district today, he’s not going to scare anyone in 2026.\n\nBut all of that is moot because Trump is now friends with Mamdani, proving once again that Trump doesn’t give a damn about his party—or really anything other than himself. The GOP spent months painting Mamdani as the face of socialist doom, and Trump casually torched the entire strategy in a single photo-op..\n\nThe meeting knocked Epstein off the airwaves for the weekend, and to Trump, that alone made the whole thing worthwhile—no matter how much political shrapnel his party will take in the months and years to come. \n\nAnd who knows, maybe Trump genuinely likes Mamdani. Maybe he enjoyed the meeting. Maybe he saw someone who wasn’t afraid of him and found that refreshing. And if that’s the case, then the GOP is in even deeper trouble.\n\nRepublicans can map out whatever 2026 strategy they want, but none of it matters if Trump wakes up one morning and decides he likes the guy they’ve spent months trying to turn into a national villain.",

Mamdani acknowledged that he did, while Trump relieved the tension by laughing it off.\n\nDuring the meeting, the two New Yorkers from the polar ends of the political spectrum discussed immigration, real estate and crime, zoning laws, and utility costs, and agreed on one issue that is one of the president’s passions: They both want to build more in New York City.

We agree on a lot more than I would’ve thought.”\n\nNew York’s next mayor has made housing the centerpiece of his political identity, promising to unleash the public sector to build affordable homes that the private market has failed to build. Affordable housing is a major problem all over the country, but especially in New York. A controversy over one garden spotlights a broader policy question—whether urban planners can deliver both housing and ecological health in an era of climate stress. Or will New York and other American cities continue to trade one public good for another?\n\nLike President Trump in his past as a real estate developer building glass skyscrapers, Mamdani is facing serious opposition to his desire to replace green space with residential housing. Consider his quest to construct public housing for elderly on the site of the Elizabeth Street Garden—a whimsical pocket of Manhattan filled with neoclassical statues, pear trees, and rosebushes. In one of his final official acts to block his path, on November 3, after Mayor Eric Adams had already stepped down as a candidate but one day before the election, he quietly designated the garden as parkland “permanently.” Now, Mamdani will need the approval of the State Legislature to construct housing on the site. Building housing for the unhoused was one of Mamdani’s campaign promises. When Adams’ decision came to light, Mamdani expressed his annoyance: “It is no surprise that Mayor Adams is using his final weeks to cement a legacy of dysfunction and inconsistency.” \n\nAdams countered that his decision was about “protecting his legacy.” Yet, in pursuing this cause, he is doing an about-face. Adams, too, once tried to bulldoze the garden to build housing for low-income seniors. He lost to a fierce coalition of neighborhood activists.\n\nIt’s easy to see both sides. The city’s affordable housing shortage has reached crisis proportions—more than 91,133 people sleep in the main New York City shelter system, and 25 percent of renters spend more than half their income on housing. Yet green space, too, has shifted from luxury to necessity. Trees and gardens cool the air, clean the lungs, and soothe the mind. Environmental justice advocates rightly insist that a healthy city requires both roofs and roots. But as real estate prices soar, New York’s leaders are pressed into what feels like an unforgiving binary—homes or habitats, people or plants.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be that way. There was a time when common green spaces were part of everyday urban life. In colonial New England, villagers foraged, grazed animals, and gathered wood on the green and in shared forests. Commons provided the material cornucopia that powered essential common law rights to food, fuel, and shelter. When commoners moved to cities, they brought these practices with them—transforming waste ground and food scraps into fertile soil for small gardens. Shared land served as the foundation for civic infrastructure that we hold dear today. Before it became a jewel of the elite in the 1850s, sections of Central Park were once a patchwork of green shantytowns, built by working people who grew food and raised animals on “wasteland.” The same was true of Hyde Park in London, Rock Creek Park in Washington, DC, and the Fenway in Boston. \n\nAs a historian, I look to the distant past, but you don’t have to go too far back in time to see the service of urban greenspace. In Washington in 1950, the US Department of Agriculture counted more than 2,000 hogs and 74,000 chickens, long after laws had banned both types of animals from the city. As late as the 1950s, in cities as different as New York, Washington, Cleveland, Detroit, and Memphis, large numbers of working people relied for subsistence on their backyard gardens and on food grown on roofs and balconies. Home-grown provisions saved people money to pay rents and mortgages. In 1940, some of the poorest neighborhoods of Washington, east of the Anacostia River, where 94 percent of the population was Black, had some of the highest rates of homeowner occupancy, second only to the high-income DuPont Circle neighborhood. The green lungs of our cities were born not of wealth, but of necessity.\n\nIn the decades that followed, regular people, not business or city leaders, held cities together during economic downturns. They cleaned up unregulated dumping and generally kept their neighborhoods from descending into a scene from Planet of the Apes. In the 1970s, as New York City teetered on the brink of bankruptcy, developers abandoned buildings, and landlords torched their properties for insurance money. New Yorkers stepped in to claim the ruins.\n\nBy 1990, neighbors in all five boroughs, but especially on the Lower East Side, the Bronx, and Brooklyn, turned vacant lots into an estimated 800 community gardens. (In the 2000s, Mayor Rudy Giuliani sought to auction off many of the garden lots, but protestors saved most of them.) In the same spirit, in 1991, Allan Reiver—a scavenger of forgotten art and architectural fragments—leased several lots on Elizabeth Street to save them from becoming a parking lot. He filled them with plants and sculpture, creating the lush, eccentric sanctuary that stands today.\n\nThe real question is not whether to preserve one garden, but how to reclaim the idea of the urban commons. For the last 100 years, New York City’s shared spaces have been shaped not by the people who live in them but by the infrastructures built to move them—or exclude them.\n\nIn the 1940s, Robert Moses, the “master builder” who never held elected office, remade the city for the automobile. His parkways to Long Island’s beaches, deliberately engineered with low overpasses, barred buses and thus working-class visitors. His web of expressways gutted neighborhoods from the Bronx to Red Hook in the name of progress, displacing hundreds of thousands of working poor to house the middle and upper classes. He famously declared that “a city without traffic is a ghost town.” Moses’ ghost lingers in the grid: nearly a quarter of New York’s land area is devoted to streets and parking lots. Each car registered in the city effectively enjoys one and a half parking spaces, while the city’s human residents scramble for housing. Streets and parking lots, devoted to moving and storing cars, are the commons of our age. \n\nBut the era of the city-as-parking-lot is ending. In 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency launched the “Green Streets Program,” encouraging communities to redesign streets with gardens, bioswales, bike paths, and permeable pavement, a green infrastructure that naturally manages stormwater, reduces pollution, and creates more resilient and healthier communities. Mamdani’s proposal for high-speed bus lanes, pedestrian walkways, and the transformation of parking lots into public housing promises to turn New York toward a viridescent horizon. As the city is reconfigured with fewer cars, New Yorkers could, as in the past, take it further, transforming the new wastes (pavement) into a blooming bounty. Curbside gardens could replace idling cars. Parking lots could be transformed into orchards and community plots. Major avenues could be reborn as edible forests of fruits, nuts, herbs, and flowers, as the famed “Gangsta Gardener” Ron Finley has been doing in South Central Los Angeles. “To change a community,” Finley says, “you have to change the soil.”\n\nCities in Europe are already showing what that might look like on a large scale. In the past two decades, the socialist mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, has replaced more than 50,000 parking spaces and hundreds of car lanes with parks, bike paths, and tree-lined promenades. The banks of the Seine, once choked with traffic, are now a riverfront park. And Parisians appeared to be fully supportive of the transformation. Earlier this year, they voted to ban cars from an additional 500 streets. Nitrogen dioxide levels that once sat in the red zone have fallen into the green.\n\nAmsterdam is doing the same. So is Copenhagen, where a devastating 2011 flood led engineers to rip up asphalt and replace it with wetlands, ponds, and rooftop gardens to absorb the next deluge. London, improbably, is reintroducing beavers to help manage stormwater—and in the process, Londoners are learning how to care for and live with beavers.\n\nThese European projects configure civic infrastructure differently. Climate infrastructure, equity infrastructure, and survival infrastructure are what students of urban planning study today. The impasse between the former and future mayor over the Elizabeth Street Gardens is a false conflict. Climate adaptation and social justice are not competing priorities. They are two sides of the same project—a new vision of the urban commons visible in Mr. Mamdani’s campaign plan to turn 500 asphalt school yards into 500 neighborhood green spaces. “When we stand up and say that we have an agenda to transform our city schools, to renovate 500 public schools, to build 500 green schoolyards, to create thousands of union jobs, to transform 50 schools into resilience hubs, and to prioritize those that have long been forgotten,” he told a Nation reporter, “that is an agenda we are willing to fight for. That is an agenda we are willing to defend.”\n\nKate Brown is the Distinguished Professor in the History of Science at M.I.T. and author of Tiny Gardens Everywhere: The Past, Present, and Future of the Self-Provisioning City, which will be published in February by Norton.",

Then came the news that she had died on Thanksgiving. \n\nBeckstrom was only 20 years old. She'd volunteered to work the day before Thanksgiving, so other members could be home with their families. \n\nIt was horrible news. And the other Guard member, Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, is still in critical condition, fighting for his life. \n\nPresident Donald Trump had previously condemned the attack. He announced Beckstrom's death, saying she was \"outstanding in every way.\" He also spoke with her family, who he said were \"devastated.\" \n\nREAD MORE: Heartbreak: Dad of National Guard Soldier Gives Devastating Update After Terror Attack\n\nTrump Announces That National Guard Member Sarah Beckstrom Has Passed Away After D.C. Terrorist Attack\n\nMany noticed that the X comment from Zohran Mamdani, the mayor-elect of New York City, in response to the news of Beckstrom's death, was seriously lacking in some fundamental things. \n\nI'm devastated to learn of the passing of Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, a member of the West Virginia National Guard. She was only twenty years old. As families across the nation come together today to celebrate Thanksgiving, let us take a moment to think of those in West Virginia who have been plunged into unimaginable grief.\n\nHe didn't mention anything about Beckstrom being killed or murdered. He didn't mention it was allegedly by an Afghan national who yelled, \"Allahu Akbar.\" He didn't mention that the police are alleging it was an ambush and are investigating it as possible terrorism. He didn't mention Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe. \n\nI also didn't see any other X comments from him condemning or even mentioning the attack. So it wasn't like he had already addressed the attack in another post, and that was a follow-up post. However, I did find a tweet asking for donations for his transition team, the day before Thanksgiving. \n\nHis tweet went viral because people noticed and were blasting him for what he left out. \n\nThat last comment was a slam regarding his controversial comment about what his \"aunt\" allegedly experienced after 9/11, saying she didn't feel safe to ride the subway in her hijab. It's a reference to how he missed the bigger picture with that remark and now this, with leaving out how Beckstrom was killed. \n\nREAD MORE: Zohran Mamdani 'Clarifies' Story About His Aunt With an Unbelievable Answer\n\nGood luck, New York City, you voted for this. \n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy RedState conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

He’s going to give Putin most of what he wants. His pursuit of his perceived political enemies is going to be massively unpopular and drive his numbers down into the mid-30s before too long if he keeps it up. And all these incompetent and corrupt henchpeople aren’t helping. The movement is collapsing.\n\nAnd this will embolden both Trump’s opponents and those he’s had in his gunsights. Seven months ago, law firms and universities were terrified of Trump. I bet not so much now. It’s been so inspiring and important to see citizens in Chicago and Evanston and so many other places rise up to oppose Trump and his masked agents in their roundups. It was gratifying to see Zohran Mamdani run circles around him, and Trump’s passive demeanor that day was telling. Even the Beltway Democrats, or some of them anyway, are showing some game.\n\nPeople may not hate incompetence. They may not hate corruption. And they may not hate extremism. But all three at once?

        "text": "In the run-up to New York’s mayoral election, many business leaders described Zohran Mamdani as a catastrophe in the making. Corporate and Wall Street titans dumped $40 million into political action committees to try to prevent the young democratic socialist from winning, saying his proposals on crime and taxes would make New York less safe and companies unable to compete.\n\nSince Mr. Mamdani’s resounding victory on Nov. 4, however, the business community has adopted a far more conciliatory tone. Though some are still predicting a rough road ahead or even threatening to flee the city, others have been extending olive branches and saying they want to try to work with the incoming mayor. JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon called Mr. Mamdani to offer his assistance. Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who had tried without success to recruit candidates to run against Mr. Mamdani, congratulated him on social media.\n\n“Some have been surprised by my conciliatory post,” tweeted Mr. Ackman, who has decried Mr. Mamdani’s criticism of Israel. “Mamdani won a decisive election. He is going to be our mayor for the next four years.”\n\nThe outreach is running in both directions. Since winning the Democratic primary in June, Mr. Mamdani has been quietly meeting with city stakeholders to get buy-in for his affordability agenda and to listen to their concerns. His charm offensive even included a recent high-profile trip to the White House, during which he and President Donald Trump held a friendly news conference after a private meeting in which they reportedly discussed New York real estate and utilities.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s early administrative appointments – including Dean Fuleihan as first deputy mayor, a position he held under former Mayor Bill de Blasio, and NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch, who will stay on in her current role – have reassured skeptics that he intends to fill City Hall with experienced hands. He has requested resignations from 179 Adams administration employees.\n\nStill, many are in wait-and-see mode. By early next year, many of New York’s well-connected and influential business leaders could find themselves in the unusual position of being on the outside of the new mayor’s inner circle.\n\n“The real estate industry is going to be very predictable. They’re going to work with him on stuff, and if there’s stuff they don’t like, they’ll fight it. They’re going to be engaged. The question is, what is the larger business community going to do?” says Jordan Barowitz, principal at Barowitz Advisory and a former aide to former Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\n“Do they seek to have a voice in the granular operations? Or do they just go back to picking and choosing when they want to get involved?”\n\nA coming fight over taxes\n\nMr. Mamdani’s biggest challenge might be navigating Wall Street’s resistance to his stated priorities on taxes and spending.\n\nHe campaigned on raising New York’s corporate tax rate from 7.25% to 11.5% and increasing taxes by two percentage points on New Yorkers making more than $1 million. Those tax hikes – decried almost unanimously by New York’s banking and corporate sectors – are meant to pay for expensive campaign promises such as a universal child-care program, free bus transit, and a public grocery store pilot.\n\nNew York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and state lawmakers, who set tax rates, are reportedly mulling over Mr. Mamdani’s proposals. Some lobbyists caution that the burden of funding the incoming mayor’s ambitious agenda will depress the city’s economy, making businesses less competitive in a way that ultimately hurts all New Yorkers.\n\n“We see increased taxes as only contributing to a further affordability crisis,” said Kathryn Wylde, chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, which represents the city’s corporate leaders. “The goal, as far as we’re concerned, is to reduce costs, so we don’t have to constantly increase government spending.”\n\nSo far, that kind of pushback from corporate influencers hasn’t deterred Mr. Mamdani, who has also promised to identify and weed out government inefficiencies by hiring more auditors, streamlining contracts, and issuing more fines.\n\nBut in this fast-paced, sometimes ruthless city, it’s another Mr. Mamdani priority that could generate even more pushback from executives.\n\nLina Khan, who chaired the Federal Trade Commission under former President Joe Biden, has joined Mr. Mamdani’s transition team with specific instructions to explore ways to utilize local laws to crack down on predatory business practices. Some measures will require cooperation with the city council or state legislature. But Ms. Khan says the mayor has standalone power to sue “corporate lawbreakers” for things like price gouging through city agencies such as the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection.\n\nSome conservatives aren’t waiting for Mr. Mamdani’s inauguration to hold the mayor-elect to account.\n\nRecently, supermarket magnate John Catsimatidis, a longtime Trump supporter, convened a roundtable of business leaders and politicians on what was initially billed as a “watchdog group” to monitor the incoming Mamdani administration on public safety and other issues. Mr. Catsimatidis later insisted he actually wanted to work with the new mayor and try to find common ground.\n\n“The one thing that we all hold in common is that we all love New York … and we want New York to thrive like it always has,” Mr. Catsimatidis said at a news conference.\n\n“The real estate community is stuck”\n\nCity real estate owners might be more familiar with Mr. Mamdani than Wall Street executives, but that doesn’t mean they will get along with him any better.\n\nOne of Mr. Mamdani’s most prominent campaign pledges was to freeze rent increases for the city’s 1 million regulated apartments by appointing sympathetic members to the city’s rent guidelines board. Over the past four years, the board has approved a cumulative 12.6% rent hike cap for these homes since Mayor Eric Adams took office, or about 3% per year on one-year leases.\n\nMr. Mamdani’s move would halt that trend, worrying landlords who say they need the rental income to maintain their properties, given that insurance, real estate taxes, and utility expenses continue to rise.\n\n“There is a myth that rent-stabilized housing is financially healthy. The reality is that one-third of the buildings are in fiscal distress and basically bankrupt, and another third will be bankrupt after four years of rent freezes,” said Kenny Burgos, head of the New York Apartment Association.\n\nThe mayor-elect’s plans to build new housing have been better received. Mr. Mamdani has proposed spending $100 billion in public funds to build 200,000 subsidized homes across the city’s five boroughs over the next decade, essentially tripling the annual production of affordable housing.\n\nIf Mr. Mamdani can actually accomplish this goal, he’ll become the “most pro-housing mayor that has ever existed in New York,” says David Schwartz, co-founder of Slate Property Group. “It’s exciting that we have a mayor who wants to produce tremendous amounts of affordable housing.”\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Mamdani has continued meeting with prominent commercial real estate owners to make his pitch and to listen to their views.\n\nHe has previously acknowledged the role the private sector plays in addressing the city’s housing shortage and said he would adopt a Bloomberg-like managerial style at City Hall. But skepticism remains over his approach to development and tax reform.\n\n“The real estate community is stuck. They are amenable because they have to be,” says Ms. Wylde of the Partnership for New York City. “The mayor has much more power over real estate than over any other industry.”\n\nAllies in the tech industry\n\nSome suggest Mr. Mamdani’s strongest alliances in the private sector might be with the city’s growing tech industry.\n\nEmployees of Google, Meta, and Amazon were among the largest groups of donors to Mr. Mamdani’s mayoral campaign this year, signifying broad support for his agenda among the city’s young professional class.\n\nJulie Samuels, president and CEO of Tech:NYC, which represents the city’s tech industry, believes their embrace of the incoming mayor is based on cultural affinity.\n\n“A lot about Zohran’s campaigns felt disruptive, and that resonated a lot with tech,” she says. “Part of it is an age thing, too. You’re going to have all these digital natives in City Hall, and that’s a good thing.”\n\nAt roundtable discussions hosted by Tech:NYC, participants have pressed Mr. Mamdani’s team to integrate technology, including artificial intelligence-powered programs, to improve the delivery of city services and expedite permit processing. Mayor-elect Mamdani did not make AI a focus of his campaign, though he warned about its potential to eliminate jobs.\n\n“The tech sector feels more like the genie is not going back in the bottle, and we would all be better served to figure out policy answers,” particularly when it comes to AI, says Ms. Samuels. “The answer is to not put their head in the sand and say the tech is not going to come here.”\n\nStill, highly regulated start-ups could find themselves in the mayor’s crosshairs anyway. The incoming Mamdani administration will face pressure from Airbnb to loosen restrictions preventing single-family homeowners from listing their properties on the platform for less than 30 days, which the city began enforcing two years ago.\n\nThe home-sharing company’s super PAC spent $1 million on a digital ad attacking Mr. Mamdani and two other mayoral candidates who did not support changes to the law.\n\nAnd DoorDash dumped $1 million into a super PAC objecting to Mr. Mamdani’s call to raise the minimum wage to $30, classify delivery workers as employees, and strengthen licensure requirements for delivery apps.\n\nChris Coffey, chief executive of Tusk Strategies, who has created media campaigns for both Uber and Bird, expects DoorDash to try to make peace to get what it wants in City Hall – at least initially.\n\n“I don’t see them meaningfully fighting the mayor now that he’s been elected,” he says. “They’re going to try to work with him and see what happens.”",

        "text": "In the aftermath of Zohran Mamdani’s electoral victory earlier this month, it became clear that socialism is a greater threat on the left than ever before. It is also clear that the GOP could no longer coast along by proclaiming, “Vote for us because he’s a socialist,” assuming that people would forever have a knee-jerk reaction to that word.\n\nOne issue that defined New York’s mayoral race — and increasingly politics throughout the country — is affordability. For millions of Americans, affording rent, groceries, health care, and a home seem further out of reach than ever before. The issue has been winked at by politicians across the spectrum for years around election time with precious little results to show for it.\n\nExplaining to voters why they are wrong — or even worse, outright dismissing their concerns — has never worked politically, and that is not going to change now. \n\nWe have largely reached a point where this can no longer be avoided: We are now seeing regular releases of ever-worsening economic figures. The median age for all U.S. home buyers is 59 — a staggering statistic by itself, made even worse by the fact that it is up from just 28 back in 1991.\n\nAnd it is not just that people are getting priced out of home ownership — rents have gone up astronomically over the past decade, leading us to a situation in which the American consumer is clearly struggling to get by. From credit card debt at record highs with seriously delinquent accounts hitting 12%, the highest since 2012, to auto repos matching 2009 levels, it is pretty clear that the consumer is maxed out.\n\nLooking around at how conservative pundits spent the last few weeks talking though, you would not know it at all. You would be forgiven if you thought they had just come off a huge electoral victory. Conservatism simply cannot reduce itself to being the worst caricature of cold elitism that turns a blind eye to the very real economic struggles many in the country are facing.\n\nBen Shapiro kicked things off after suggesting to young people that they simply should not live in places like New York City, criticizing the idea that someone would deserve to live where they grew up and where job opportunities are heavily concentrated.\n\nThat same week, Donald Trump opened a rift within his own base — a rare sight for sure — in an interview with Laura Ingraham over the issue of H-1B visas. When she pushed him on his stance, saying that we have “plenty of talented people here,” he interrupted with, “No you don’t, no you don’t.” Instead of focusing on how to make American workers more competitive through better education or training, the message heard by many was that Americans were not up for the job.\n\nWorst of all may have been Dinesh D’Souza, who felt the need to weigh in on Vivek Ramaswamy’s meritocratic education reform by essentially race-baiting, saying: “How ironic it will be if a brown American like Vivek actually helps to fix education and raise the prospects of white kids, while all the professional whiteys on X continue their idle boasting.” Whatever the merits of education reform, mocking struggling Americans — especially through whatever “professional whiteys” is supposed to mean — is not doing anyone any favors.\n\nWith approaches like these from the right, who needs the left anymore? It took Ramaswamy’s opponent in the Ohio gubernatorial race, Amy Acton, all of 24 hours to put together an ad saying that Ramaswamy thinks “Ohioans are lazy and mediocre. He’s wrong.” It practically wrote itself.\n\nArguments like these from conservatives do more damage to the defense of capitalism than attacks from socialists ever could and are totally disconnected from what free markets actually are. Capitalism has delivered more prosperity than any system in human history, and it is not even close — but it did not get there by running on the platform of saying, “You’re too poor to live where you grew up, our country isn’t talented, move aside.”\n\nNew York City is famous throughout the world because it is the city where generation after generation of people who wanted to work hard could go and make something of themselves. Nobody I have seen on the right is asking for a luxury life handed to them on a silver spoon while they sit on the couch. They are frustrated by the fact that the world seems to be increasingly out of reach for them.\n\nThe only person in the GOP who seems to be able to see this, I’m horrified to say, appears to be Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), who spent the last few weeks getting attacked for acknowledging that many “young adults are barely making it” and accusing Trump’s allies of gaslighting Americans about the cost of living. On Saturday, she posted on X: “My heart is with Americans who struggle to afford life in America today.”\n\nTo her credit, she has been consistent in prioritizing cost-of-living issues — something that has become far too rare in the GOP since Donald Trump took office. She has taken the lead in warning that health insurance premiums would double for millions of Americans — including her own adult children — when enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies expire, while Republican leadership has largely sidestepped the problem.\n\nRELATED: Mamdani sells socialism — and Republicans peddle the Temu version\n\n Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\nWe on the right have long embraced a tougher-love approach that certainly includes prioritizing a strong work ethic, and nobody needs to give that up. But that is not the issue here at all — Ben Shapiro’s comments are not directed at people who do not want to work; they are directed at and felt by those who do work and still cannot afford many basic things that previous generations took for granted.\n\nExplaining to voters why they are wrong — or even worse, outright dismissing their concerns — has never worked politically, and that is not going to change now. Support for capitalism has now fallen to 54% overall, with Democrats preferring socialism 66% to 42%.\n\nPeter Thiel’s now-viral email from 2020 captures exactly what is underlying this shift: \n\nFrom the perspective of a broken generational compact ... when one has too much student debt or if housing is too unaffordable, then one will have negative capital for a long time ... if one has no stake in the capitalist system, then one may well turn against it. \n\nHe was right then, and he is right now. The only thing left to be seen is whether the right will wake up to that reality before it is too late.\n\nIf this month’s performance is any indication, I am not holding my breath.\n\nEditor’s note: This article was originally published by RealClearPolitics and made available via RealClearWire.",

        "text": "A new report argues the sanitation department isn’t going far enough in its effort to containerize all the city’s trash, noting the plan pushed under Mayor Eric Adams doesn’t cover the heaps of recycling that are still allowed to pile up on sidewalks.\n\nThe report, which the Center for Building in North America and the Center for Zero Waste Design published on Friday, gives city officials credit for mandating all the city’s businesses and small residential buildings put out their garbage in secured bins. But it also points out that paper, plastic and glass recycling continues to clutter up walkways.\n\nThe group wants the city to eventually require recyclables as well as compost to be put out in the city’s new “Empire Bins,” which are slowly being rolled out in parking spaces to store trash from large buildings.\n\nClare Miflin, executive director of the Center for Zero Waste Design, said the city was too narrowly focused on removing garbage bags from sidewalks and failed to take recycling into account.\n\n“When you're going to do something this big and expensive, I think you need to think bigger,” she said, laying out a vision where the vast majority of the city’s waste and recycling is stored in bins sitting atop parking spaces. “ We think that it shouldn't be trash only. It should be for both recycling streams and compostable waste. All of them should be alongside each other in the street.”\n\nThe sanitation department plans to install those streetside bins in front of every residential building with more than 30 units over the next seven years. Owners of buildings with 10 to 30 units can either request for one of the bins to be installed or rely on wheelie bins that are set out for collection. Landlords with fewer than 10 units are already required to put out their trash in the smaller containers.\n\nSanitation department spokesperson Joshua Goodman said the city’s approach balances what is possible on narrow streets with the goal of getting trash off sidewalks, and once-weekly mountains of recycling don’t attract rats in the same way as garbage bags, which get collected more frequently.\n\n“For a long time, people either said containerization in New York City would be incredibly easy or they said it would be entirely impossible. Both of those groups were wrong,” he said. “It is achievable, as we are showing, and it is difficult and requires trade-offs, as we are also showing.”\n\nAdding compost and recycling to the Empire Bins has precedent. The ones installed outside of school buildings in parts of Brooklyn and Upper Manhattan over the last two years as part of a pilot program have separate receptacles for organic waste and recyclables. Sanitation officials have said schools require that option because they produce far more compostable waste than residential buildings.\n\nZero Waste Design has long butted heads with the sanitation department’s trash containerization plan, arguing it’s not ambitious enough. The group could find some purchase for their ideas when Zohran Mamdani takes office. Miflin is part of the 400-person team working on Mamdani’s mayoral transition. The mayor-elect has said he also supports containerizing the city’s recycling.",

        "text": "Plenty of policy differences, too, within the party, most notably Reagan-Bush internationalism vs. America First, with whatever ruction is to come over a possible Ukraine deal. Speaking of policy, the Heritage Foundation…\n\nHealthy debate is fine, and yet what’s unnerving has been the surfacing of the “N” word — Nazi. Laura Loomer, who has fought her share of feuds, says the GOP has a “Nazi problem.” She’s talking about podcast provocateur Nick Fuentes, who has said, for instance, “Hitler was a pedophile and sort of a pagan. Well, he was also really f___ing cool.” \n\nIn the meantime, the Main Stream Media, still a force, stands ready to wedge wider Republican divides. The New York Times, the most forceful of the MSM, seems happy portraying Fuentes, who holds no elective office, into a GOP star, running 11 stories on him in the last month. The Times’ effort even includes a photo of Fuentes that vaults him up into Luigi Mangione-levels of anti-hero hunk.\n\nYet before we overdetermine the right-wing crack-up, we might step back and recall the many fissile moments of the last century. \n\nIn the 1910s and 20s, the Republican Party was split between regulars and progressives. In fact, twice, in 1912 and 1924, renegade Republicans launched major third-party campaigns against an incumbent GOP president. \n\nDuring the 1930s, the party was split between isolationists and interventionists. That split carried on after World War Two, in the form of Joe McCarthy vs. the establishment, and then, relatedly, Robert Taft vs. Dwight Eisenhower. \n\nIn the 1960s and 70s, Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan were two more Republican rams against establishmentarianism. In the 90s came the rebellions of four more right-of-center figures, David Duke, Ross Perot, Pat Buchanan, and Newt Gingrich. During the Iraq and Afghanistan 00s came a new surge in anti-interventionist thinking, typified by Ron and Rand Paul. In the 10s and now 20s, Donald Trump. \n\nWe can step back and see: The conservative movement and/or the GOP has been fissioned, bigly, a half-dozen times. Yet in each instance, it managed to fuse itself back together. To be sure, the movement and the party have changed; New England, once rock-ribbed Republican, albeit not all that conservative, is now Democratic and progressive, whereas most of the South is now MAGA. \n\nSome will assert of course, that the situation is worse today, that insurgent figures such as Fuentes are worse than past Republican insurgents. And that might prove true. We can’t know the future, even as we consider the possibility that Fuentes may prove to be nothing more than just a loudmouth. We should keep in mind that over the last century, some on the right have lionized such mephitic figures as Hitler and Mussolini when they were actually alive and evildoing. If we’re thoughtful enough to be interested in Republican Party history, we should be smart enough to avoid presentism, the narcissistic feeling that one’s own time is unique. \n\nSo perhaps the story of Republican fusionism, with all its evolutions, remains compelling — even if the would-be splitters on the left, eager to divide the right, show no interest in the possibility of conservative renewal. Fortunately, conservatives have one of their own, Daniel J. Flynn, to provide them with some usable, fusible history, The Man Who Invented Conservatism: The Unlikely Life of Frank S. Meyer.\n\nThe term “invented” in the title may understandably give readers pause; after all, neither Aristotle, Aquinas, nor Burke would recognize Meyer as the originator of conservatism. Even so, Flynn makes a compelling case that Meyer played a pivotal role in forging the right’s intellectual and partisan fusion in the 20th century.\n\nBorn to affluence in 1909, young man Meyer drifted through different dalliances, including a poetic fling with John Milton’s Satan. During those years, the epicurean but cerebral Meyer wafted through Princeton, Oxford, the London School of Economics, and the University of Chicago. \n\nMeanwhile, the Depression struck, and Meyer, like many intellectuals, gave his heart to communism. Here, Flynn, a veteran scribe for The American Spectator and author of six previous books, cuts in with incisive editorializing: “Even the alphabet hints at the short distance between Satan and Stalin.” \n\nIn the 1930s and early 40s, Meyer was a good communist, but not a great communist. Loyally joining the U.S. Army in World War II, he washed out for health reasons, and yet along the way, he noticed that his fellow GIs were Americans hoping for a nice life, not proletarians yearning for Bolshevism. \n\nMeyer’s sneaking suspicion that the red god had failed titrated in 1944, when he read Friedrich Hayek’s The Road to Serfdom. Flynn inserts the sly point that Hayek was his own kind of fusionist: “Hayek’s less doctrinaire brand of Austrian economics, pragmatically tolerating the existence of some aspects of the welfare state . . . made past poison potable.”\n\nMeyer’s review, appearing in New Masses, proved that he was, by now, a bad communist. The magazine reviewer found himself agreeing with the book author that “government economic planning demands the accumulation of immense power in central organs.” That was scary to Meyer, and he said so—and that was his last writing as a red. \n\nYet actually exiting the communist party was not risk-free. Meyer was well aware, for instance, of the 1937 assassination of Juliet Poyntz by Stalinist agents. Flynn, who knows this territory, cites historians John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, who found that the number of murders within the U.S. committed by Stalin’s henchmen to be “at least five hundred and probably more than a thousand.”\n\nStill, by 1947, Meyer was willing to cooperate with the FBI and congressional investigators as they commenced the long-overdue process of sweeping reds out from under beds. \n\nThe following year, Meyer read Richard Weaver’s Ideas Have Consequences. Flynn writes that the book had such a “profound influence on him that he later called it the fons et origo of the conservative movement.”\n\nBy now, Meyer was fully fused into conservatism and Republicanism. Yet he maintained some of his comradely thinking, including on the value of a “popular front.” That is, the broadest possible support consistent with the party line. \n\nSuch coalitionism was seen in Meyer’s 1953 review of Russell Kirk’s The Conservative Mind. To Meyer, the tome was a “repudiation of the American fusion of individualism and conservatism.” \n\nThere’s the “f” word, fusion, soon to be rendered as fusionism. As Flynn tells it, Meyer feared that “Kirk’s conception of conservatism… banished libertarians to the ideologue camp along with Marxists.” If so, then a matter of electoral mathematics, the cause of the right (setting aside Kirk’s view that libertarians weren’t conservative) would be diminished. \n\nFusionism is often described as a three-legged stool, the legs being economic, social, and foreign policy, and yet Meyer’s conception was both less complicated and more profound. Pointing to American history, he urged finding “virtue in freedom.” This twinning of personal liberty and self-discipline, writ large across politics, is Meyer’s enduring claim to political relevance, if not quite personal renown. \n\nMeyer developed his theme further in a 1962 volume, In Defense of Freedom: A Conservative Credo. Flynn writes: “The underlying idea that the American Founding’s significance involved advancing freedom and that American conservatives necessarily find freedom as their nation’s tradition attracted conservatives because of its simplicity and truth.” \n\nAnd while Meyer’s book is not widely known, it reaches deep. Flynn is correct when he avers, “One grasps the most compelling proof of the book’s influence by listening to conservatives who have never read it nevertheless recapitulate its themes.” \n\nIn 1955, Meyer caught on with a startup, National Review. To be sure, other conservative publications had existed, and yet NR had mojo: It had Bill Buckley. He was possessed of money and class, of course, and yet he also had fusionist skill, the ability to think of the magazine as a place where smart people could come together as a team, albeit a team of rivals. \n\nFlynn captures the teapot-tempests in a dense paragraph recalling intra-magazine maneuvering: \n\nKendall’s quarrels threatened to implode the burgeoning anti-Burnham coalition. With Kendall and Bozell, Meyer enjoyed a solid bloc capable of blocking the magazine from embracing Burnhamite positions. Unlike Schlamm, Kendall remained on the masthead as a senior editor. But he hung on tenuously. For reasons including friendship with Buckley and the alliance he forged to thwart Burnham, Meyer labored to keep Kendall within the magazine. Kendall, for his part, worked equally hard to give Buckley reasons to fire him.\n\nYet Meyer kept focused on fusion. In 1958, he wrote to Buckley: “If the Republican Party cannot get some grip of the actual world we live in and from it generalize and actively promote a program that means something to the masses of people, why, somebody else will.” \n\nThese political goals were soon to be tested, as conservatives confronted the John Birch Society, an anti-communist organization that took a good thing too far. Actually, way too far, as when its founder, Robert Welch, accused President Eisenhower of being a “dedicated, conscious agent of the communist conspiracy.” We can observe: Anti-communism = good. Proto-QAnon, masquerading as anti-communism = bad. \n\nMeyer wrote a memo to Buckley and others in 1961. Flynn’s book is enormously strengthened by a heretofore undiscovered cache of Meyer’s personal papers in an Altoona, PA warehouse, assessing that if the magazine wished to be the “conscience of American conservatism,” it confronted “a responsibility both morally and politically to which we have to face up.” \n\nAs a practical political matter, such facing up meant anathematizing Birch leadership without antagonizing the mass of Birchers who were, after all, voters. \n\nIn Flynn’s telling, NR handled this matter well, marginalizing Welch while retaining the Bircher base. Unsurprisingly, there’s scholarship from the left that takes a different view, and yet that just makes the topic all the meatier, worthy of further study. In any case, the John Birch Society still exists today, and yet over the last six decades, the Republican Party has done fine. \n\nMeyer died in 1972 at the relatively young age of 62. He was a chain smoker. Flynn piles on the posthumous credit: “In the 1940s, Frank Meyer changed his mind. By the end of the 1980s, he had changed the world.”\n\nAll true, and yet today, ghosts from the past are rising: We can see. \n\nParallels between the Birchers of six decades ago — and other even scarier types, and Fuentes’ “Groypers” of today. \n\nTo be sure, it’s possible that the Groypers will prove to be an illusion — a fad, a bunch of kids doing LOL. Yet even so, for Republicans, they are already at least something of a political millstone. Fuentes & Co. are, after all, the object of copious opposition research that Democrats are eager to amplify. \n\nWorking from such material, the left-wing agenda-setting Guardian declared on November 20, “Fuentes has ascended in recent weeks from the influential but unacknowledged outer dark of the American right to a position within striking distance of the mainstream Republican party.” Most Republicans might not think this is true, and yet if the MSM is reporting it as true, then the right must make an extra effort to rebut. \n\nIn the meantime, there’s at least some evidence that harm has been done. Pointing to exit poll data from the recent GOP defeats in the 2025 elections, longtime conservative operative Diana Banister puts it bluntly in the Examiner: “Republicans must reject the cult of creeps.” Yes, there’s the pseudo-fusionist concept of “no enemies on the right,” but even if one leaves aside morality, there’s practicality; if they repel more votes than they attract, they’re a bad deal. \n\nSo today’s effective fusionists, operating mindfully of Meyer, should shun Fuentes and speak instead to his followers, encouraging them to pursue, instead, a more civil and constructive path, which is also the way to win elections. \n\nOf course, the unifying right will soon have help from outside its camp. In New York City, Zohran Mamdani is about to take power. Mamdani calls himself a socialist, but surely Meyer would cut to the chase, and tag him as a communist. As they say, it takes one to know one. \n\nIn the meantime, as he moves around, seeking the most attention, Fuentes himself could finally do the Republicans a favor — by becoming a Democrat. He said recently, “The left has to give up immigration, the right has to give up on the free market.”\n\nSo here’s a suggestion to the GOP: Do not give up on the free market, hoping that a rebuffed Fuentes migrates over to Mamdanism. History tells us that many right-wing nuts have become left-wing nuts; the horseshoe and red-brown alliance have been real. \n\nNone of this is especially edifying for anyone who cares about decency or civility in American life. But fusionists would argue that their mission isn’t to perfect individuals, it’s to build coalitions, win elections, and advance a cause. That means keeping the right’s own house in order without indulging in endless self-flagellation over fringe figures. At the same time, Meyer-style fusionists would keep their focus on resisting the many tentacles of the left, regardless of whether the “hate-beat” reporters at the New York Times or other mainstream outlets bother to notice. The right has developed its own mediating institutions. It’s time to let them flex.\n\nMeyer has been gone for more than a half-century and yet his wisdom still has wings: If conservatives want to win, they must unite their coalition around the common causes of liberty and decency. \n\nJames P.

        "text": "A city-backed grocery store is serving up an answer to food insecurity in downtown Atlanta and should be emulated nationally, Mayor Andre Dickens told Newsweek.\n\nDickens envisions Azalea Fresh Market at 25 Peachtree Street as a transformative community hub rather than a place to simply pick up fresh food at affordable prices. Nearly three months after the launch of Atlanta’s first municipal grocery store, the recently reelected mayor says the public-private collaborative effort is flourishing and ought to inspire imitators throughout the country.\n\n“This is something that’s kind of personal,” Dickens told Newsweek during an interview on Wednesday. “When you start to see areas of your city have food deserts, where you can’t get fresh groceries without traveling quite a distance, it becomes disturbing, it becomes unsettling.”\n\nAzalea Fresh Market, Atlanta’s first city-run grocery store, served more than 700 customers during its first day in early September, city officials said. \n\nDickens, a 51-year-old Democrat and former city councilmember, tried to bridge that gap by attracting major grocery chains into downtown Atlanta, as well as some south and west sections, where largely “black and brown communities” long struggled to get quality and affordable fare, he said.\n\n“And they all eat, we all eat every day — but in order to get access to fresh food, you had to travel too far,” Dickens said. “So, the idea was, how do we make that right?”\n\nNational grocery chains balked at filling the void due to a lack of disposable income among would-be customers, coupled with the inclination to launch megastores with massive parking lots, Dickens said.\n\n“They were giving us their rationale,” he said. “And I was like, ‘So, what’s the solution?’ And they didn’t have one, and I was just disappointed in that.”\n\nAtlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, who was reelected to a second term earlier this month, believes city-run grocery stores can serve as community hubs. (Joshua Spruiel/City of Atlanta)\n\nDickens said Atlanta ultimately decided to “do it ourselves” by offering a slew of cash, grants and loans totaling $8 million for two Azalea Fresh Market locations, the first of which opened on September 8 in the city’s Olympia Building and replaced a former Walgreens. The second store is set to open in southwest Atlanta in February.\n\nDickens praised the city’s partners, including the Independent Grocers Alliance and Savi Provisions, for helping to meet the needs of roughly 14 percent of Atlantans who experience food insecurity.\n\n“We went and called them and they taught us,” Dickens said of IGA. “Remember, we run government, we don’t run grocery stores, but we know that people got to eat.”\n\nMore than 700 customers visited the Peachtree Street location on its first day of operation, generating several hundred thousand dollars in revenue. Roughly 5,500 customers are expected monthly, creating an estimated total economic impact of more than $6 million annually, city officials said.\n\nAzalea Fresh Market at 25 Peachtree Street provides much-needed options for downtown Atlanta residents, Dickens said. (Joshua Spruiel/City of Atlanta)\n\nSavi Provisions, which owns and operates Azalea Fresh Market along with 24 other specialty supermarkets across Georgia and North Carolina, said the alliance reinforces the company’s commitment to Atlanta.\n\n“We look forward to growing the Azalea Fresh Market brand and working together with stakeholders across the city to make this a truly accessible and homegrown concept,” Savi’s founder and CEO, Paul Nair, said in a statement in early September.\n\nAtlanta joins a growing number of cities experimenting with the public-private grocery store model. Zohran Mamdani, mayor-elect of New York City, championed municipal-owned markets during his campaign, vowing to open a network of locations exempt from paying rent or property taxes.\n\n“Without having to pay rent or property taxes, they will reduce overhead and pass on savings to shoppers,” Mamdani’s campaign website reads. “They will buy and sell at wholesale prices, centralize warehousing and distribution, and partner with local neighborhoods on products and sourcing.”\n\nAzalea Fresh Market offers a wide selection of local produce, meats, cheeses, beverages and other household staples. (Joshua Spruiel/City of Atlanta)\n\nReps for Mamdani, who takes office in January, praised the early success of Azalea Fresh Market.\n\n“As grocery prices climb, too many New Yorkers are struggling to feed their families — with more than 40% unable to afford the cost of groceries each week,” Mamdani spokesperson Dora Pekec told Newsweek in a statement. “With food insecurity rising across the country, Mayor-elect Mamdan...",

        "text": "“Naked Gun” and its two lesser sequels are filled to bursting with this kind of nonsense—connected to reality, by a thread, thanks to the actors’ unwavering deadpan delivery. It’s a kind of comedy that has mostly fallen out of favor—twelve-year-olds are more sophisticated these days, maybe—and it’s especially hard to pull off in our post-irony age. So I was skeptical enough of this year’s “Naked Gun” reboot, starring Liam Neeson as Frank Drebin, Jr., and Pamela Anderson as his romantic foil, to mostly forget that it was coming out. But then word got around: it was really funny. And, indeed, upon watching it, I agreed that the movie largely worked—the clunkers clunked hard, but, when the jokes and gags landed, I was hooting.\nMidway through, in a seduction scene that pays homage to the original, Anderson’s character looks out a window in Drebin’s apartment, admiring the lights of Los Angeles. “It’s quite a view you have,” she says. “You know, I’ve been drawn to the hills ever since I moved here for college.” “U.C.L.A.?” Drebin asks. “I see it every day,” she responds. “I live here.” Ah, that’s the stuff, dusted off and resurrected from some eighties comedy tomb. There were surely better jokes this year, but nothing made me laugh harder.\nSo, 2025. Good year? No, the worst. Still, there were some things that helped us smile through it.\nColdplaygate\nThe year’s most astonishing, unplanned visual gag involved a married (but not to each other) pair of tech executives caught embracing on a Kiss Cam at a Coldplay concert. “Either they’re having an affair, or they’re just very shy,” the band’s front man, Chris Martin, narrated in real time. The comedy seemed, at first, to be about just two people. But, upon rewatch (and then dozens more after that), it’s clear that this little vignette actually features a cast of three. First, there’s the woman encircled in the hug, registering a million awful things in the milliseconds before she turns away from the camera, her face in her hands. Then there’s the man doing the hugging, who, slower on the uptake, ducks out of view. O.K., fine, the world is now well acquainted with these poor souls, the subjects of countless late-night jokes, a Gwyneth Paltrow ad campaign, re-creations at stadiums around the world, and even Halloween costumes. But don’t miss the final beat, when the camera pans left and captures a third character, a woman registering the scene she’s just witnessed before becoming a part of it—her hand on the side of her head, grinning madly.\nThis Is Your Mother Calling\nThe comedian Emily Catalano told a perfect joke in 2024, but it made the rounds this year: “My mom called me today at 3 P.M., and the first thing she said to me was, ‘Did I wake you?’ Have you ever gotten a metaphorical and literal wake-up call at the exact same time?”\nThe Wi-Fi Is Down\nThe winner of this year’s prize for Humorless Tech Billionaire Forced to Endure Technical Difficulties During His Own Tech Presentation goes to Mark Zuckerberg. In September, donning a dopey pair of smart glasses, the head of Meta got onstage for a live demo of the company’s latest wearables and A.I. products. But then: glitches, awkward silence, the repeated ringing of a video call, nervous laughter from the crowd. “This is, uh, you know, it happens,” Zuckerberg said, tightly. He and his fellow-titans are endlessly, grotesquely unaccountable to the public—a distinction on full display this year on the dais at the Presidential Inauguration; in the halls of the newly “optimized” federal government; and along the canals of Venice. But, every so often, the gods concoct a minor tragedy for even the most powerful mortals, and a glimpse of life’s futility—and perhaps even its ever-present mortality—breaks briefly through. For a fleeting moment, Zuckerberg was like the rest of us, just another guy who can’t get his device to work.\nCurtis Sliwa’s Sick Burns\nSliwa came in a distant third in another unsuccessful race for New York City mayor, behind Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo. But the beret-wearing, cat-rescuing, parade-loving pol won where it really matters, landing the sharpest barbs of the campaign. Responding to calls by the billionaire political dabbler Bill Ackman to drop out of the race, Sliwa mocked Ackman’s suburban home address and eccentric foray into professional tennis, and chided, “Come on, Ackman, stay in your lane.” And during an appearance on Fox News, Sliwa delivered what may be, word for word, the most deliriously cutting political takedown in recent memory, referring to an opponent’s alleged instances of sexual harassment and COVID-era mismanagement in a single phrase. “Andrew Cuomo is a creep,” Sliwa declared, “slappin’ fannies and killin’ grannies.”\n“Six seven.”\nJust kidding—sort of.\n“South Park” Tells Us to Relax\nWhat’s left to say about Donald Trump? The co-creators of “South Park,” Trey Parker and Matt Stone, fresh off a $1.5 billion deal with Paramount, found something new. The show’s impish pairing of the President and Satan, in a love affair that recalled an earlier romance that Parker and Stone had imagined between the devil and Saddam Hussein, got the bulk of the attention. But their key comedic insight was a bit more subtle. As astonished characters demand that Trump explain his latest outrageous decision, the President bleats back, “Relax, guy,” and “Take a rest,” then blithely carries on. “Relax,” I began to see, may be the defining ethos of Trump 2.0, insisted upon by a coterie of emboldened mini-Trumps, all doing their best impression of the boss. Graft, lawlessness, contempt for decency—this is all normal now, they seem to say, and objecting to any of it is the new form of crazy. Relax, take a rest, we’ve got a country to bleed dry.\nThe Sexy Thieves in Paris\nNews of the jewelry heist at the Louvre arrived like a dispatch from a different era—when world events could be strange and surprising without going fully apocalyptic. In this case, we got a romantic location, a nonviolent crime, even a dapper bystander in a fedora. A portion of the public was predisposed to root for the alleged thieves—even before fake mug shots began circulating online, imagining them as hunky male models. Jake Schroeder, the grinning TikTok balladeer, captured the mood. “The two dudes that robbed the Louvre are literally sexy as hell,” he sang. “Steal me, feel me, Louvre me, do me.”\nJ. D. Vance Skis in Jeans\nIn another fine year for protest signs, one welcoming the Vice-President to Vermont rose above the rest. The day before departing for a family ski vacation, Vance had scolded the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, during a tense exchange in the Oval Office. (“Have you said thank you once?”) The next day, Vermonters, perhaps the crankiest libs in the nation, responded with one of the Northeast’s coldest insults: “VANCE SKIS IN JEANS.”\nKaty Perry Fails to Get Lost in Space\nIt was a fair bet that penis rockets would always be the funniest thing about Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin space business. But this year, Amazon’s founder sent Katy Perry briefly into sub-orbit, where, confined to a small capsule and overcome with the cosmic significance of her roughly eleven-minute voyage, she serenaded her crewmates with Louis Armstrong’s “What a Wonderful World.” Back on Earth—and presumably before she read the comments on social media—Perry told reporters, “I feel super connected to love.” She wasn’t the only one. In the fall, the Daily Mail published photos of Perry making out with Justin Trudeau, Canada’s newly available former Prime Minister.\nThe Joy of a Few Small Beers\nEveryone’s got an opinion these days about how men should behave—how we might rescue ourselves from whatever stunted, angry malaise has befallen us. Maybe more people should be asking, What would Sensei Sergio St. Carlos do? He’s the character played by Benicio del Toro in Paul Thomas Anderson’s “One Battle After Another,” a karate teacher with, as he describes it, “a little Latino Harriet Tubman situation going on.” As Sensei hides besieged immigrant families from a semi-lawless and fully vicious federal immigration force, he remains calm, competent, dedicated to justice, and lightly amused at the fuss all around him. What’s his secret? When cops pull him over as he attempts to save the day, an officer asks if he’s been drinking. “I’ve had a few,” he admits. “A few what?” the officer asks—and Sensei responds, smiling to himself, “A few small beers.” So, cheers: 2025 has been another doozy, and we all deserve a few. ♦",

        "text": "The question on some Brazilians’ minds now might be, “How do you say ‘Taco’ — or ‘Trump Always Chickens Out’ — in Portuguese?” The query, delivered with a grin, reflects recent developments in international trade relations.\n\nJust four months ago, U.S. President Donald Trump announced an increase in tariffs on Brazilian imports, raising them to a hefty 50%. This move came in response to Brazil’s legal scrutiny of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, and its actions against major U.S. tech companies.\n\nIn a show of defiance, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva stood firm against what many perceived as bullying tactics, which in turn bolstered his popularity at home. Meanwhile, a Brazilian judge has since sentenced Bolsonaro to jail.\n\nAs for those tariffs? Last week, Trump announced that “certain agricultural imports from Brazil” would no longer face the additional 40% surcharge. In layman’s terms: Lula emerged victorious.\n\nThere are several takeaways from this situation. Firstly, it appears the White House is increasingly concerned about rising cost-of-living issues. Recent polls indicate a decline in consumer confidence, paralleling a drop in Trump’s approval ratings. In response, his administration is actively seeking ways to lower grocery costs, with reducing agricultural tariffs being an obvious strategy.\n\nThe second lesson is that bullies often respond to strength. Yes, craven flattery can sometimes work, too; Switzerland reduced its own tariffs by sending gift-laden, grovelling executives to meet Trump. But China has pursued a path of belligerence with notable results. And Brazil’s defiance suggests that others are learning from Beijing. If nothing else, this suggests that anyone dealing with Trump should start by assessing how to exploit his weak spots.\n\nThird: it pays to distinguish between tactics and goals when looking at the White House. That might not sound obvious, given Trump often seems to be woefully short of clear strategy. Indeed, his stance on Brazil, Ukraine and the Jeffrey Epstein case — to name but a few issues — has been so capricious that unpredictability is arguably the only predictable trait.\n\nAnd — unsurprisingly — many critics interpret this policy capriciousness as either a sign of gross incompetence or personality disorders, or both; like a Tudor king, Trump’s narcissistic whims appear to drive his “court”. \n\nBut I think a more helpful frame is to borrow advice given to new recruits at some US investment banks, namely to try to identify in any action a hierarchy of “goals”, “strategies” and “tactics”. \n\nFor, while Trump does not operate with clearly articulated policy goals of the sort that a banker might recognise, he is certainly driven by strong instincts. Most notably, his “Make America Great Again” tag reflects a consistent desire to achieve extreme economic and political dominance, for both the country and his inner circle. (As befits a quasi-king, these two often seem intertwined.) \n\nMoreover, this instinct is being turned into strategies by advisers. These can be contradictory, partly because of fights between White House factions. However their leitmotif is “geoeconomic” policymaking, ie a desire to use economic policies to bolster hegemonic power, in a way that repudiates both late 20th-century neoliberal thinking and the collaborative postwar Bretton Woods approach. \n\nAnd this strategy not only uses networks to fight for dominance, as the political scientists Grégoire Mallard and Jin Sun have observed, but also jumbles up economics, politics, culture, tech, military and individual grievances. Hence Trump’s attempt to use tariffs to force Brazil to release Bolsonaro, or his ally’s threat to impose tariffs on Norway after its sovereign wealth fund divested from Caterpillar. \n\nBeneath this, there are also tactics. These echo the modus operandi Trump used to cut deals in business: bullying, threats, melodrama, policy swings, favouritism and “flood the zone” announcements, to cite the president’s former strategist Steve Bannon.\n\nThose aggressive tactics grab attention; indeed, they are planned to do so. But eye-catching or not, they should not be confused with goals or strategies. The aim is to gain leverage against rivals in a transactional world. \n\nThese tools do not always work. Hence that “Taco” quip, which arose because Trump has often watered down tariff threats. But it is precisely because these melodramatic moves are often tactics — not deeply held ideological goals — that the White House feels able to pivot without a blush, discarding moves if they backfire or bigger priorities emerge. That’s why Brazilian tariffs suddenly vanished last week, and why Trump has just embraced Zohran Mamdani, the newly elected New York mayor, after viciously attacking him.\n\nOf course, some observers might dismiss this analysis as mere “sane washing”, an effort to make the White House team seem more logical than they really are. Fair enough; I would not deny the capricious nature of Trump. \n\nBut the key point is this: even if you scoff at Trump, it pays to separate the signal from the noise. In that sense, Lula’s triumph has sent some distinctly encouraging signals for the Europeans and others. Kings are rarely as all-powerful as they seem.\n\ngillian.tett@ft.com",

        "text": "Democrats’ favorite word lately is \"affordability.\" They have painted the false narrative that the election of socialist Mayor Zohran Mamdani in solidly blue New York City or Democrat Gov. Abigail Spanberger in solidly blue Virginia were somehow referenda on President Donald Trump’s agenda. This fallacy not only ignores the recent past but also misses the facts immediately in front of us that Trump’s policies are making America affordable again. Prices soared during the Biden administration. Inflation rose at a near 5% annualized rate during his term. Such a disaster is second only to the severe Carter-led inflation of the 1970s, which collapsed U.S. living standards. Contrast this with Trump’s first term, when inflation rose at less than a 2% annualized rate. The memory of low inflation and strong economic growth during Trump’s first term inspired Americans to re-elect him for a second term. Voters put their trust in Trump’s stewardship after a disastrous four years of economic hardship under Biden. Immediately after taking office, Trump began laying the groundwork for a Golden Age economy. While there is still much work ahead to help Americans out of the hole created by the Biden administration, we are making progress. The first step was passing the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB), which will help Make America Affordable Again. There are three key provisions in the OBBB that will boost take-home worker pay. TRUMP FLIPS DEMS' 'AFFORDABILITY' SCRIPT, TURNING BUZZWORD INTO MAGA MATERIAL AS MAMDANI VISIT LOOMS First is permanent full expensing of business investment, or what is commonly referred to as capital expenditures (or \"capex\"). Thanks to this bold tax incentive, companies can now write off the full cost of purchasing computers, industrial machinery, software and any other equipment. When firms raise their capex, productivity increases since workers have additional capital to produce the goods and services businesses and consumers want. Greater productivity, in turn, raises household living standards by providing companies the ability to pay their workers more. Economic history is replete with examples when surging productivity produced large increases in worker wages. The second provision in the OBBB dovetails with the capex incentive but may be even more powerful. Companies can now deduct the entire cost of building a manufacturing plant or agricultural structure in the first year of construction. In the past, companies had to wait nearly 40 years to depreciate the full cost of factories and farm structure. But not anymore. This novel tax incentive will lead to a massive increase in industrial building and support reshoring of our supply chains. With that will come high-paying construction jobs. And when the project is done, there will be high-paying jobs inside those structures, where workers will be using the newest technologies thanks to the capex incentives. The effect will be an industrial boom. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION In tandem, a capex and industrial construction boom will increase the economy’s underlying productive capacity, which in the past has always been disinflationary. This means that inflation is poised to fall much further, thereby giving workers an added lift. This is a one-two punch in restoring worker purchasing power because nominal wages will be rising at the same time inflation will be falling. The upshot is a powerful historical gain in real wages, similar but even bigger than Trump’s first term. The third provision that will improve affordability is no tax on tips or overtime pay. By eliminating these taxes, working Americans will get to keep more of their hard-earned income. This is critical to restoring household finances to lower- and middle-class families, which suffered disproportionately under the prior administration. Real after-tax wages for blue collar workers are poised to soar thanks to Trump’s policies and economic vision. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP From higher take-home pay for hardworking families to tax incentives that will drive a disinflationary boom, the One Big Beautiful Bill was engineered to Make America Affordable Again. This historic tax reform will ensure that Main Street prospers alongside Wall Street in President Trump’s Golden Age economy.",

        "text": "For months before his victory at the November 4 election, Florida politicians and real estate agents were courting fearful and disgruntled wealthy New Yorkers who would find their lives getting a little bit harder under the leadership of Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani.\n\nScott Singer, mayor of Boca Raton, went as far as placing a big, flashy ad on a digital billboard in Times Square earlier this year to convince New Yorkers to move out of the Big Apple and relocate to Palm Beach County. “Dear NYC, it’s not you, it’s me,” the ad reads.\n\nNow that 34-year-old Mamdani is officially New York City’s mayor-elect, many in the Sunshine State are sure that a new wave of migration from the Northeast is about to happen.\n\n“I know a lot of realtors who are getting a lot of calls from people from New York—something is happening. I cannot tell you what is the intensity, or how many people would be moving… but I guess, in a couple of months from now, we are going to see things happening,” Pascal Nicolai, CEO of Miami-based luxury home construction company Sabal Luxury Builder, told Newsweek during a phone interview.\n\nA ‘New Home’ Waiting In Florida\n\nJaime Sturgis, CEO of Fort Lauderdale-based real estate company Native Realty, told Newsweek that clients “up in the Northeast” started calling him right after the polls started suggesting Mamdani might win the city’s mayoral election. \n\n“Many of them at that point in time started planning essentially their departure from that state to relocate their assets down to South Florida,” he said. “Now I have several clients actively looking to close on properties before the end of the year,” he added.\n\nAsked why so many New Yorkers are in a hurry to move down to Florida, Sturgis speaks of “the proverbial straw in the camel’s back.”\n\nMany of his clients, he said, had been “kind of one foot out the door for quite some time”, with a few of them already selling a portion of their portfolio when they moved to Florida during the pandemic. \n\nBut, at the time, they were keeping some real estate holdings in New York City. Now, he said, “they want to move everything down and they want out. So they’re selling their portfolios in their entirety and they’re relocating down here.”\n\nMost of South Florida—from Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties to Broward and Dave counties—is expected to win big from this expected exodus of New Yorkers out of the Big Apple.\n\nIn a Zoom interview with Newsweek, Singer said that he has had “thousands of people” respond to the ad, which was shown in New York City and other key markets such as Chicago and San Francisco, with people checking out the Boca Raton website promoted on the digital billboard.\n\n“Immediately, we got a number of inquiries just within the first few weeks from ten different states,” Singer said. “We’ve seen businesses come already, and we’re continuing to have constructive dialogues with companies that have reached out since the election, as they want to come to a lower tax jurisdiction with a great talent base and high quality of life,” he added.\n\nFlorida politicians and real estate agents are eagerly awaiting an exodus of disgruntled wealthy New Yorkers after Zohran Mamdani’s victory. (Newsweek)\n\nFor some of these people, buying a home in the Sunshine State almost comes at no cost. “You have to imagine, you can buy a house in Florida by sending money on taxes on a ten-year payout, and you have the house for free,” Nicolai said.\n\nObviously, moving to Florida is not for everyone. Singer’s ad, case in point, was not targeted to everyday New Yorkers, but business owners and leaders looking for corporate relocations, the Boca Raton mayor said.\n\n“We are not planning, not able and not interested in welcoming every New York resident who wants to flee the city. We’re a fairly built-out city, and we’re not looking to accommodate them,” Singer said. “But we do have class-A office space that already exists or is under construction. That would be a great new home for some of these companies, and we have a great talent base here,” he added.\n\nFeeding The South Florida Dream\n\nMigration from the Northeast to Florida is nothing new for the Sunshine State. Businesses have been relocating from up north and the east coast long before the latest New York City mayoral election—and Singer hopes this movement will continue and even accelerate in the aftermath of Mamdani’s victory.\n\n“We’ve seen substantial business growth, and we’ve been a haven for business since the 1960s, when IBM [International Business Machines] had its corporate headquarters here in Boca Raton. So we have that tradition of innovation and strong punching above our weight when it comes to business has continued to attract businesses,” Singer said.\n\nBoca Raton has been targeting business people working in sectors ranging from technology, financial services, fintech and medtech to health care, biotech, AI and quantum computing.

        "text": "This was classic “Purim Torah” — a real question of halakhah, Jewish law, wrapped in a premise so absurd that it could only be a joke. None of us actually believed that a proud, self-professing socialist who rejected the Jewish people’s right to a state in our ancestral homeland and who had trouble bringing himself to condemn the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust could ever win the mayorship of the most Jewish city in the world outside of Israel. It felt as impossible as snow in August.\n\nYet here we are, six months later, and the snow is piling up. Mamdani is the mayor-elect. The joke is now the law. And every New Yorker, Jewish or not, is asking the same question: Now what?\n\nThe coming Trump-Mamdani cage match\n\nThe night of Nov. 4, 2025, might one day be remembered the way Oct. 25, 1917, the occasion of the Bolsheviks’ storming the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, Russia, is remembered in other contexts: the moment the temperature changed. At 11:47 p.m., with 97% of scanners reporting, the Associated Press called it: Zohran Kwame Mamdani, 34, a state assemblyman from Astoria and a card-carrying member of the Democratic Socialists of America, had beaten former Gov. Andrew Cuomo 50.4%-46.1% in a general election with turnout in the Bronx and upper Manhattan rivaling presidential-year numbers.\n\nMamdani’s victory speech in a converted Bushwick warehouse was pure defiance: “President Trump, the people of New York just voted. We are ready to fight for every single dollar this city has earned.” The room shook with cheers. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump, watching from the White House, fired off a Truth Social taunt during the speech: “Communist just took NYC — sad! We’ll see about those funds.” By morning, allies amplified warnings on federal aid, though Trump himself signaled openness to talks.\n\nThe numbers behind the impending federal vs. city government fight are terrifying. New York receives roughly $10 billion in federal aid every year, including grants and reimbursements. Mamdani’s first-term agenda — fare-free buses (approximately $650 million annually), city-owned grocery stores in the 27 food-apartheid neighborhoods ($300 million startup plus $180 million yearly), universal public child care ($5 billion a year), a fast-track to a $30 minimum wage by 2030 — either requires that federal money to stay intact or the full $10 billion in new corporate and millionaire taxes he has promised. Trump can kill the first option with one executive order. He has done it before, and he is eager to do it again.\n\nLegal war rooms are already humming. Mamdani’s transition has quietly retained Neal Katyal, the ACLU’s state-power litigation team, and half the public-law faculty at the City University of New York for a barrage of 10th Amendment and anticommandeering lawsuits. On the other side, Trump’s attorney general will have a menu of pressure points: Title 8 enforcement, Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants, Community-Oriented Policing Services hiring money, and even threatening to pull Secret Service details if the mayor travels to Israel or the West Bank. The first federal complaint could land before the new mayor finishes his inaugural address on Jan. 1, 2026.\n\nWhen Trump and Mamdani met at the White House in November, it was cordial. Trump expressed high hopes for Mamdani’s mayorship and even appeared to forgive the Democrat for calling him a fascist. But the warmth between them seems unlikely to last.\n\nThe slow-motion economic exodus\n\nWalk into any Midtown steakhouse the week after the election, and the conversation was identical: “How fast can we get the Gulfstream fueled?”\n\nMamdani never pretended to be anything other than what he is. His platform was printed, bound, and posted online months in advance: an 11.5% corporate tax, the highest in the continental United States; a city income tax surcharge that pushes the combined city-state rate for incomes over $1 million to 14.8%; vacancy taxes on landlords who keep apartments empty; commercial-rent control; strict good-cause eviction statewide; and a phased $30 minimum wage by 2030. He sold it as simple arithmetic: take from the top 1%, deliver to the bottom 80%.\n\nThe top 1% started moving the decimal points. Whispers of a corporate exodus have filled Midtown. Florida real estate listings have spiked, with firms such as Citadel eying Miami expansions. Real estate titans insist that the sky isn’t falling — at least not yet. Still, the fear is that permanent rent freezes and the elimination of vacancy decontrol could force firms to rethink every property they own in the city.\n\nThe carnage for small businesses is only beginning to be modeled. Between projected increases in overtime, payroll taxes, and workers’ compensation during the Mamdani mayorship, analyses from City Journal and ProMarket have estimated that many small businesses are facing the choice of reducing their employees’ hours, laying them off, or relocating. And in the restaurant industry, a staple of the city, early models suggest that 15%-20% of eateries would be at risk of closures without federal subsidies.\n\nMamdani waves away the exodus talk the same way former Mayor Bill de Blasio once did: “They said the same thing when we went to $15. The city didn’t collapse.” That’s true, but $15 to $30 in five years while commercial rents, utility rates, and liability insurance are all spiking 8%-15% annually is a different equation. And this time, the rich really can leave: Zoom, Starlink, and red-state governors waving zero-income-tax flags have removed the last remaining handcuffs.\n\nA quieter but equally ominous trend is already visible in the city’s ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods. Real estate brokers in Borough Park and Williamsburg have been reporting an uptick in inquiries from large families looking to relocate to Lakewood, Monsey, or even Kiryas Joel — places in New York state where housing is cheaper, schools are private, and the local government is unlikely to impose the same tax burden or cultural shifts. For the first time in decades, the great New York City Jewish migration is pointing outward, not inward.\n\nThe Democratic Party’s new poster child nobody wanted\n\nHBO host Bill Maher waited exactly three nights to unload. “Democratic socialism is like a dating profile. Things look great until you meet up in the real world. For example, Bernie Sanders. His big thing was always bringing single-payer healthcare to our country of 340 million. But when liberal, tie-dyed Vermont tried to do it for a population of 626,000, it collapsed. … Bernie, AOC, Mamdani are not Democrats. They’ll be the first to tell you they’re democratic socialists. And that’s a very different thing. And I don’t think people know yet.” The studio audience was noticeably quieter than usual.\n\nDemocratic strategist James Carville spent the weekend on every cable show calling Mamdani a “gift” that will keep on giving for Republicans through 2032. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) never endorsed Mamdani in either the primary or the general election. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) issued a two-sentence statement of congratulations and then disappeared from the Sunday shows. Govs. Kathy Hochul (D-NY) and Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) found urgent scheduling conflicts when asked if they would campaign with the new mayor. While the old Democratic guard fretted, progressives hailed Mamdani’s election as a blueprint for the nascent New Left.\n\nRepublican ad makers are already in overdrive. One 30-second spot being tested in Pennsylvania and Ohio ends with Mamdani’s victory speech superimposed over archival footage of bread lines in Caracas and empty shelves in Havana, closing with the words, “This is the Democratic Party now.”\n\nInside the party, the fracture is now a canyon. The DSA and Justice Democrats are celebrating the blueprint: 250,000 doors knocked, 200,000 new voter registrations, and 72% turnout among 18- to 29-year-olds. The old guard — Third Way, the Problem Solvers Caucus, every vulnerable House Democrat from Nassau to Westchester — is in full panic. They know every suburban soccer mom from Bucks County, Pennsylvania, to DuPage County, Illinois, will see Mamdani’s face next fall with the tagline “This is who runs the Democratic Party now.”\n\nJewish New Yorkers in uncharted waters\n\nFor the city’s 1.3 million Jews, the victory landed like a gut punch in the wake of Oct. 7, 2023. Mamdani has never hidden his positions. As a Bowdoin College undergraduate, he founded the campus chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine. In Albany, he co-sponsored the “Not On Our Dime!” bill to strip tax-exempt status from any nonprofit organization that funds West Bank settlements. After Hamas murdered 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7, his first public statement mourned “all civilian life lost” without once naming the perpetrators. In debates, he has repeatedly called Zionism “a settler-colonial ideology,” Israel an “apartheid state,” and refused to affirm that the Jewish people have a right to national self-determination in their ancestral homeland. Irish people are allowed to have a state of their own in Ireland, and Italians in Italy, but for some reason, for the mayor-elect of New York, Israelites having a state of their own in Israel is a bridge too far.\n\nMore than 1,000 rabbis — Reform, Conservative, Orthodox, Reconstructionist — signed an open letter before the election, labeling his positions antisemitic. The Anti-Defamation League called him “the most radical anti-Israel candidate ever to win citywide office in the United States.” The American Jewish Committee said his repeated use of the word “genocide” to describe Israel’s actions in Gaza “delegitimizes the existence of the Jewish state and endangers Jewish safety worldwide.” Outgoing Mayor Eric Adams, speaking from Jerusalem days after the vote, told reporters bluntly: “Jewish New Yorkers should be scared.”\n\nThe Jewish vote fractured along generational and ideological lines. In Orthodox strongholds — Borough Park, Williamsburg, Flatbush, and Kew Gardens Hills — Cuomo crushed Mamdani by margins as high as 88%-9%. In the secular, liberal enclaves of Manhattan and brownstone Brooklyn, Mamdani often topped 65%. Jews for Racial & Economic Justice, IfNotNow, and Jewish Voice for Peace knocked doors for him. The traditional federations, synagogues, and day schools mobilized against him.\n\nSince the election, synagogue WhatsApp groups and listservs have been flooded with practical questions about aliyah, emigration to Israel; private-school security grants; and whether it’s time to move to Teaneck, New Jersey, or Boca Raton, Florida, also known as the American Holy Lands. Several major donors who traditionally fund Democratic mayors have informed City Hall fundraisers that contributions are “on pause” until they see how the new administration handles campus protests, hate-crime enforcement, and the annual Israel Day Parade.\n\nMamdani has made gestures — private meetings with UJA-Federation of New York leadership, a promise to increase anti-hate crime funding by 800%, a pledge to keep the Holocaust curriculum intact, and even add lessons on “Zionism as a form of Jewish self-determination.” But when pressed in those meetings on whether he will ever affirm Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state, the answer is always the same: “I support equal rights for all inhabitants from the river to the sea.” For most affiliated Jews, that is not reassurance. It is erasure.\n\nThe city holds its breath\n\nNew York has survived bankruptcy scares, blackouts, the crack epidemic, 9/11, Hurricane Sandy, and COVID-19. It will survive Zohran Mamdani. But survival is not the same as flourishing.\n\nThe next four years will be defined by four simultaneous wars that a Mamdani-led city will be compelled to wage: with the White House over federal dollars, with capital over taxes and regulation, with the Democratic Party over ideology, and with the Jewish community over identity, safety, and the meaning of peoplehood in a city whose mayor refuses to acknowledge that Jews have a right to a homeland.\n\nThe buses might actually go free. City-owned grocery stores might open in every food desert. Childcare might become universal. Rents might finally stop rising. But on some future Shabbos morning, a charedi father in Williamsburg or a Modern Orthodox mother in Riverdale might actually have to pull out a new volume of halakhic responsa and look up the law about riding a fare-free municipal bus on Saturday. Only this time, nobody’s laughing. The snow is here. The question is whether New York digs out — or gets buried.\n\nDaniel Ross Goodman is a Washington Examiner contributing writer and the Allen and Joan Bildner Visiting Scholar at Rutgers University.

Trump’s lavish praise of New York’s mayor-elect in the Oval Office was a 180-degree turn from his condemnation of the democratic socialist as “a pure true communist” and “a total nut job.” The stunning about-face made for a great political drama. But what does it portend?\n\nTrump and his MAGA followers are hardly going to forsake their standard mix of bigotry, anti-immigrant mania and other political toxins. Demagoguery fuels the Republican engine — and in the 11 months until the midterm elections, skullduggery to thwart democracy will accelerate rather than slow down.\n\nWhile countless media outlets have marveled at the appearance of a sudden Trump-Mamdani “bromance,” the spectacle has rekindled hopes that America can become less polarized and find more common ground. But what kind of common ground can — or should — be found with the leader of today’s fascistic GOP?\n\nIt’s true that Mamdani has a huge stake in diverting the Trump bull from goring New York. Billions of dollars are at stake in federal aid to the city. And the metropolis would be thrown into a chaotic crisis if Trump goes ahead with his threats to send in federal troops. Mamdani seems to have deftly prevented such repressive actions against his city, at least for a while.\n\nUnderstandably, Mamdani’s main concern is his upcoming responsibility for New York City and its 8.5 million residents. But important as the Big Apple is, Trump’s draconian and dictatorial orders nationwide are at stake. It’s unclear that the chemistry between the two leaders will do anything at all to help protect immigrants in Chicago or Los Angeles or anywhere else in the country.\n\nThe president’s accolades for a leftist certainly confounded the perennial left-bashers at Fox News and many other right-wing outlets. Such discombobulation among pro-MAGA media operatives has been a pleasure to behold. But there’s more than a wisp of wishful thinking in the air from progressives eager to believe that Trump’s effusive statements about Mamdani, an avowed socialist, will help to legitimize socialism for the U.S. public.\n\nTrump’s widely reported and astonishing turnaround about Mamdani might cause some Americans to reconsider their anti-left reflexes. But it’s also plausible that ripple effects of the episode could help to legitimize, in some people’s eyes, Trump’s leadership even while it continues to inflict horrific policies and anti-democratic politics on the United States. Gracious and avuncular performances by despots are nothing new. Neither are cosmetics on the face of a fascist.\n\nA hazard is that the image of Trump as a tolerant and open-minded leader, in convivial discourse with New York’s progressive leader, could undercut the solid accusations that Trump is imposing tyrannical policies on America. Just a day before he met with Mamdani, the president publicly suggested the execution of several Democrats in Congress.\n\nThe most publicized few seconds of the Trump-Mamdani session with reporters was when a journalist asked about Mamdani’s past charge that Trump is a fascist. The interchange was widely reported as an amusing moment.\n\nThe danger of normalizing autocracy is heightened when the utterly serious appraisal of Trump as a fascist can be recast as a media punchline.\n\nOver the weekend, Mamdani stood his ground during an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, pointing out that in the Oval Office he had said “yes” to the reporter’s question about Trump being a fascist. And he added, “Everything that I’ve said in the past, I continue to believe.”\n\nHow long Mamdani will remain in Trump’s good graces is anyone’s guess. No doubt the mayor-elect is fully aware that Trump could turn on him with a vengeance. If Trump can do that to one of his most loyal ideological fighters, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, as he did recently, he can certainly do it to Mamdani.\n\nTo call Trump “mercurial” is a vast understatement. And yet, in countless ways, with rhetoric and with the power of the presidency, he has been unwavering and consistent — as immigrants being terrorized by ICE agents, or single mothers trying to feed their families, know all too well. Given all the harm his policies are doing every minute, it would be unwise to take seriously Trump’s broken-clock pronouncements that are occasionally accurate and decent.\n\nDemocratic socialists don’t need Trump’s approval. We need to defeat his MAGA forces. It’s unclear whether what happened with him and Mamdani in the Oval Office will make that defeat any more likely.\n\nNone of this is a criticism of Zohran Mamdani. This is an assessment of how the follow-up to his Oval Office drama with Trump could go sideways.\n\nTrump and Mamdani found each other newly useful last Friday. Only later will we know who was more effectively using whom.\n\nIt’s all well and good to laud Mamdani’s extraordinary political talents and inspiring leadership for social justice. At the same time, we should recognize that he has entered into an embrace with a viperous president.\n\nAnd when a rattlesnake purrs, it’s still a rattlesnake.\n\nNorman Solomon is the national director of RootsAction and executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy.

Even California’s Proposition 50 passed easily, clearing the way for Gov. Gavin Newsom to engineer a Democratic gerrymander.\n\nThe results recall another off-year wave: 2017, when Democrats began their comeback after Trump’s first election. And just as then, this cycle’s success points to a broader realignment: a sign that the MAGA movement, for all its dominance, may finally be losing its grip.\n\nEven Trump seems to sense it. At a post-election breakfast with Senate Republicans, he reportedly lamented the party’s poor showing, blaming his absence from the ballot. It was an unusually candid acknowledgment that his movement may not outlive him.\n\nThat’s the paradox of MAGA: It has always been a one-person show. The movement thrives when Trump’s name is on the ticket and falters when it’s not. \n\nAs president—especially during his first term—he benefited from a fluke stretch of low inflation and a businessman’s aura of competence. But that image has crumbled. His trade wars have fueled price spikes, the cost of living remains punishing, and Trump shows little focus—or interest—in fixing any of it.\n\nDespite Americans’ desire for a secure border, they overwhelmingly believe that immigration is good for the nation. They don’t want ICE raids in their neighborhoods. They also didn’t ask for the destruction of Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency or an ongoing culture war against universities. \n\nAgain and again, Trump and his cronies—Stephen Miller chief among them—have tried to invent crises to justify overreach. Voters appear to have had enough.\n\nTrump’s approval ratings have plummeted, and his political brand looks exhausted. For rank-and-file Republicans who’ve tied their fortunes to him, a painful realization is setting in: Trump isn’t eternal.\n\nStill, he could defy expectations—as he usually does—but time and reality are catching up. His second term has exposed the weakness at the core of his movement: Without him at the top, it splinters. And as legal and political pressure mounts, even Trump seems to understand what his allies won’t say aloud—the era of MAGA dominance is nearing its end.\n\nThe question now is what comes next. When Trump exits the stage, the GOP will face a civil war over its future. The peace he kept through sheer force of personality will collapse, leaving behind factions too divided to win nationally.\n\nFor now, Trump still wields enormous power. He can keep punishing blue states, bullying universities, and terrorizing immigrants. What he can’t do is make Americans like it.\n\nHe governed as though his narrow 2024 popular-vote win was a sweeping mandate. It wasn’t—and the country is recoiling from what that assumption has unleashed. And now, MAGA’s future looks far murkier than it did a year ago.\n\nThe only real question left is how Trump leaves the stage: by choice or by scandal. His authoritarian instincts make all scenarios possible. But America’s saving grace may be its federal structure—and the sheer incompetence of the movement he built. Full-blown autocracy, it turns out, is challenging to maintain.\n\nAs the year winds down, even Trump may be starting to grasp that.",

Hegseth obeyed. And now they’re mad about Kelly and the Democrats calling them out on it. \n\nBut impunity is only half the story. The other half is contempt. \n\nOr it should be. \n\nThat’s why I was pleased to see Mark Kelly’s appearance on Rachel Maddow’s show this week. At the end, she asked how he was doing – if the stress of the president’s threats were getting to him and his family. \n\nMark Kelly is a decorated combat pilot. He flew close to 40 missions during the First Gulf War. He was an astronaut. His wife survived an attempted assassination. To my ears, his reply was contemptuous – not of Maddow’s question, but of the idea that Trump can intimidate him.\n\n“I’ve had a missile blowup next to my airplane. I’ve been nearly shot down multiple times. I’ve flown a rocket ship into space four times. … My wife, Gabby Gifford, meeting her constituents, shot in the head, six people killed around her. A horrific thing. She spent six months in the hospital. We know what political violence is and we know what causes it, too. The statements that Donald Trump has made are inciteful. He’s got millions of supporters. People listen to what he says more than anybody else in the country. He should be careful with his words. \n\n“But I’m not gonna be silenced here. Is it stressful? I’ve been stressed by things more important than Donald Trump trying to intimidate me in shutting my mouth and not doing my job. He didn’t like what I said. I’m gonna show up for work every day, support the Constitution, do my job, hold this administration accountable – hold this president accountable when he is out of line. That’s the responsibility of every US senator and every member of Congress. He’s not gonna silence us.”\n\nThe written word can do a lot but it can’t carry the emotion in the bolded sentence above. Listen for yourself. What I hear is contempt.\n\nThat’s what this country needs to hear. That’s what this country needs to hear from men like United States Senator Mark Kelly. America needs more contempt for impunity for the law, morality and decency, and for one more thing – untouchable elites, like Trump, who never grew up.\n\nLast week, when Trump met New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, he met a man who, like Mark Kelly, could not be intimidated. The reaction from the president, according to Bruce Fanger, was “that strange little-boy energy, the hero-worship vibe, like he’s suddenly standing in line for an autograph from someone who embodies a version of power he’ll never actually possess: calm, earned, rooted.”\n\nYou could say Trump’s behavior with Mamdani was obsequious, Fanger said, but there’s more to it. There’s “that schoolboy glow — ‘Notice me. Approve of me. Let me stand near your seriousness so I look serious too.’ It’s the emotional posture of someone who’s been trying to cosplay adulthood for 50 years and gets starstruck by the real thing” (my italics).\n\nTrump has lived a long life believing he’s the exception to every rule – that he will never face the consequences of his choices, not even the seemingly heinous, like association with known child-sex trafficker. \n\nOnly the little people are accountable, not this One Special Boy.\n\nThat deserves contempt, or at least righteous anger, which is what D Earl Stephens heard in Kelly’s voice when I asked him. In any case, Earl said, it’s amazing that everyone isn’t feeling one of those emotions.\n\nEarl is the former managing editor of Stars and Stripes, a newspaper covering the military and military affairs. He now publishes the newsletter Enough Already. Like me, he’s a regular contributor to Raw Story. “Either we are a law-abiding country or we aren't,” he told me. \n\nHere’s my short interview with Earl.\n\nRachel Maddow asked Mark Kelly if he was stressed by the president's attempts to intimidate him. Kelly's answer dripped with contempt. Is that the spirit we need to see from the Democrats?\n\nI didn't hear contempt. I heard righteous anger, and I just don't know how everybody isn't angry at this point right now.\n\nPete Hegseth talks endlessly about \"warriors.\" Yet by his words and deeds, he's a fool. This is evident to the personnel inside of the military, isn't it? Or are there too many people willing to play along?\n\nSorry to say, there are far too many people willing to play along. Hegseth speaks to far too many young, immature white men, who are angry and aren't even sure why. They are led by their emotions, which is why we lean on them to do most of our fighting.\n\nRuben Gallego put it in terms of manliness. What's your view?\n\nThis is 100 percent correct, and goes to my earlier point of immaturity.\n\nAm I right to say Kelly is going to get more famous thanks to Trump that Trump will look at him the way he looked at Zohran Mamdani?\n\nYou are. The more people get to know Kelly, the more they will be impressed by him. “Patriot” is a word that is tossed around too much, but Kelly fits the definition.\n\nIs accountability the direction the Democrats need to go on? Whether it's the cabinet or ICE thugs? \n\nI just don't see another direction. Either we are a law-abiding country or we aren't. This all should have been nipped in the bud with urgency following the attack on January 6. For whatever reason, Joe Biden and/or Merrick Garland dawdled, and allowed Trump a second wind. \n\nWe damn well better learn from that.",

        "text": "Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin celebrated recent electoral wins by his party and said because of the victories, he doesn't want to hear about the party having a problem with young male voters ever again. \"I never want to hear again that the Democratic Party has a problem with young men,\" DNC Chair Ken Martin said at a press conference, according to Politico. \"We’re going to keep working hard to keep them in our camp and our coalition, for sure, but we won across the board with every major constituency that left our party last year, and that should tell you something again, that the Democratic Party is back.\" Since the 2024 election, the Democratic Party has been working to figure out how to win back voters from key constituencies like young men. But after the victories of both Virginia governor-elect Abigail Spanberger, a moderate Democrat, and New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a progressive, Martin believes the party is on the right track. FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TALKS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF HIS PARTY AFTER OFF-YEAR ELECTION SUCCESS He reportedly also said that young people feel \"disillusioned\" by the lack of job opportunities, something he blamed on President Donald Trump's administration. Prior to the off-year elections, James Carville, a veteran strategist for the Democratic Party, warned that far-left messaging and policies were hurting the Democratic Party’s image with young men. \"They were told, ‘The future is female, you must always believe the woman is never wrong, #MeToo,'\" Carville said on a podcast in July. \"And men are like, ‘S---, do I count? What about my life? I mean, we're only 48% of the voting population.’\" More recently, he has argued that any future president from either party will have to move in a more economically populist direction to win back young people who cannot afford the same standard of living as their parents and grandparents. KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE 2025 ELECTIONS In March, New York Times columnist Ezra Klein spoke with a Democratic pollster David Shor about how \"75-year-old White men supported Kamala Harris at a significantly higher rate than 20-year-old White men.\" \"It is a real shift,\" Shor agreed. \"This is the thing I am the most shocked by in the last four years — that young people have gone from being the most progressive generation since the Baby Boomers, and maybe even in some ways more so, to becoming potentially the most conservative generation that we’ve experienced maybe in 50 to 60 years.\" NYU professor Scott Galloway argued that the affordability crisis made people turn against Democrats in 2024. He argued in a podcast in November that one of the biggest shifts he noticed in the 2024 election was middle-aged women toward the GOP, suggesting that mothers were voting for Republicans in order to help their struggling sons.

        "text": "The nation will this week partake in a ritual unlike any other in the rest of the world. Americans of all persuasions, races, and creeds will gather with family around the table and give thanks, most of them to the Almighty, for the bounty they have received this year.\n\nIt’s easy to take Thanksgiving for granted. And yet it is something uniquely American, and truly a wonder. It is a holiday that confirms that we as a country are committed to gratitude and to recommitting ourselves annually to this national character trait.\n\nIt acts as some sort of baptismal sacrament. Immigrants take their first timorous step toward Americanization when they start honoring this sacred holiday and learn to cook its dishes. And thereby, without being fully aware, they begin to incarnate the national spirit.\n\nIn personal terms, a disposition to be grateful renders important benefits, reducing anxiety and depression, and making us better companions and better sleepers. This is so self-evident it hardly requires research to substantiate it, but the evidence does exist.\n\nIn geopolitics, the thankful disposition draws a bright line between the United States and wretched states officially devoted to its opposite, ungratefulness. A commitment to gratitude may have been one of the things—right up there with love of liberty—that made America the historic sworn enemy of Marxism, whose guiding ideology, envy, is the wages of ingratitude.\n\nThanksgiving is unquestionably uniquely American. I have lived at least a year in seven countries, in Asia, Europe, and the Americas, many more if one counts shorter stays, and have never encountered anything like it anywhere else.\n\nYes, in East Asia, I experienced firsthand what the Koreans call the Chuseok festival, held on 15th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar, so from late September to early October, depending on the year. But it’s not dedicated to giving thanks, but rather to the full moon.\n\nCanada, Liberia and the Caribbean island-nation of Grenada also have official Thanksgiving days, but they are derivatives of America’s.\n\nThanksgiving is not just uniquely tied to this country because it is reflective of the American national character. Its lineage is the thread of the national quilt.\n\nAnyone who has watched A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, and its companion, The Mayflower Voyagers, will know the essentials of how the first Thanksgiving was celebrated by the Pilgrims and their Indian hosts in 1621 in the Plymouth Colony. Right there, Thanksgiving starts as a needed slap in the face to the “land acknowledgement” crowd.\n\n(And yes, it might be better to read a book and learn history right and not from Peanuts, but don’t underestimate the value of popular culture in propagandizing the national spirit. When Charlie Brown exclaims at the Thanksgiving table, “We thank the Lord for a bountiful harvest,” Hollywood was telling generations of young Americans that it wasn’t just ok to be patriotic and faithful, but that it was normal and expected.)\n\nThen, in one of its very firsts acts, the first Congress in 1789 requested that the newly elected President Washington proclaim a national day of Thanksgiving.\n\nBut it wasn’t till later, in the middle of the Civil War and in response to a persistent, decades-long letter-writing campaign by editor and writer Sarah Josepha Hale, that Abraham Lincoln in 1863 proclaimed the last Thursday in November as our official day of Thanksgiving. Then Congress in 1941, just as America was about to enter another war, officially made it the fourth Thursday.\n\nThus, Congress and our most important leaders ratified an outlook that is the gift that keeps on giving.\n\nExperiencing gratitude is “associated with greater longevity among older adults,” says a Harvard study last year. According to the British Psychological Society, “around 18.5 per cent of individual differences in people’s happiness could be predicted by the amount of gratitude they feel.”\n\nSaying thanks to your partner and meaning it also makes the institution of marriage stronger. A team at the University of Illinois found that “higher levels of perceived gratitude buffered against the stresses of both financial strain and ineffective arguing.” (One could ask, in marriage, is there any other type of arguing?)\n\nMeanwhile, at UC Berkeley, a 2009 study found that “Gratitude was uniquely related to total sleep quality, subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, and daytime dysfunction.”\n\nOf course, Presidents Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt, and the various congresses in question—to say nothing of the Pilgrim fathers, Samoset or Squanto—did not have any of these benefits in mind, they just wanted to thank the Lord. Maybe the unintended consequences are payback.\n\nThat is not going to help you deal with your aunt who voted for Kamala Harris and will show up dressed in a Handmaid’s Tale outfit. Just tell her that if President Trump and Zohran Mamdani can bury the hatchet, she can get along with others, too.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving.\n\nOriginally published by Washington Examiner.",

        "text": "Democratic New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has repeatedly generated headlines for all the wrong reasons, drawing scrutiny that undermines his own polished campaign narrative.\n\nMamdani built his brand on an ambitious socialist platform that promised rent freezes, a $30 minimum wage, government-run services and higher taxes on wealthy residents and corporations. The instances below reflect how a candidate who sold himself as disciplined and principled repeatedly found himself generating headlines he didn’t intend — and for all the wrong reasons, from fundraising pleas and family-story contradictions to awkward policy pivots and viral missteps.\n\n1. Mamdani Solicits Cash From Supporters Even After Winning Office\n\nMamdani kept asking supporters for money long after he won his race, insisting he needed at least $4 million to pay his staff and vet tens of thousands of résumés. He positioned the effort as a grassroots necessity while boasting that his transition would operate without wealthy donors.\n\n We need your help! But let me explain why: pic.twitter.com/RO9d4GTgpm — Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@ZohranKMamdani) November 18, 2025 \n\nMamdani also reminded followers that transition teams receive no public matching funds, claiming their contributions were essential to implementing his socialist platform. (RELATED: Mamdani-Loving Queer Socialist Primaries Hakeem Jeffries)\n\n“Remember how I told you a few months ago to stop sending us money? You can start again,” Mamdani said. “This transition requires staff, research, and an infrastructure that can meet this moment. And it will be made possible by the people who built and believe in this movement. So I hope you’ll make a donation at transition2025.com.”\n\n2. Mamdani Admits His ‘Aunt In Hijab’ Story Wasn’t Quite True\n\nMamdani admitted that the hijab-wearing “aunt” he described in a personal story about post-9/11 fear was not actually his aunt but a distant relative. He clarified that he had been referring to Zehra fuhi, his father’s cousin, who passed away years earlier.\n\nHe attempted to redirect criticism by arguing that opponents were deliberately ignoring the broader point of his remarks on Islamophobia. Still, the discrepancy raised questions about why Mamdani framed the woman as an aunt in the first place.\n\n“I was speaking about my aunt, I was speaking about Zehra fuhi, my father’s cousin who sadly passed away a few years ago,” Mamdani told reporters.\n\n3. Mamdani Pledges An 800% Funding Surge To Court Jewish Voters\n\nMamdani promised to increase hate-crime program funding by 800% as he worked to reassure uneasy Jewish voters. He told MSNBC that he intended to represent all New Yorkers, regardless of whether they supported him or agreed with his political views.\n\nThe pledge emerged as critics resurfaced Mamdani’s past comments on Israel, including his responses to controversial protest slogans. (RELATED: ‘Tired, Worn Sex Pest’: Megyn Kelly Rips Dems For Running Cuomo And Losing)\n\n“My message is that I am looking to lead this entire city, to represent each and every New Yorker. And that representation is not contingent on whether or not someone votes for me or someone agrees with me, because the responsibility of a leader is to reach out to all eight and a half million people who call this city their home,” Mamdani said. “I know that Jewish New Yorkers, like Jewish Americans, are fearful in this moment of antisemitism.”\n\n4. Mamdani Dodges CNN Question About Trump’s Ceasefire Breakthrough\n\nMamdani avoided giving a straight answer when CNN pressed him on whether President Donald Trump deserved credit for brokering a Middle East ceasefire. Instead of acknowledging the question, he pivoted to discussing civilian suffering and the emotional toll of the conflict.\n\nHe argued that any praise should hinge on the agreement’s enforcement rather than on who negotiated it, bypassing Trump’s role entirely. (RELATED: Kaitlan Collins Adds Context After Jake Tapper Downplays Trump’s Israel-Hamas Deal)\n\n“You know I’ll say that the news of a ceasefire leaves me with hope, the images of children celebrating, and I pray that it is lasting. I pray that it delivers peace. And I think that the question of praise should come in the enforcement of this ceasefire,” Mamdani told CNN host Kaitlan Collins. “Because what this agreement can never do is erase what the last few years of tragedy have been for so many, whether it be Hamas’s horrific war crime of October 7 or the Israeli government’s genocide of Palestinians since.”\n\n5. Mamdani’s Painful Bench-Press Stunt Goes Viral On Campaign Trail\n\nMamdani attempted a 135-pound bench press during a Brooklyn community event and failed to complete the lift without assistance from a spotter. The clip spread quickly across social media, showing him struggling under the weight as supporters shouted encouragement.\n\n NEW: Socialist Zohran Mamdani shows off his muscles at Men’s Day in Brooklyn, needs help from a spotter to bench 135 pounds. The 33-year-old was reluctant at first to get under the bar but gave in after being pressured by the locals. pic.twitter.com/7lsOJ3CubM — Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) August 24, 2025 \n\nHe tried to offset the awkward moment by leaning into more comfortable activities, snapping selfies and showing off his soccer skills along Eastern Parkway.

        "text": "Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on Thursday acknowledged moderate Councilmember Julie Menin is slated to be the next City Council speaker, but said he plans to work closely with the lawmaker in steering the government.\n\nAfter volunteering at a Thanksgiving meal giveaway in Harlem with Al Sharpton’s National Action Network, Mamdani told reporters that Menin shares his “excitement at fulfilling the shared agenda of affordability.”\n\nHis comments came a day after Menin announced she’d secured enough support among the next City Council to be its next speaker. The Upper East Side lawmaker did not endorse Mamdani in the general election. Some political observers have said she could act as a check on the mayor-elect’s democratic socialist goals.\n\n“I​​ am looking forward to working with Councilmember Menin and the entire City Council to fulfill the agenda that New Yorkers are desperate for: an agenda of affordability in the most expensive city in the United States of America,” he said.\n\nMamdani sidestepped questions as to whether he could have done more to back other speaker candidates who supported his campaign, like Brooklyn Councilmember Crystal Hudson.\n\nThe Council speaker has broad influence in negotiating the city’s budget, and has control over how legislation moves through the chamber. Current Speaker Adrienne Adams has repeatedly been at loggerheads with Mayor Eric Adams over the last four years, repeatedly using supermajorities to override mayoral vetoes.\n\n“ We are speaking about a co-equal branch of government and also a branch that represents the same set of New Yorkers that I do,” said Mamdani. “And those are the New Yorkers who are asking all of us to do the work of fulfilling an affordability agenda.”",

        "text": "Martin said young people feel “disillusioned” by the lack of opportunities in the job market, a sentiment that he thinks voters largely attribute to the Trump administration. That hypothesis played out in several key races where Democrats’ consistent messaging on affordability paid off.\n\nIn Virginia, Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger won men aged 18-29 by a larger margin than any other age group of male voters, per network exit polls. In New Jersey, Mikie Sherrill beat GOP opponent Jack Ciattarelli by a 14-point margin with the demographic. And in New York City, more than 6 in 10 men in the youngest age group went for democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani.\n\nDemocrats’ strong showing with young male voters comes amid constant worries from within the party that the economic anxiety, cultural alienation and the allure of conservative manosphere content pulled young men toward the Republican Party in recent years.\n\nBut the across-the board wins paper over an ideological divide that’s brewing in the party: Will young men be won back by moderation, or by Mamdani?\n\nMamdani attracted praise from all corners of his party for his ability to reach young men by exploiting the media landscape that catapulted Trump to political success. Still, not all Democrats are convinced that his approach should be a blueprint for Democrats heading into 2026.\n\nLucas Holtz, a senior political adviser at the center-left group Third Way, said Sherrill’s and Spanberger’s decisions to position themselves as moderate alternatives will be more effective at reaching young male voters in key swing states next year.\n\n“In the same vein that we have to be running on lowering costs, making life more affordable, we also have to be hitting Trump, and I think that goes hand in hand with what Spanberger and Sherrill did really well on cultural issues,” he said. “They ran mainstream campaigns all the way — they didn’t get bogged down in any far- left, culturally alienating positions that I think Mamdani really did get bogged down in.”\n\nBut John Della Volpe, the director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics and a one-time Biden adviser, says the party may have a lot to learn from Mamdani.\n\nThe specificity of the Mamdani campaign’s promises, in addition to his focus on “listening, not lecturing,” allowed the democratic socialist to capitalize on the lack of trust young men have in the political establishments of both parties, he said.",

        "text": "In a stark pivot from the preceding administration, New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has asked for the resignation of 179 staff members who were part of Mayor Eric Adams' team. \n\nThe sweeping move includes employees working in offices under the city's deputy mayors and is expected to take effect by the inauguration on January 1, according to CBS News New York. Deputy mayor Fabien Levy criticized the mass terminations, suggesting that the experience of these employees should not have been so readily dismissed.\n\nLevy highlighted the diversity of those affected by the forthcoming exits, stating that \"60% are women and minorities,\" and emphasized their dedication to the city's 8.5 million residents. \n\nThe ousted staff members have weathered numerous city crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the asylum seeker crisis. \n\nThis changeover seems to reflect Mamdani's commitment to a \"new kind of politics,\" noted during his election night speech—a sentiment that Deputy Mayor Levy found surprising for those who assumed their service might be valued beyond political affiliation, as reported by ABC7 New York.\n\nMamdani's transition team is led by a diverse cadre of individuals, including political strategist Elana Leopold and former First Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer. \n\nIn addition, more than 400 people will serve on 17 transitional advisory committees to shape the new administration's policies and appointments. \n\nHis team has boasted of receiving over 70,000 resumes, suggesting a high degree of public interest in participating in this mayoral transition. \n\nAmong the key positions, NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch is set to continue in her role under Mamdani, ensuring some degree of continuity in a key city department.\n\nDespite the wide-scale staffing shifts, Mamdani's administration will inherit an intact leadership core at the NYPD, with Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch confirmed to remain in her position. However, FDNY Commissioner Robert S. Tucker has announced his resignation, citing ideological differences with the incoming administration. Tucker, appointed by Adams just last year, expressed the emotional weight of his departure in a \"CBS Mornings\" interview. As for fundraising efforts, Mamdani's call for transition funds has garnered over $2 million so far, highlighting the community's financial backing for his promise of change.",

Though if they want to know how to talk to Trump, they should ask Zohran [Mamdani],” Meyers said.\n\n“I mean for real, look at that,” he continued, pointing to an image of Trump beaming at the New York City mayor-elect.\n\nMamdani wooed the president on a visit to the White House on Friday, despite previously calling Trump a “despot.” This didn’t seem to impact the president’s opinion of the incoming New York mayor. Trump was left saying he hoped Mamdani would be a “really great mayor” and felt “confident that he can do a very good job.”\n\nMeyers joked, “Normally the only time you see an old guy smile like that is when his favorite restaurant opens at four.”\n\nWitkoff’s phone call with Putin’s aide has sparked outrage, with some demanding he be relieved of his duties.\n\nRepublican representative Don Bacon was among them, writing on X, “For those who oppose the Russian invasion and want to see Ukraine prevail as a sovereign & democratic country, it is clear that Witkoff fully favors the Russians.”\n\n“He should be fired,” Bacon added.\n\nTed Lieu, a Democratic representative, went even further, calling Witkoff an “actual traitor,” on X.\n\nPennsylvania Republican Brian Fitzpatrick, meanwhile, said the Witkoff call was “a major problem,” and said that it was “one of the many reasons why these ridiculous side shows and secret meetings need to stop.”\n\nA full transcript of the conversation between the two depicts Witkoff providing details on exactly what to say to Trump ahead of a call with Putin.\n\n“My friend, I just want your advice,” Ushakov says. “Do you think that it will be useful if our bosses will talk on the phone? You do. And when you think it could be possible?”\n\nWitkoff then explained how the Russians can get the most out of Trump. \n\n“Yuri, Yuri, here’s what I would do. My recommendation. I would make the call and just reiterate that you congratulate the president on this achievement, that you supported it, you supported it, that you respect that he is a man of peace and you’re just, you’re really glad to have seen it happen. So I would say that. I think from that it’s going to be a really good call.”\n\nHe suggested what he called a “Trump plan,” outlining a path to peace in Ukraine. \n\n“Let me tell you what I told the president,” Witkoff continued. “I told the president that you—that the Russian Federation has always wanted a peace deal. That’s my belief. I told the president I believe that. And I believe the question is—the issue is is that we have two nations that are having a hard time coming to a compromise and when we do, we’re going to have a peace deal. \n\n“I’m even thinking that maybe we set out like a 20-point peace proposal, just like we did in Gaza. We put a 20-point Trump plan together that was 20 points for peace and I’m thinking maybe we do the same thing with you.”",

        "text": "Democratic New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said on Monday that he and President Donald Trump could not have had a more productive meeting during his visit to the White House.\n\nMamdani visited the White House on Friday and had a friendly meeting with the president about working together on the issues facing New York City. The mayor-elect said on “The Adam Friedland Show” that he had a long conversation with Trump about Roosevelt and the issues facing his city.\n\n“What was the weirdest thing he showed you? … He had to have shown you something, one thing weird,” Friedland asked.\n\n“I mean he showed me the portraits of all the presidents in the Cabinet Room. The FDR [portrait] was beautiful. It was really nice And we talked about FDR for a little bit. And honestly, you don’t have you don’t have the LaGuardia record if you don’t have FDR. Yeah, but we talked about that,” Mamdani said. (RELATED: Mamdani Claims It’s ‘Important’ He Still Views Trump As ‘Fascist,’ ‘Threat To Democracy’ After White House Meeting)\n\nMamdani added that they had “the most productive meeting” possible, since they discussed the costs of groceries, childcare, rent and other necessities that Americans are struggling to afford.\n\n“It honestly felt like the most productive meeting we could have had. I mean, a meeting where we talked about [Uniform Land Use Review Procedure], we talked about, you know, groceries, Con [Edison], rent, child care, that feels like the best meeting you can have,” Mamdani continued. \n\nTrump ensured that the meeting remained friendly while they spoke to the press. While Mamdani fumbled a question on whether he believes Trump is a fascist, the president chimed in and told him he could believe it.\n\nThe president also told reporters that he and Mamdani agree on several issues, including affordability and crime. Mamdani added that New Yorkers who voted for Trump told him that the cost of living was their biggest concern and he looks forward to partnering with the president to bring down costs.\n\nThe two leaders had repeatedly attacked one another publicly, as Mamdani named his campaign tour, “The Five Boroughs Against Trump,” to run in opposition to his agenda. Trump repeatedly referred to Mamdani as a “communist” and even threatened to arrest him if he followed through with his threats to interfere with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations.\n\nMamdani has promised to implement a $30 minimum wage, rent freezes and government-run grocery stores and buses. In 2021, he said during a Young Democratic Socialists of America conference that the goal of socialism is to “seize the means of production.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

        "text": "From President Donald Trump's triumphant return to the White House to the shocking assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, the last 12 months have been a whirlwind of stunning political and cultural moments. Fox News fans gathered once again on Long Island for a buzzworthy awards ceremony and had plenty to say about some of the top headlines of 2025. Fox Nation's seventh annual Patriot Awards, hosted by Sean Hannity, were held earlier this month at the Tilles Center in Greenvale, New York. Attendees dressed up in their formal and patriotic attire to take part in festivities with their favorite Fox News personalities and later tuned into the awards ceremony, which honored everyday Americans for their heroism and country pride. They also sounded off on several hot-button issues of 2025, including Kirk's murder, with Fox News Digital. JASON ALDEAN PERFORMS NEW SINGLE AT PATRIOT AWARDS, ANNOUNCES UPCOMING ALBUM RELEASE DATE The influential conservative commentator was killed earlier this year at Utah Valley University during one of his public speaking events. \"He was the definition of a patriot,\" a young male guest told the outlet at the event. \"That's what he did every day, that was what he was trying to do.\" One female attendee expressed her disappointment that the tragic shooting of Kirk may have caused further divisions amongst Americans. \"After Charlie Kirk's assassination, seeing how divided some people were about it was very hurtful, because it was just a moment that I thought more of the country would come together,\" she said. \"And so, seeing the other side, their reaction was, you know, in my opinion, not very patriotic.\" FOX NATION TO DEBUT EXCLUSIVE SPECIALS ON CHARLIE KIRK WITH NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN FOOTAGE Another young woman emphasized Kirk's killing as a sign for people to reveal their political beliefs openly. \"I think seeing something like that really just reiterated to our generation — to tons of generations — that it's important to hold true to what you believe in and to speak on what's important, and that nobody should ever be able to silence you just because of a difference of opinion,\" she explained. MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR ASSASSINATED TURNING POINT USA FOUNDER CHARLIE KIRK DRAWS TRUMP, MAJOR GOP FIGURES In discussing other hot topics with Patriot Awards attendees, some revealed what being a patriot meant to them. One guest said it meant putting \"America first,\" and standing up for veterans. Another said a patriot is simply \"someone that is proud of this country.\" One man pointed to an example of unpatriotic behavior, accusing Democrats of not showing enough pride for the United States of America. \"Everything the Democrats do is not patriotic,\" he said. \"They hate America — and the people on the extreme left are total America haters.\" Some Patriot Award attendees expressed dismay at New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's victory. The subject of a self-described socialist Democrat drew ire from a retired NYPD officer, who said, \"I'm glad I'm not there now, just let me tell you that.\" One man revealed his bleak outlook of the Big Apple due to Mamdani's victory, but said he remained optimistic of its future. \"I feel so sad for New York — it's my hometown, I grew up there,\" he said. \"But maybe it needs to go through some growing pains to learn what true conservatism is.\" CLICK HERE TO JOIN FOX NATION Those who missed the live-streaming of the Patriot Awards on Fox Nation can watch the re-air at 8 p.m. ET this Thanksgiving on Fox News Channel.

        "text": "That most venerable of far-left rags, The Nation, led the way with a hitherto unnoticed reason for why all decent people should abhor Thanksgiving Day. It seems that (as per the title of one article) “The Pilgrims Were Doomsday Cultists.” That’s right, and they were proto-MAGA fascists, too: “The settlers who arrived in Plymouth were not escaping religious persecution. They left on the Mayflower to establish a theocracy in the Americas.” You know, just like those “Christian nationalists” who want to replace the U.S. Constitution with the Bible, the ones whom the left is always so eager to warn about them, but who are actually so thin on the ground.\n\nAnd so what we need to do, The Nation tells us, is “Make Thanksgiving Radical Again.” As it turns out, you see, “the holiday’s real roots lie in abolition, liberation, and anti-racism. Let’s reconnect to that legacy.”\n\nUh huh. Actually, this isn’t difficult, and there is no need to overcomplicate it. The real roots of a holiday called “Thanksgiving” lie in giving thanks. But that is a posture that the left rejects utterly. Leftism in all its forms, from whatever the ideology of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer is to outright Maoism, is about a forthright and unapologetic rejection of the impulse to be grateful for anything.\n\nAs PJM’s C. A. Skeet explained Tuesday, “resentful, bitter people will never be thankful for anything. And they’re downright offended that we celebrate this holiday, the entire purpose of which is to humbly express gratitude for what we have been given. It flies in the face of their entire worldview.” Indeed. Leftism is the politics of rejecting being grateful. \n\nConsider, for example, the left’s oft-repeated promise that they will “make the rich pay their fair share” in taxes. The unspoken assumption is that they aren’t doing so already, and that the non-rich have a right to confiscate their wealth, which is assumed to be ill-gotten. New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and his fellow “democratic socialists” like to rail against “billionaires,” portraying them as a shadowy gang of plutocrats intent on bleeding ordinary folks dry. \n\n“A handful of millionaires and billionaires insolently dominate and the entire nation is in bondage,” said a prominent leftist. It could have been Mamdani or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Bernie Sanders, but it was actually V. I. Lenin, founder of the Soviet Union. Leftism from its mild to its virulent forms is essentially the same. We have to envy and hate the rich. We have to give them a taste of their own medicine, and bleed them dry instead. That’s socialism, that’s leftism, that’s the politics of envy and hatred. And the envious and hateful are by definition not grateful.\n\nIt’s Not Pride Month, It’s Envy Month\n\nAnd so the left, ungrateful in its very nature and at the core of its being, must try to remake Thanksgiving in its own image. It’s not really about giving thanks, you see. The people who first set aside a day to give thanks were dangerous religious fanatics, and even “doomsday cultists” (and this from people who constantly side with and make excuses for the real doomsday cultists who run the Islamic Republic of Iran). It’s really about “abolition, liberation, and anti-racism,” which is the left’s way of saying that it’s about harnessing the power of resentment in order to gain and hold political power. \n\nThat’s why the left hates Thanksgiving, and why leftists can and will never do anything but hate Thanksgiving and try to eradicate it. It’s all an exercise in white supremacism and settler colonialism, anyway. But above all, it must be destroyed because it encourages people to do what absolutely kills the entire leftist enterprise: give thanks.",

        "text": "Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu should be quaking in his boots at the decisive victory of Zohran Mamdani in the 4 November New York City mayoral election. Not because of absurd allegations of antisemitism for which there is no evidence, but because Mamdani has broken the longstanding taboo for successful New York candidates against criticizing the Israeli government. And he has only reinforced his approach in the month since his election.\n\nNew York has the largest Jewish population in the United States – and the second-largest of any city in the world after Tel Aviv. The longstanding assumption was that many Jewish voters prioritized the defense of the Israeli government over other issues, so criticism of Israel would set them against a politician.\n\nMamdani blew that assumption out of the water. During the campaign he spoke accurately and openly about the genocide that Israel was committing in Gaza. He insisted that all residents of Israel should have equal rights. He said he would arrest Netanyahu were he to show up in New York. Yet one-third of New York’s Jewish voters cast a ballot for him. As did many others.\n\nSome Jews may have been uncomfortable with Mamdani’s criticism of Israel but liked other aspects of his candidacy, such as his relentless focus on affordability. Others, myself included, were attracted by his candor on such an important issue as Israel. Many were also probably appalled by the efforts of Mamdani’s principal opponent, Andrew Cuomo, to tar Mamdani with fact-free allegations of antisemitism.\n\nMamdani has only continued his openness on Israel since the election. In his remarkably friendly meeting with Donald Trump in the White House on 21 November, Mamdani repeated his genocide views and noted that the US government was funding it. Trump let the comment slide without a response.\n\nAfter a major Manhattan synagogue hosted a group that was encouraging American Jews to emigrate not only to Israel (a normal enough appeal) but also to Israel’s settlements in the occupied West Bank, Mamdani noted the illegality of the settlements. That is an accurate reflection of article 49 of the fourth Geneva convention, which prohibits an occupying power from transferring its population to occupied territory.\n\nIt is hard to overstate how unusual such comments are on the part of a successful New York City candidate.\n\nIt is not as if New York candidates never criticize Israel. In March 2024, Chuck Schumer, the Jewish Senate minority leader from Queens who represents New York state, gave a much commented-upon speech in which he said that although Israel has a right to defend itself, it must do so while minimizing harm to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. But his language was carefully couched – tame compared to Mamdani’s – and he refused to endorse Mamdani, even after he won the Democratic mayoral primary.\n\nAlready Mamdani is attracting other progressive candidates to New York City congressional contests who are willing to criticize Israel and challenging those who don’t. By all appearances, he has broken the ice and started a trend.\n\nWe shouldn’t equate New York with the US at large. It is a solidly Democratic, extraordinarily progressive city. More to the point, my experience as a longtime resident is that much of its Jewish population shares that progressivism. As I have traveled around the United States, I have noticed that smaller Jewish populations are more likely to see themselves as a vulnerable minority and hence to back Israel as a potential haven from persecution. In New York, Judaism is part of the fabric of the city. The sense of security that being a New York Jew engenders is more likely to yield an openness to honest criticism of the Israeli government.\n\nThe political shift on Israel that Mamdani’s victory represents should be a wake-up call for the Netanyahu government. Its genocidal conduct in Gaza has turned Israel into a pariah state in much of the world. Even Germany briefly suspended the sale of arms that could be used in Gaza. Britain, Canada, France and Australia recognized a Palestinian state. Israel has been charged with genocide before the international court of justice, and Netanyahu and his former defense minister face war-crime charges before the international criminal court for starving and depriving Palestinian civilians. Israel today is overwhelming dependent on the military aid, arms sales, and diplomatic support of one country: the United States.\n\nThat means Trump. And he reads the polls. He must see that Aipac, the reflexively pro-Israel lobby, can no longer corral Jewish votes as it once did. He must see that even his Christian evangelical base – traditionally the most reliably pro-Israel votes – is having qualms after Israel’s atrocities in Gaza.\n\nIsrael’s growing unpopularity in the United States seems to be part of why Trump felt free to impose his 20-point peace plan on Netanyahu despite its failure to accede to his maximalist demands. The diminishing esteem for Israel will undoubtedly play a role again as Trump decides whether to insist on a clear pathway to a Palestinian state, as Arab leaders want. Trump will depend on them to fund Gaza’s reconstruction and to provide an international stabilization force for the territory.\n\nThat support for Israel is no longer de rigueur in New York could come to mean that it is no longer obligatory in Washington either. That is good news for the rights of Palestinians. But it is bad news for the hopes of Netanyahu and his far-right allies that the US government will endlessly close its eyes as the Israeli government attempts to “solve” the Palestinian conflict through the use of genocide, forced mass deportation, or endless apartheid.\n\n Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs.

However, there is another pandemic lurking behind and driving the racism pandemic — the Whiteness Pandemic. Whiteness refers to culture, not biology: the centuries-old culture of Whiteness features colorblindness, passivity, and White fragility, which are all covert expressions of racism common in the United States. Naming the Whiteness Pandemic shifts our gaze from the victims and effects of racism onto the systems that perpetrate and perpetuate racism, starting with the family system. At birth, young children growing up in White families begin to be socialized into the culture of Whiteness, making the family system one of the most powerful systems involved in systemic racism.\n\nMany of you readers are gathering with, or will be gathering, your families today and through the end of the year. The UMN thinks such relationships are contributing to systemic racism.\n\nOf course, the only solution to this \"problem\" is the dismantling of the family system. Socialists, of course, hate the family and always have. In New York, Zohran Mamdani's Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) backers have made the abolition of the family a plank in their platform, and for many of the same reasons.

IN TODAY’S NEWSLETTER: - IDF finds 4.5-mile Hamas tunnel under UN compound- FBI was onto CAIR long before Texas branded it ‘terror organization’- Speaker Mike Johnson calls out antisemitism, says Israel-US relations crucial TOP STORY: The IDF revealed a seven-kilometer, 25-meter-deep Hamas \"root tunnel\" under Rafah with 80 rooms used for command, weapons and shelter. Originating beneath an UNRWA compound, it fed other tunnels and allegedly held Lt. Hadar Goldin. Israel says its destruction is a major strategic blow as it targets Hamas’s vast underground network. VIDEO: Outgoing New York City Mayor Eric Adams warns that the city's Jews face a tough environment under the leadership of incoming Mayor Zohran Mamdani. WATCH HERE: G-MEN KNEW: The FBI restricted non-investigative contact with CAIR starting in 2008 after evidence linked its leaders to Hamas. A 2013 DOJ inspector general report found repeated violations of the ban and poor oversight. The revived findings follow Texas labeling CAIR a terrorist group, as federal lawmakers debate action against Islamist networks. REJECTING HATE: House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the U.S.–Israel alliance as vital and urged universal rejection of antisemitism. He acknowledged GOP divisions but stressed Israel’s strategic and democratic importance. As some Republicans like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie break from traditional pro-Israel positions, Johnson emphasized unity, morality and support for the Jewish community. GUEST EDITORIAL: Heather Johnston, founder of the U.S. Israel Education Association, a nonpartisan organization that promotes dialogue and cooperation between the U.S. and Israel, writes that it is crucial for Christians to stand with Israel amid rising antisemitism. \"Antisemitism is not just an attack on Jews,\" writes Johnston. \"It is an attack on the very foundation of our Christian identity.\" QUOTE OF THE WEEK: \"You can make all sorts of arguments of why this is a really important friendship and alliance. But the antisemitism stuff ought to be universally rejected and called out. And I'm very insistent about that.\" House Speaker Mike Johnson on Israel-US relations. - Looking for more on this topic?

        "text": "One of the unhappiest places in New York City during President Donald Trump's and Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's White House lovefest last week was the Consolidated Edison Building.\n\nTwo of America’s best-known political leaders — who are diametrically opposed on nearly everything — announced to the world that they found common ground in demanding the city utility giant bring its rates down.\n\n“We've gotten fuel prices way down, but it hasn't shown up in Con Edison,” the president said. “ We have to get Con Edison to start lowering the rates.”\n\nMamdani concurred: \"Absolutely.\"\n\nBut before the world’s two most influential New Yorkers met that day, Con Ed had already won approval from New York state to boost its rates, starting in 2026.\n\nFor electricity customers, rates will go up by 3.5% 2026, 3.2% for 2027 and 3.1% for 2028, according to a summary of the agreement between Con Ed and the state. For New York City residents, this adds up to about a $4 monthly increase next year.\n\nGas rates will go up by 4.4% next year, 5.7% in 2027 and 5.6% in 2028. Next year’s monthly bills will see an average increase of $10.67. In the second year, bills will go up by another $14.38, and in 2028 customers will have to pay $15.08 more every month.\n\nStill, that’s significantly less than Con Ed had asked for when it filed its new rate case with the Public Service Commission in January. The original proposal for a one-time hike to take effect in 2026 would have raised gas bills by an average of roughly 13% or $46.42 per month. Electric bills would have increased by about 19% or an additional $26.60 per month.\n\nAfter receiving a record 20,000 public comments on the rate-hike requests — mostly in opposition — Con Ed and the Public Service Commission lowered the request for additional gas revenue by about 60% and by about 34% for electricity.\n\n“We recognize affordability is a critical issue and work every day to balance the investments needed for resilience and reliability with customer costs,” Con Ed spokesperson Jamie McShane said immediately after the White House meeting last week. “We welcome the opportunity to partner with the mayor-elect on solutions that make New York affordable for everyone.”\n\nWhile advocates fought for no increases in energy bills, many groups supported the new rates when they were announced earlier this month, including the Alliance for a Green Economy, the City of New York, the New York Power Authority and Amtrak.\n\nBut New Yorkers, who have seen supply costs increase substantially over the last year, voiced outrage in their comments.\n\n“If you increase rates any more, I will not be able to have electricity at all. I will burn up during the summer; freeze in the winter and work by candlelight, you greedy a-- backwards sorry excuse for a company,” Lauren Boudreau wrote in the public comments. “Do you want an angry mob on your hands? This is how you get one.”\n\nSince 2022, monthly Con Ed gas bills have risen around $50, according to an analysis by Alliance for a Green Economy — all while profits rose by roughly 66% over the last decade. A state-guaranteed return on equity for Con Ed investors is baked into every customer's bill. That system tends to reward capital expenditures.\n\nAccording to Con Ed’s original gas case filings, the utility's largest capital expenditure is related to new gas hookups. Ratepayers collectively pay when new gas customers are connected to the gas system.\n\nDuring the last legislative session, state lawmakers repealed the \"100-foot rule\" where utilities say gas hookups are \"free\" if a space is within 100 feet of a pipeline. But cost is simply passed on to all ratepayers to the tune of about $200 million a year, according to the New York League of Conservation Voters.\n\nThe repeal bill, which Con Ed opposed when it was passed in June, is still waiting for Gov. Kathy Hochul's signature. The governor's office responded that it will review the legislation.\n\nOther expenses are tied to replacing leak-prone pipes and maintaining the aging gas system, which is due for retirement by the end of the next decade under the state climate law.\n\n”It's not that the cost of gas is going up, it's just that we're all paying for the extra infrastructure,” said Kim Fraczek, director of Sane Energy Project. “The governor is really saddling Con Edison customers with really hefty rate hikes just because she won't sign the 100-foot rule into law.\"\n\nAccording to the city comptroller’s office, about 30% of residents cannot afford their energy bills. In the last five years, approximately 3.5 million households have been behind on bills. Nearly one-quarter of households have had their power cut.\n\n“The utility bills are already incredibly high especially in summer and winter when it’s needed most,” wrote Astoria customer Eli Lind. “This is not an optional expense. Between utilities, rent and groceries, the non-negotiable cost of living is putting a strain on incomes and pushing people out.”",

There is an international movement to boycott, sanction, and divest from Israel, but in the United States, President Donald Trump is imperiling the freedom even to publicly discuss such ideas, which should, in effect, be considered a test case for his larger attack on free speech. So far, the test is going well for Trump.\n\nIn what seems a long time ago, in 2024, the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think tank, released a blueprint for what it called “a national strategy to combat antisemitism” by addressing what it described as “America’s virulently anti-Israel, anti-Zionist, and anti-American ‘pro-Palestinian movement.’” In essence, and in what’s amounted to an extraordinarily effective work of political theater that has been sold to my own state, Massachusetts, among other places, that foundation dubbed its political opponents “supporters of terrorism.” It also labeled organizations working in opposition to its agenda a “terrorist support network,” and claimed for itself the noble mantle of “combating antisemitism” — even as it deftly redefined antisemitism from hatred of Jewish people to criticism of the U.S.-Israel alliance. President Trump has put the Heritage Foundation strategy into action and gone even further.\n\nIt may be his most original idea. As political scientist Barnett Rubin put it in September, “President Trump always says he’s very creative and accomplishes things no one has ever done before. And now he is building a fascist regime which is legitimized by the fight against antisemitism. Nobody ever thought of doing that before.”\n\nHow the Defense Department (Oops, Sorry, the War Department) Promotes World Peace\n\nI attended Hebrew school as a child, and today, when I try to recall what I learned there about Israel and Palestine, I find in my memory an image of a desert, replete with flowers, and the pleasant recollection that the State of Israel was founded in that empty landscape. In 1998, I visited Israel with my family. My brother had his bar mitzvah at the mountain-top fortress of Masada overlooking the Dead Sea. Though I enjoyed an enviable private school education, I didn’t hear the word Nakba until adulthood. That Arabic word for catastrophe refers to the displacement of 700,000 Palestinian people for Israel’s founding in 1948. A majority of the population of the modern-day Gaza Strip descended from refugees of the Nakba.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International and the Israeli human rights organization B’Tselem, Israel has imposed a system of oppression on Palestinians across Israel and in the Occupied Palestinian Territories through an enforced system of segregation that constitutes apartheid. For decades, Israel has controlled who could enter or exit the Gaza Strip and, from 2007 on, that 25-mile strip of land functioned as what Human Rights Watch called an “open-air prison.” As of 2022, the unemployment rate in Gaza had hit 45%, and 65% of the people there were living in poverty. On October 7th of the following year, an armed group broke out of Gaza and waged attacks on Israel that killed 1,195 people, 815 of whom were civilians.\n\nIn the two years since then, Israel has responded by killing more than 67,000 Palestinians in Gaza in a military campaign of such horror that, as the head of Doctors Without Borders reported to the U.N. Security Council, children as young as five said that they preferred to die rather than continue living in fear while witnessing the slaughter of their family members. A girl named Sham was born in Gaza in November 2023 and survived smoke poisoning as an infant. As a toddler, she was diagnosed with acute malnutrition, before being killed on May 6th of this year when Israel dropped explosives on the shelter where she was living with her family. The United Nations and prominent experts, including Israeli-American professor of Holocaust and genocide studies Omer Bartov, have concluded that Israel’s war on Gaza is a genocide. The current ceasefire has slowed, not stopped, the death toll.\n\nBy 2024, the International Court of Justice, the world’s highest court, had ruled that Israel’s occupation of Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem was illegal; that Israel needed to halt all settlement construction, evacuate its settlers, pay restitution to Palestinians, and allow them the right of return. It also indicated that all states and international organizations have a legal obligation not to assist Israel’s further occupation of the area.\n\nHowever, since October 2023, according to the Israeli Defense Ministry and the Council on Foreign Relations, using 800 transport planes and 140 ships, my own country has delivered 90,000 tons of arms and equipment to Israel, including tanks, artillery shells, bombs, and rockets. The U.S. government gives Israel billions of dollars annually in military aid, which that country spends mostly on purchases made through the U.S. “Foreign Military Sales” program. According to a Defense Department website, that program sells “articles and services [that] will strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace.”\n\nDespite how, as Israeli historian Lee Mordechai described it, Israel has limited the flow of information out of Gaza and campaigned to discredit critical voices, a July Gallup poll found that 60% of Americans disapprove of Israel’s military actions there. Even more strikingly, a September Washington Post poll found that nearly half (48%) of Jewish Americans disapprove (and only 46% approve).\n\nBut according to recommendations issued by the Massachusetts Special Commission on Combating Antisemitism, a group created by state law in 2024, a teacher discussing such polling in a classroom could precipitate an anonymous complaint filed with the state police on the grounds that the educator has rendered the learning environment in my state hostile to Jewish students.\n\nSchool Teachers Are the Problem!\n\nLast February, Special Commission co-chair and State Representative Simon Cataldo conducted an inquisition — yes, an inquisition — into the president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association (who is himself Jewish), including presenting a series of materials on Israel/Palestine that Cataldo had obtained from a database of educator resources. He displayed a graphic called “Born Unequal Abroad,” which lists the different rights afforded to an American Jewish child and the child of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. The former can visit Israel and even become an Israeli citizen at any time, while the latter is barred from visiting and has no pathway to citizenship (even through marriage). Cataldo seemed to regard that graphic (and others like it) as self-evidently antisemitic and displayed it as a smoking gun that revealed the supposed antisemitism festering within the Massachusetts Teachers Association.\n\nIn other words, in my home state today, “combating antisemitism” means a governor- and legislature-appointed commission conducting an inquisition of a (Jewish) union leader for the offense of failing to suppress critical discussion of a foreign nation that the world’s leading human rights organizations have found to be upholding a system of apartheid and committing genocide. At the same time, actual antisemitism — that is, the hatred of Jewish people by xenophobic nationalists — has gone largely unexamined by the Commission in the midst of its campaign to shut down criticism of Israel. (I imagine President Trump and the Heritage Foundation applauding in the background.)\n\nIndeed, over the course of a year of hearings, the Special Commission has perhaps irreparably merged the concept of antisemitism with criticism of Israel, which seems to have been the point. State Senator and Commission Co-Chair John Velis actually uses the terms “anti-Israel” and “antisemitic” interchangeably, though they do have different meanings and anyone charged with the responsibility of leading a state panel on antisemitism should know that. Velis, who is not Jewish, has taken multiple trips to Israel paid for by the Israeli government as well as a charity affiliated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the lobby group known as AIPAC.\n\nThe Special Commission has unveiled recommendations for Massachusetts schools that include utilizing a definition of antisemitism that, according to the ACLU, will have the effect of chilling free speech. It has also recommended launching a statewide reporting system in which anonymous allegations of antisemitism in schools would be collected by the state police.\n\nFollowing the initial release of those recommendations, Governor Maura Healey issued a statement applauding the Commission’s work. Organizations like the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Boston have also sent out emails to their membership commending the Commission.\n\nPerhaps in response to the hours of dissenting public testimony that (mostly Jewish) people as well as scholars and education experts have offered, the commissioners wrote in their most recent report, “We should listen to and respect people who say that they have been harmed by antisemitism; we should not gaslight them or tell them that their experience is invalid.”\n\nWho could argue?\n\nA Federal Judge Weighs In\n\nAfter Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk was abducted from the street by ICE agents for the offense of co-writing an op-ed in the school paper asking the school to divest from companies with ties to Israel, a federal judge found that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem had violated the First Amendment through a policy of targeting for deportation noncitizens who criticized Israel or voiced support for Palestinians. The judge also found that executive orders issued by President Trump had relied on a definition of antisemitism that encompassed First Amendment-protected speech (the same definition recommended by the Massachusetts Commission!).\n\nBut will that federal court ruling even matter? According to the same judge, “The effect of these targeted deportation proceedings continues unconstitutionally to chill freedom of speech to this day.”\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning author Benjamin Moser has noted that, after October 7th, some American Jewish institutions not only supported Israel’s reign of terror over Palestinian civilians but also applauded the clampdown on free speech in order to sustain the killing. “The younger generations, people who have seen with their own eyes the crimes of the so-called Jewish state, and who feel the sacrilege, the impious desecration, of the values they thought were Jewish,” he wrote, “will never return to these institutions.”\n\nBut will it matter? Surely, it won’t stop Donald Trump from using his version of Jewish identity as a moral shield for his attack on free speech.\n\nIn Massachusetts, a coalition of organizations has publicly opposed the Special Commission’s recommendations and, in the western part of the state where I live, a group of residents has resorted to putting out yard signs with QR codes on them to call attention to this travesty. I’m part of that effort, but does it matter?\n\nIn California, a new law, ostensibly intended to protect Jewish students from discrimination, goes into effect on January 1st. It has, however, put educators on alert that they may be accused of antisemitism if they share information deemed critical of Israel.\n\nMeanwhile, the leaders of civil society organizations appear ill-suited to resist such suppression of free speech and, in some cases, seem to embrace it. In January, members of the American Historical Association voted 428 to 88 in favor of declaring their opposition to “scholasticide” (the deliberate destruction of an education system) in Gaza. But the Association’s leadership council vetoed that vote. A similar episode occurred at the Modern Language Association.\n\nAmy Hagopian, a professor emeritus of global health at the University of Washington, who for years taught a class on war and health, recently wrote about how she was expelled from the American Public Health Association after publicly protesting a decision by its executive board to halt consideration of a resolution on Palestinian health justice. (An anonymous complaint had alleged that the protest was antisemitic.)\n\nAn Alternative Could Look Like This\n\nThe usual line-toeing of politicians in both major parties has involved reciting statements of support for Israel, whatever it does. By contrast, Zohran Mamdani was clear during his victorious campaign to become mayor of New York City that he supports an end to apartheid for Palestinians and opposes the crimes against humanity committed by Israel. In American politics, that represented a fresh playbook. He focused successfully on his city’s absurdly high cost of living and did so as part of a coalition that included people of the Jewish faith and other faiths, even as powerful moneyed interests lined up against him. And he won.\n\nKeep in mind that a clear majority of Americans do indeed disapprove of Israel’s actions in Gaza, so it makes sense that there was an electorate for a candidate who would tell the truth about the oppression of Palestinians, while rejecting claims that it’s antisemitic to do so. Mamdani won a third of voters who specified Judaism as their religion (just as he won a third of Catholics). He also overwhelmingly won among those with no religious affiliation (a quarter of the electorate) and those whose religious affiliation was described as “Other,” which is where exit pollsters put people who are Muslim.\n\nTrump’s urge to suppress free speech may be about Israel today, but count on one thing: it will be about something else tomorrow. The real question is whether Americans will accept his violations of the First Amendment or fight to protect free speech even when they dislike things other people have to say.\n\nCopyright 2025 Mattea Kramer\n\nMattea Kramer, a TomDispatch regular, is the author of the award-winning novel The Untended about capitalism and the American opioid crisis.\n\nFollow TomDispatch on Twitter and join us on Facebook.

And thereby, without being fully aware, they begin to incarnate the national spirit.\n\nFIVE CLASSIC THANKSGIVING MOVIES AND SHOWS THAT CELEBRATE FAMILY\n\nIn personal terms, a disposition to be grateful renders important benefits, reducing anxiety and depression, and making us better companions and better sleepers. This is so self-evident that it hardly requires research to substantiate it, but the evidence does exist.\n\nIn geopolitics, the thankful disposition draws a bright line between the United States and wretched states officially devoted to its opposite, ungratefulness. A commitment to gratitude may have been one of the things — right up there with love of liberty — that made America the historic sworn enemy of Marxism, whose guiding ideology, envy, is the wages of ingratitude.\n\nThanksgiving is unquestionably uniquely American. I have lived at least a year in seven countries, in Asia, Europe, and the Americas, many more if one counts shorter stays, and have never encountered anything like it anywhere else.\n\nYes, in East Asia, I experienced firsthand what the Koreans call the Chuseok festival, held on the 15th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar, so from late September to early October, depending on the year. But it’s not dedicated to giving thanks, but rather to the full moon.\n\nCanada, Liberia, and the Caribbean island nation of Grenada also have official Thanksgiving days, but they are derivatives of America’s.\n\nThanksgiving is not just uniquely tied to this country because it is reflective of the American national character. Its lineage is the thread of the national quilt.\n\nAnyone who has watched A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, and its companion, The Mayflower Voyagers, will know the essentials of how the first Thanksgiving was celebrated by the Pilgrims and their Indian hosts in 1621 in the Plymouth Colony. Right there, Thanksgiving starts as a needed slap in the face to the “land acknowledgement” crowd.\n\n(And yes, it might be better to read a book and learn history right and not from Peanuts, but don’t underestimate the value of popular culture in propagandizing the national spirit. When Charlie Brown exclaims at the Thanksgiving table, “We thank the Lord for a bountiful harvest,” Hollywood was telling generations of young Americans that it wasn’t just ok to be patriotic and faithful, but that it was normal and expected.)\n\nThen, in one of its very first acts, the first Congress in 1789 requested that the newly elected President Washington proclaim a national day of Thanksgiving.\n\nBut it wasn’t until later, in the middle of the Civil War and in response to a persistent, decadeslong letter-writing campaign by editor and writer Sarah Josepha Hale, that Abraham Lincoln in 1863 proclaimed the last Thursday in November as our official day of Thanksgiving. Then, just as America was about to enter another war, Congress officially made it the fourth Thursday in 1941.\n\nThus, Congress and our most important leaders ratified an outlook that is the gift that keeps on giving.\n\nExperiencing gratitude is “associated with greater longevity among older adults,” says a Harvard study from last year. According to the British Psychological Society, “around 18.5 per cent of individual differences in people’s happiness could be predicted by the amount of gratitude they feel.”\n\nSaying thanks to your partner and meaning it also makes the institution of marriage stronger. A team at the University of Illinois found that “higher levels of perceived gratitude buffered against the stresses of both financial strain and ineffective arguing.” (One could ask, in marriage, is there any other type of arguing?)\n\nMeanwhile, at UC Berkeley, a 2009 study found that “Gratitude was uniquely related to total sleep quality, subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, and daytime dysfunction.”\n\nBEDFORD SPRINGS DELIGHTS WITH SMALL-TOWN CHRISTMAS CHARM\n\nOf course, Presidents Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt, and the various congresses in question — to say nothing of the Pilgrim fathers, Samoset, or Squanto — did not have any of these benefits in mind; they just wanted to thank the Lord. Maybe the unintended consequences are payback.\n\nOf course, that is not going to help you deal with your aunt who voted for Kamala Harris and will show up dressed in a Handmaid’s Tale outfit. Just tell her that if President Donald Trump and Zohran Mamdani can bury the hatchet, she can get along with others, too.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving.\n\nMike Gonzalez is the Angeles T.

        "text": "Zohran Mamdani, the incoming Mayor of New York City has had a volatile relationship with President Trump. He's called the president a fascist. Trump, in return, has called him a \"little communist mayor,\" and warned that he may send in the National Guard. The administration also said it will expand ICE operations in the city.\n\nBut when the two leaders finally met face to face recently it was, to many people's surprise, cordial. Some may even say warm.\n\n\"We agree on a lot more than I would have thought. I want him to do a great job, and we'll help him do a great job,\" the president said. Soon the internet was flooded with memes of the president looking admiringly up at Mamdani. The next day's New York Post cover read \"I love you Mam.\"\n\nBut many New Yorkers say they're taking it all with a grain of salt and remaining on guard.\n\n\"The president says one thing one day, and a different thing the next,\" says one street vendor outside the subway station in Queens. \"You don't know what's real anymore.\"\n\nWhat she does know is that she's seen an uptick in immigration enforcement recently, which is why she asked that NPR withhold her name. She's undocumented, and she's worried.\n\nEvery morning at around 4:30 a.m., she posts up here and sells refreshments and breakfast. A few weeks ago, a little after setting up, she says several ICE agents jumped out of an unmarked car in pursuit of two workers who'd just bought something to eat.\n\nShe ran into the building behind her, locked the door and hid in the stairway until it was all over.\n\nThis vendor says she loves Mamdani, but worries the president will punish the city for electing a democratic socialist. She fears New York will turn into Chicago or Los Angeles, two cities that have experienced large-scale immigration raids.\n\nThis is a common sentiment in New York these days. The day after the White House meeting, President Trump said that while he's not planning on sending troops into New York now, he would, if needed. NPR reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment and received no response.\n\nMamdani, for his part, reiterated he will defend immigrants in New York.\n\nHis team did not grant NPR an interview, despite multiple requests. But a source close to his transition team who spoke on condition of anonymity told NPR that Mamdani is exploring legal strategies at the local level to limit Trump's actions in New York City, including muscling up the NYC Law Department by adding 200 attorneys.\n\nCongressman Patrick Ryan of the Hudson Valley, a Democrat whose district includes some of New York City's northern suburbs, told NPR that one of the lessons from Chicago and LA is that states can successfully challenge the administration in court. Ryan cites his own background as an Iraq War veteran.\n\n\"To come home to my state and my country, and see the idea of U.S. troops deployed against U.S. citizens and American cities, it's so fundamentally un-American. It's also, by the way, not what young American men and women sign up to do,\" he says.\n\nHe hopes the meeting between Mamdani and Trump de-escalated tensions. But like the street vendor in Queens, he's taking it with a grain of salt. He's hoping for the best, he says, but preparing for the worst.\n\nWhich is what organizers on the streets are doing.\n\nCarina Kaufman-Gutierrez is the deputy director of the advocacy group Street Vendor Project. She says street vendors are among the most vulnerable immigrants in New York. \"Street Vendors are the eyes on the ground right? They see everything that happens.\"\n\nShe's hopeful that the incoming Mayor will be an ally. She says she's also confident New York street vendors are uniquely prepared to weather an ICE campaign. Many of them, she says, see this as \"the next pandemic.\"\n\nThe organization is, in fact, leaning in on pandemic-era strategies for vendors who are scared to work on the streets during immigration raids. \"We have a catering program for example, where people can reach out to us, and we'll connect them to a vendor for catering their event.\"\n\nShe says, something the new mayor could do is make it easier for street vendors to operate — which Mamdani has said he will prioritize. He has pledged to allow thousands of additional license applications for vendors, and repeal criminal liability rules.\n\nMeanwhile, in the cold shade of her stand, the breakfast street vendor looks out at the busy avenue. She wonders how long this liveliness will last, and how long she will endure.\n\n\"Three more years,\" she says, referring to the Trump administration. \"I hope they go by quickly.\"",

        "text": "Thanksgiving is twice blessed. It blesseth those who give and those who receive.\n\nIts origins trace back to 1621, more than four centuries ago, featuring the Plymouth colony, Pilgrims fleeing religious persecution, and the Wampanoag Native Americans who were present long before Columbus purported to discover America in 1492. It was a three-day gathering to celebrate a bountiful harvest and peace fortified by prayer.\n\nThe first Thanksgiving is a reminder of William Faulkner’s wisdom in “Requiem for a Nun”: “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.”\n\nWe continue to struggle with religious freedom. Antisemitism is rampant, spiked by Hamas’s murderous aggression against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, applauded by many anti-Zionists like New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. President Donald Trump recently deplored Nigeria’s “existential threat” to Christians. Buddhist Myanmar has been found guilty of genocide of the Muslim Rohingya by the International Court of Justice. This is but the tip of the iceberg of religious persecution globally that haunts the species.\n\nLet us pause to reflect on James Madison’s 1785 “Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments” saluting religious liberty as an unalienable natural right:\n\n“(W)e hold it for a fundamental and undeniable truth, ‘that Religion or the duty which we owe to our Creator and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence.’ The Religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man; and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate. This right is in its nature an unalienable right. It is unalienable, because the opinions of men, depending only on the evidence contemplated by their own minds cannot follow the dictates of other men: It is unalienable also, because what is here a right towards men, is a duty towards the Creator. It is the duty of every man to render to the Creator such homage and such only as he believes to be acceptable to him.”\n\nPeace with Native Americans did not long endure. Columbus sailed under the aegis of the doctrine of discovery, a 15th-century theory derived from papal bulls on behalf of European colonial powers that dispossessed indigenous people of ownership of the lands they occupied. The United States inherited the doctrine, which provoked chronic conflict and warfare. Consider one of the grievances against King George III penned in the American Declaration of Independence:\n\n“He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.”\n\nThe Trail of Tears, the Sand Creek Massacre, Wounded Knee and similar oppressions of Native Americans are a blight on American exceptionalism. They should humble us to our own shortcomings, and remind us of Matthew 7:3-5: “Why do you see the speck in your neighbor’s eye, but do not notice the log in your own eye?”\n\nLet us always be grateful that all of us have won lottery tickets. The probability of human existence in the Milky Way galaxy is infinitesimal. Be grateful for small things: food to eat, clothes to wear, a roof to sleep under, and friends to enjoy. Life is commonly a sum of trifles.\n\nUse suffering as a source of strength, not despair. Job’s immense losses were more than amply rewarded. The test of character is how you recover from defeat, not how you rejoice in triumph.\n\nAbraham Lincoln proclaimed Thanksgiving a national holiday on Oct. 3, 1863. He summoned us to make it our finest hour in displaying charity and goodwill toward all in our midst.\n\nI am in Israel this Thanksgiving, awed by a nation as much to be marveled at as imitated for perseverance and justice in housing God’s chosen people.\n\nUnsparing gratitude is our salvation.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving to all.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM",

Kathy Hochul. Childcare can cost as much as $26&comma;000 a year for an infant in a care center.Mamdani&apos;s campaign proposed universal childcare for kids 6 weeks to 5 years old. He is also planning to raise the wage for childcare workers to parity with public school teachers&comma; whose starting salary is $68&comma;902 with a bachelor&apos;s degree and no teaching experience.That would build on the city&apos;s existing universal 3-K and Pre-K programs for children aged 3 and 4&comma; respectively.

Mamdani hopes to tackle it with the help of the state. Universal childcare advocacy groups are excited about the newfound support for a universal system and are hopeful for the future.On the steps of New York City Hall&comma; the Empire State Campaign for Child Care (ESCCC)&comma; a statewide advocacy group for universal childcare&comma; unveiled its recommended plan for achieving universal childcare for the state.ESCCC hosted several speakers at its Thursday event&comma; including Elizabeth Kennedy&comma; a working parent of two and the deputy public advocate for Education & Opportunity at the Office of the New York City Public Advocate.\"We cannot do our jobs without the village&comma;\" she said in reference to the group&apos;s plan to raise childcare workers&apos; wages&comma; a workforce whose majority is immigrant workers and women of color.\"There&apos;s never been so much momentum behind childcare&comma;\" said State Sen.

        "text": "If Israel’s genocide in Gaza has been a site of tension in your family for the last two Thanksgiving holidays, this year should be no different. The so-called ceasefire might seem like a good excuse to bury the hatchet and enjoy a quieter turkey dinner, but when we look at the harrowing status quo for Palestinians in Gaza today, there is no peace to be thankful for — especially not on a day that marks the remembrance of this country’s own genocide against Indigenous Americans.\n\nTo be clear, if two years of livestreamed annihilation have failed to shift your loved ones’ support away from the Israeli ethnostate, I doubt there is anything a dinner table argument could do to persuade them. There can be no reasoning with a worldview that forecloses seeing Palestinians as fully human.\n\nI navigate this with pro-Israel members of my own British Jewish family. It’s painful, and I don’t have any good advice. Whatever your approach with your family, there can be no pretense that the genocide in Gaza is over.\n\nFamilies like mine, divided over Israel, are not the important ones here. For my part, I’ll be thinking instead of another family this Thanksgiving: that of my student from Gaza. He escaped in 2024 after Israel bombed his home, killing two of his immediate family members, including his mother. His surviving family are still there, living in tents. He hasn’t heard from them in over two weeks.\n\nIt is for families like my student’s that we cannot simply take it easy this Thanksgiving because of the so-called ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nUnending Destruction\n\nWhile the October 10 agreement has offered some relief for Palestinians, with a significant drop in daily slaughter, displacement, starvation and killings by Israeli forces continue. Instead of relentless, Israel’s bombings over the last 45 days have been simply ongoing and regular. Israel has killed 345 Palestinians in Gaza, including 120 children, while demolishing over 1,500 structures. \n\nAt the same time, only a fraction of the aid trucks which were supposed to enter Gaza daily under the ceasefire agreement have been permitted entry by Israeli forces. Mass, enforced hunger continues in the Strip, where 50 million tons of rubble sits atop well over 10,000 unrecovered bodies.\n\nIn the face of such totalizing and unending destruction, it’s hard to find much solace in the fact that the support for the Palestinian cause has grown internationally; that nearly all major international human rights organizations have recognized Israel’s actions as genocidal; that a major wave of nation-states, including France, Canada, and Britain, moved this year to recognize the state of Palestine. The dead, displaced, and occupied can do little with declarations that carry no concrete consequences.\n\n“What we need is a justice plan,” Mosab Abu Toha, the Palestinian writer and poet, told a U.N. meeting this week. “It is time to stop accepting the illusion of peace processes that only entrench injustices.”\n\nWith the state of the world as it stands, it feels unlikely that Israeli leaders will be held accountable for their war crimes any time soon. Justice for Palestine is hard to imagine, but we can continue to apply pressure in ways that have already seen paradigms shift. Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York City mayoral election was a genuine victory against the perverse weaponization of antisemitism against Israel’s critics. Now New Yorkers must push our next mayor to uphold commitments to Palestinian solidarity and international law.\n\nAnd there is more those of us living in safety can do. We can send funds and share resources, as so many already do. And we can continue heading and supporting Palestinians’ call for boycotts, divestment, and sanctions against Israeli institutions complicit in occupation and apartheid.\n\nActivist sometimes say, “Solidarity begins at home.” Yet not everyone can choose their home. If you have the great fortune of spending the holidays with loved ones who share your commitments to justice and liberation, I hope your time together is full of joy. Most of the time, though, solidarity actually begins anywhere but home. So if you choose to spend time with your family knowing that it will be fraught, I wish you luck. The weekend will pass, and there’s urgent work to be done.",

The pair of Democrat progressives would rather “stand up” to Trump — and appease their left-wing base — than work with him to benefit their larger constituencies, meaning the city and the state.\n\nWu, in fact, arrogantly insists that she has no interest in a “bromance” with Trump.\n\nIn one-party Democratic Massachusetts, politics beats policy every time. And the politics call for Democratic office holders to hurl hate bombs against Trump no matter the consequences.\n\nWhat will they do when Trump is gone?\n\nMamdani, the brash 34-year-old mayor-elect of New York City, and a Democratic Socialist to boot, threw the same hate bombs at Trump in his campaign for mayor.\n\nHe called Trump everything from a fascist to a despot.\n\n“We will put an end to the culture of corruption that has allowed billionaires like Trump to evade taxation and exploit tax breaks,” Mamdani said in his belligerent victory speech.\n\nTrump, not to be outdone in the insult department, called Mamdani, among other things, “a nut job” and a “lunatic” communist. He would have labeled him “Moscow Mamdani” had he thought of it.\n\nBut a funny thing happened that changed everything.\n\nMamdani was elected.\n\nHe then realized that he needed help to run the biggest city in the country and keep people safe.\n\nSo, after brutally attacking the New York police, he first asked Jessica Tisch, the effective law-and-order police commissioner, to stay on the job and promised to keep the number of cops at their present level.\n\nThen Mamdani realized that he needed help to pay for all the free stuff he, like a true socialist, promised, things like free day care, free buses, city-run grocery stores, and so on.\n\nBut, instead of reaching out to other Democratic Socialists, like Sen. Bernie Sanders or Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for instance, who offer nothing but socialist platitudes, he reached out to Republican President Donald Trump, the capitalist who can do things for him and for New York.\n\nIt was a shrewd maneuver on his part, and for Trump as well. Three months ago, nobody knew who Mamdani was, and here he was in the White House meeting with the most powerful man in the world.\n\nThe socialist had come hat in hand asking the capitalist for help.\n\nThe key to the success of the meeting was that the pair discussed what they could agree on — helping New York on affordability issues — while ignoring what they differed on, like ICE rounding up criminal illegal immigrants, law and order, Israel, protecting Jews in New York, and Mamdani’s refusal to condemn the Intifada.\n\nWhile Mamdani stood by a seated Trump, like pupil and teacher, Trump said, “Some of his ideas are really the same ideas that I have.”\n\n“We’re going to be helping him to make everybody’s dream come true, having a strong and very safe New York,” Trump said.\n\nWhile Mamdani faces criticism from militant Trump-hating socialists for cozying up to Trump, it was a bold move on his part. Mamdani put the policy of helping New York over the politics of hating Trump.\n\nOthers should follow suit.\n\nVeteran political reporter Peter Lucas can be reached at: peter.lucas@bostonherald.com.",

        "text": "New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s smile carried him a long way toward being elected. And he used his affability again on Friday, turning the meeting he had requested with President Donald Trump into an Oval Office lovefest.\n\nNow it’s time for the mayor-elect to employ the power of smiling to make day-to-day life better for New Yorkers when they are compelled to interact with city employees. Mamdani needs to call on the 300,000 city employees to show warmth, respect and courtesy to the public. The spirit of a smile.\n\nWalk into a city agency or court building seeking help, and you’re likely to get barked at and herded like a dumb animal. Ask a Metropolitan Transportation Authority employee why the train isn’t coming, and you’re apt to hear, “Can’t you read the sign?” followed by a muttered “dumb f**k.” It’s a bruising experience.\n\nI went to family court at 111 Centre Street last Thursday to be appointed as a guardian for a 95-year-old woman bed-bound in a nursing home. Arriving at the appointed time of 9:30 a.m., I found 80 people, in a line snaking around the outside of the building, waiting to enter and go through the one available metal scanner.\n\nI inched ahead in the line until I was third from the entrance. A burly man in a guard uniform suddenly came through the door, held his arm horizontally in front of me, and yelled an order for all of us to turn around and proceed to the entrance at the back of the building. Everyone who had made it to the front of the line would now be at the back of the line. I calmly said “no,” and that I had waited once and would like to enter, and I started to walk around him to the door. He held his arm out to stop me and barked his order again, adding, “Do you think you’re someone special?”\n\n“Yes,” I replied, adding below my breath, “We are human beings.” I pushed my way around him and into the building, taking the two women behind me in as well.\n\nThe fact is, everyone in that line deserved dignified treatment — but that’s not the treatment being meted out by employees at 111 Centre Street.\n\nWhen I got upstairs, I took a seat outside Judge Ilana Marcus’ courtroom. Noon arrived, and I still hadn’t been called. I pulled open the courtroom door a crack to see if the elderly patient’s case was still being discussed.\n\nAt that point, a court guard pushed through the door, screamed at me for opening the door, and refused to answer any questions about whether I was even in the right hallway. When I tried to speak, she shut me down.\n\nThat’s how people too often are treated in city agencies and courtrooms. And it’s reflected in the low ratings New Yorkers give city services. Only 27% rate them overall good or excellent, reports the Citizens Budget Commission, though New Yorkers give high ratings to fire protection and garbage collection.\n\nBut if you want to see nastiness, visit the McCarren public pool in Brooklyn. As one swimmer commented, “The attendants in the ladies room are definitely from a prison movie.”\n\nThe quality of public services and their delivery were barely mentioned in the many months of mayoral campaigning, with the candidates battling instead over Trump and the fate of Gaza.\n\nTo the extent Mamdani discussed quality of life in the city, he reduced it to one word: “dignity.” He said, “A life of dignity should not be reserved for the fortunate few.”\n\nBut he talked about only one way of restoring dignity: the government’s role in helping working people afford child care or a decent place to live.\n\n“No New Yorker should ever be priced out of anything they need to survive. … It is government’s job to deliver that dignity.”\n\nChild care and groceries cost money, but on day one, Mamdani can go a long way toward helping New Yorkers feel dignified in this hardscrabble city by asking them to be treated with civility.\n\nMamdani should announce a dignity campaign, calling on public employees to treat all of us with civility instead of herding us like animals and barking instructions at us.\n\nHe should take a page out of the 99th mayor’s playbook. Former Mayor Fiorello La Guardia approached a group of city officials incognito and waited while they ignored him. When one of them finally said something, La Guardia shouted back, “Take off your hat when you speak to a citizen,” as he knocked the hat off the worker’s head.\n\nToday, that would be going too far. Working rules forbid it. But in the 1990s, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani also called for more civility from public employees.\n\nThe New York City Police Department had its “Courtesy, Professionalism, Respect” motto. That should be the code of conduct citywide.\n\nTarget is mandating that its in-store workers smile and make eye contact with shoppers. That’s good business. Customers have options.\n\nNew Yorkers sometimes find themselves with no option but to walk into a courtroom, or into a city agency to apply for a permit. But they should get the same courteous treatment as customers with options.\n\nLaunching a civility campaign and putting some energy behind it could help dispel the skepticism and dread many New Yorkers feel about the incoming Mamdani.\n\nPut that grin to work, Mr. Mayor.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM",

        "text": "Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., praised what he called the \"Avengers\" roster of Democratic leaders but left out his own state's governor, Gavin Newsom. CNN host Kasie Hunt asked the California gubernatorial candidate on Tuesday who he believed the leader of the party was after Democratic strategist James Carville claimed there wouldn't be one until the presidential election. Swalwell was more optimistic, comparing current Democratic lawmakers like Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, and Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., to the Marvel superhero team. CORY BOOKER ADMITS DEMOCRATS 'FAILED IN MY GENERATION' IN SCATHING ASSESSMENT OF HIS OWN PARTY \"It‘s the Avengers right now, right?\" Swalwell said. \"You‘ve got Jasmine Crockett coming to California, helping us elevate the vote to pass Prop 50. Ruben Gallego is going to Iowa and New Hampshire as a Marine, Latino, first in his family to go to college. There‘s a bunch of us who are stepping up, but we all understand, you know, the assignment, and that is to bring down prices, period.\" Hunt pointed out that Swalwell did not mention Gov. Gavin Newsom as a potential leader, despite Newsom being considered a possible 2028 presidential candidate. GAVIN NEWSOM DECLARED AS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S 2028 'FRONTRUNNER' BY POLITICO \"Well, he is a show, don‘t tell leader,\" Swalwell said. \"And that‘s why, you know, you‘re seeing also his leadership style being mimicked by others in a good way because some Democratic leaders send eight-page, strongly-worded letters to the president when they don‘t like something. Gavin Newsom goes to the courts and wins to get the troops out of our streets. And he went to the voters and has won to match what Texas did with their redistricting process. That show, not tell style is what people expect right now.\" Swalwell also confirmed to Hunt that his comments were a direct reference to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE The Democratic Party has been searching for new leadership since the 2024 presidential election. Progressive Democrats have increasingly begun turning against current party leaders like Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., over their handling of the government shutdown and the Trump administration. President Donald Trump has repeatedly labeled Crockett as the future of the Democratic Party, while other Republicans have more broadly suggested progressives like New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.

I mean, for real!” Meyers said, alongside a picture of the U.S. president gleefully looking up at the New York City mayor-elect during his visit to the Oval Office. “Look at that!

Those pills can kill when taken at the wrong stage of pregnancy, and at least two deaths in the last couple of years has demonstrated those risks. Unfortunately, Behn's position is no longer extreme in the Democrat Party, which has become unhinged in several different ways. \n\nFox News: Iowa Democrat Christina Bohannan has built her campaign for Congress around the image of a hard-working, middle-class advocate who understands what it's like \"to struggle to put food on the table.\" \n\nHowever, her real estate portfolio and financial disclosures paint a very different picture — one of expensive homes, a Florida waterfront condo and lucrative stock investments that place Bohannan among the wealthy elite she claims to want to fight against in Congress. ...\n\nHowever, Bohannan's own financial disclosures and local real estate records paint a picture that clashes with her alleged working-class image. In June, Bohannan purchased University of Iowa basketball coach Fran McCaffery's $1.55 million mansion in Iowa City, while for years she has also owned a waterfront condo inside a gated community in Sarasota, Florida. The gated community sells homes ranging from as little as $300,000 to over $1 million, plus requires thousands in annual homeowner's fees.\n\nMeanwhile, according to Bohannan's financial disclosures, her Sarasota condo has also helped her net as much as $50,000 in rental income annually.\n\nEd: Democrats really love their hardscrabble narratives, but only when promulgated by the landed elite. \n\nPlease spare us the tough-guy act @senmarkkelly. You’re not defending the Constitution — you tried to inject doubt into the ranks of the very people who uphold it. That puts service members at risk, and every veteran I know sees right through it. https://t.co/8BOCvFzmok— Dakota Meyer (@Dakota_Meyer) November 25, 2025\n\nEd: It's sheer demagoguery, and veterans and active-duty members see that most clearly. \n\nFree Beacon: New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's transition team has a new \"community safety\" adviser: Alex Vitale, an outspoken supporter of defunding or abolishing virtually every facet of law enforcement from the local to the federal level, including police, prisons, Border Patrol, ICE, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the FBI, among others.\n\nAlex Vitale is the author of The End of Policing, described as the \"bestselling bible of the movement to defund the police.\" He has panned police officers as \"violence workers\" and \"the natural enemy of the working class.\" He has also called to \"abolish prisons,\" \"abolish the Border Patrol,\" \"Abolish the FBI,\" \"Abolish the DEA,\" \"Abolish the Texas Rangers,\" and implement \"open borders.\"\n\nEd: Both John and David wrote about this today, but allow me to add a few thoughts. Vitale is exactly the kind of appointment we can expect to see in a Democratic Socialist administration in New York City. People seemed to think that Mamdani would moderate his approach after winning his election, but why would he do that? He won on the DSA platform. New York voters will get exactly what they voted for. It's already started. \n\nThis story is completely made up.In fact, when this Fake News published, I was in the Oval Office, where President Trump was meeting with his law enforcement team, including FBI Director Kash Patel.I read the headline to the President and he laughed. He said: “What? That’s… https://t.co/qbsy0nW2Bg pic.twitter.com/aNL5Qw9MA8— Karoline Leavitt (@PressSec) November 25, 2025\n\nI read the headline to the President and he laughed. He said: “What? That’s totally false. Come on Kash, let’s take a picture to show them you’re doing a great job!”Do not believe the Fake News!\n\nEd: The most surprising part of this story is that people took M-SNOW seriously in the first place. The premise alone is silly. To the extent that 'unflattering headlines' might be bothering Trump, it's the Department of Justice that's been creating them, not the FBI. Bondi should be more worried than Patel. \n\nFox 9: FOX 9 has not been able to confirm whether the operation was related to immigration enforcement or simply a criminal investigation. FOX 9 has reached out to St. Paul police, the City of St. Paul, and the Department of Homeland Security for more information on the incident.\n\nAgents at the scene did tell FOX 9's Corin Hoggard they were in the area looking for two people, one of whom ran away and went into a house.\n\nEd: Federal agents have jurisdiction everywhere in the US. They do not need to coordinate with local law enforcement, although they usually do just to make sure no mistakes are made. If they are not coordinating with the mayor or the governor, that may reflect a lack of cooperative spirit from those officials.\n\nWhy would you receive a heads up? Your policies want local law enforcement separated from Federal law enforcement. Why would they bother telling you anything? RESIGN! https://t.co/rG1II5dW9g— Jon Justice (@JonJustice) November 25, 2025\n\nEd: No, Walz is NOT always willing to work with federal law enforcement, especially on immigration. He's just beginning to realize that coordination is a courtesy, not a pre-requisite for operations. Welcome to the Supremacy Clause, Governor JazzHands McSnitchLine. \n\nBarak Ravid at Axios: The meeting between President Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) last week got heated when they discussed the possibility of Saudi Arabia joining the Abraham Accords and normalizing relations with Israel, two U.S. officials and one source with knowledge of the situation told Axios.\n\nWhy it matters: With the war in Gaza over, Trump hoped his meeting with MBS would lead to a breakthrough toward Saudi-Israeli normalization.\n\nBoth praised each other publicly and didn't show any daylight between them, but parts of their closed meeting were tense. Trump was disappointed to hear the pushback from MBS, officials say.\n\nEd: This talk is premature. MBS wants to be the final player in the pact, but he won't act until the Gaza situation is fully resolved. Hamas won't disarm, which means the ceasefire agreement will remain stuck on Phase 1. Israel will have to forcibly disarm Hamas to end the war, and Trump should encourage Israel to get it over with so that the Abraham Accords can proceed. \n\nMatt Walsh tears into “right wing” influencers who pretend they are American while operating from overseas. He spotlights an account called “Israelexposed” which lectured a U.S. citizen about “we should deport you” even though the operator is actually Saudi Arabian.Walsh warns… pic.twitter.com/mEUMOU3fhZ— Open Source Intel (@Osint613) November 25, 2025\n\nWalsh warns that this is part of a coordinated foreign push to infiltrate U.S. politics by posing as American voices and stirring divisions inside the right.He adds that a new narrative is spreading online in which anyone who prioritizes American interests first, and does not fixate on Israel every minute of the day, is suddenly branded as “not America First.”\n\nEd: Elon needs to make location data permanently transparent from now on. It doesn't need precision, but each tweet should have country of origin as well as VPN data attached to it. The brief availability of this data has been quite enlightening. \n\nMediaite: Joy Reid believes Vice President JD Vance has a problem: Because President Donald Trump’s supporters are “fundamentally racist,” that means they “can’t have the successor be the guy with the brown Hindu wife.”\n\nAnd the ex-MSNBC host, during an appearance on Jennifer Welch’s I’ve Had It podcast on Tuesday, also fantasized about a bizarre solution: Vance could ditch his wife, Usha Vance, for Erika Kirk.\n\n“Wouldn’t it be the most perfect MAGA fairytale if he finally sees the light that he needs a white queen, instead of this brown Hindu?” Reid said. “I’m not saying that’s happening, or maybe that Usha’s not even in on it, but that’s one entrant.”\n\nThe idea came to Reid a moment after Welch said Vance had been playing “slap and tickle” with slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s widow. Her comment comes a month after some people on social media said Kirk and Vance had an unusually intimate hug before a Turning Point USA event.\n\nEd: Worst. Fanfic. Ever. What in the world is wrong with Joy Reid, anyway? \n\nErika Kirk says she would have gotten less hate if she touched the back of JD Vance’s ass instead of his head in viral hug photo pic.twitter.com/Xl3sboNyvl— HOT SPOT (@HotSpotHotSpot) November 25, 2025\n\nHuman Events: Human Events has obtained text messages sent by Sen. Reuben Gallego (D-AZ) in which he criticizes members of his own party and mocked the appearance of Democratic men and women. ...\n\nIn the exchange, Gallego responds to encouragement that he could rise within his party amid ongoing political infighting. “Oh man have you met my party? I have been yelling at them this whole time,” he wrote. He would also describe the Democrats as the “not fun party,” accusing them of constantly correcting people and losing the cultural energy they used to project. “We used to be the party of sex, drugs and rock and roll,” he said.\n\nGallego mocked the appearance of Democrats and saying that the men look like women and vice versa writing, “Dem women look like Dem men and Dem men look like women.”\n\nEd: Oh, I don't know. Aftyn Behn looks like she'd be a lot of fun at parties, although getting her to leave one might require several people to accomplish. IYKYK.\n\nThis is the most normal thing a Democrat politician has said in the past decade, but I'm sure it won't be long before he's on his hands and knees apologizing for saying it. https://t.co/r2oTQzCkm8— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 25, 2025\n\nEd: Res ipsa loquitur.\n\nWATCH: NYT host/CNN analyst Lulu Garcia-Navarro gets flustered when @ScottJenningsKY brings up #OperationArcticFrost pic.twitter.com/yxa9Po33Ws— Curtis Houck (@CurtisHouck) November 25, 2025\n\nEditor's note: If we thought our job in pushing back against the Academia/media/Democrat censorship complex was over with the election, think again.

        "text": "As the extraordinary Oval Office meeting between Donald Trump and Zohran Mamdani shows, there’s a new bellwether in American politics.\n\nFor years, Ohio played that role. In every election from 1964 to 2016, the state voted for the winning presidential candidate, and every four years journalists would travel there to interview voters in Columbus and Cincinnati, Dayton and Youngstown. But in 2020 Biden won without carrying the state, and today Ohio is deeply red, costing it its bellwether status. Several other states once considered battlegrounds – Iowa, Missouri, and Florida – have also turned firmly Republican.\n\nBut now a new bellwether has emerged: Queens. This humble New York borough contains multitudes. With a population of 2.3 million, it would be the nation’s fifth largest city if it stood alone. And in diversity it is without peer. Nearly half of Queens residents are foreign born. It is about a quarter white, a quarter Latino, nearly a quarter Asian and 17% Black, and 140 languages are spoken there. It’s home to Citi Field and the USTA Tennis Center, LaGuardia and John F Kennedy airports, MoMA PS1 and Aqueduct Racetrack, Archie Bunker of All in the Family and Awkwafina of Nora from Queens.\n\nFlushing is home to so many Asians that its downtown is known as the Chinese Times Square. Astoria has one of the largest Greek populations outside of Greece; Jackson Heights is known as “Little Colombia”; Woodside has a “Little Manila”. Jamaica is home to large African American, Caribbean and Central American populations, while Long Island City has become a magnet for the hip and arty. Queens also has New York’s largest Muslim population as well as 150,000 Jews. Overall, it is thoroughly middle and working class – a swath of heartland America set down in pulsating, cosmopolitan New York.\n\nLike all other New York boroughs except Staten Island, Queens reliably votes Democratic, but in November 2024 it moved decisively toward Trump. Where Joe Biden in 2020 won Queens by 72% to 27% – a 45-point margin – Kamala Harris in 2024 won it by only 24 points. Trump’s gains were especially large in heavily Latino, Chinese and south Asian neighborhoods.\n\nMany of those voting for him were propelled by the rise in disorder that had occurred in the wake of the pandemic and then exacerbated by the sudden influx of migrants. The placement of the migrants in makeshift shelters in residential neighborhoods without adequate support services led to a wave of complaints about crime and loitering as well as resentment over the diversion of resources from longtime residents. As in many other districts, the rise in rents and the cost of groceries contributed to a sense among many that the path to the middle class was becoming increasingly narrow. A political realignment seemed under way.\n\nYet even as Trump was making such inroads, the democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was winning 69% of the vote in her congressional district, which straddles northern Queens and the South Bronx. And, as dissatisfaction with the status quo surged and concerns over affordability mounted, support grew for another young insurgent – Zohran Mamdani.\n\nA state assemblyman whose district includes parts of Astoria and Long Island City, Mamdani in the 24 June Democratic primary won support from a mixed salad of leftish young professionals, working-class Latinos, and recently arrived south Asians – all drawn to his bread-and-butter platform of universal childcare, free buses and a rent freeze. Groups like Drum Beats (Desis Rising Up & Moving) canvassed tens of thousands of residents, including a Bangladeshi population that has tripled over the last decade.\n\nIn the general election, Mamdani got 47.3% of the votes in Queens. “Some of the areas that have been trending towards Trump went for Mamdani,” observed John Mollenkopf, a professor of political science at the Cuny Graduate Center.\n\nTrump concurred. “A lot of my voters voted for him,” the president said during his 21 November meeting with Mamdani. The session seemed to seal Queens’s political arrival. For Trump, too, is a product of the borough. He grew up in Jamaica Estates, a leafy upper-middle-class section located about 10 miles from Mamdani’s Astoria home. Both are anti-establishment figures with a knack for understanding and addressing the needs of those with “fingers bruised from lifting boxes on the warehouse floor, palms calloused from delivery by handlebars, [and] knuckles scarred with kitchen burns”, as Mamdani put it in his victory speech.\n\nWith Ocasio-Cortez contemplating a run for higher office, Queens is proving an important seedbed for national politics, and New York-based journalists – rather than have to book flights to the midwest – can now hop on the 7 train to Jackson Heights or Flushing.\n\nYet national news organizations have treated the borough like flyover country. The New York Times in particular has been a step behind. Back in the 90s, the paper had a sizable metro section that thoroughly covered the outer boroughs and the tristate region. But as the Times mushroomed into a global paper – it now has more readers in California than in New York – it has shortchanged the city’s blue-collar precincts. Today, driverless cars in San Francisco get as much coverage in the paper as taxi drivers in Corona.\n\nAs a result, the Times, during the mayoral race, failed to grasp the groundswell developing behind Mamdani. And, when his strength did become evident, it was strangely dismissive and even hostile toward him, sniffing in an editorial that because of his lack of experience and concern about the disorder in the city, “we do not believe that Mr. Mamdani deserves a spot on New Yorkers’ ballots.”\n\nIt followed with an “exposé” about how as a high school senior Mamdani (who was born in Uganda) had checked multiple boxes on his college application to Columbia about his race, purportedly to gain an advantage. Mamdani explained that he considered himself “an American who was born in Africa” and that his answers were an attempt to represent his complex background given the limited choices before him. The piece fed the perception that the Times was “on a crusade against Mamdani”, as Margaret Sullivan put it in the Guardian.\n\nAfter his victory, the paper, noting his ascension and Ocasio-Cortez’s continuing strength, ran a piece about how Queens “is having its moment”. With the borough claiming three of the top four spots in a survey of city-neighborhoods-to-watch in 2025; with Astoria emerging as a favorite among young professionals; and with the Rockaways becoming a summer staple, the Times observed, “Could Queens become the new Brooklyn?”\n\nIt already is the new Ohio.\n\n Michael Massing is an American writer based in New York City.

        "text": "New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani disclosed what happened during his White House meeting with President Donald Trump last week.\n\nThe democratic socialist, when asked about the “weirdest” thing he spotted during the visit in an appearance on “The Adam Friedland Show,” said he was sitting down and waiting for his meeting with the president when he saw “all these different coffee table books” in front of him.\n\n“One of them is ‘UFC at the White House,’” said Mamdani, adding that he had “no idea” about the mixed martial arts event set to take place on the South Lawn in June. “I was just flipping through that.”\n\nMamdani, when asked by Friedland if he saw photos of guys fighting each other in the book, noted that it was just a visualization of what the UFC’s octagon-shaped cage arena would look like on the South Lawn.\n\nThe event — which Trump first teased in July as part of America’s 250th anniversary celebration — is expected to include fighter weigh-ins at the Lincoln Memorial and is scheduled to coincide with the president’s 80th birthday on June 14, 2026.\n\nUFC President and CEO Dana White — in an interview with Fox News in September — revealed that the seating capacity for the event would be around 5,000, citing security concerns. This marks a notable drop from Trump’s initial estimate of up to 25,000 spectators.\n\nWhite, who has endorsed Trump since his 2016 campaign, has also claimed that a park near the White House could host 85,000 people to watch the event on TV screens. He told Sports Business Journal in October that his company would pay $700,000 to replace the White House lawn after the event.\n\nFriedland asked Mamdani whether he was planning to attend the event.\n\n“No,” replied Mamdani with a chuckle.",

        "text": "The late radio host Rush Limbaugh used his 2010 Thanksgiving broadcast to remind listeners of the true story of Thanksgiving.\n\nIt's a lesson that feels especially relevant today, as the Democratic Party is being swallowed whole by radical left-wingers in the Democratic Socialists of America movement, who seek to undermine the nation from within (in what we've coined \"Invisible Insurrection\") and push the country into a socialist hellhole and eventually communism.\n\nIn less than 36 days, Zohran Mamdani will become the next mayor of New York City, ushering in a radical strain of the Democratic Party that blends Marxism and Islamism - a combination that does not align with Western values.\n\nMore broadly, the rudderless Democratic Party has been hijacked by radical DSA, who prioritize Marxist ideology and illegal aliens over capitalism and native-born Americans.\n\nIt's a deeply troubling trajectory for the party of unhinged purple-haired liberal-educated people that refuses to learn from history as it aims to push policies that undermine private property, restrict freedoms, and expand state-run economics and central planning - models that have epically failed around the world.\n\nJust look at the catastrophic collapses of Venezuela, Cuba, North Korea, and countless others, and these collapses have led to death and mass starvation. Yet, America's liberal college industrial complex continues to brainwash kids into a flawed way of toxic thinking. \n\nBack to Limbaugh's 2010 Thanksgiving broadcast. In short, he says the traditional Thanksgiving narrative celebrates cooperation and Native-American generosity. However, the early years of Plymouth Colony underscore how incentives, property rights, and institutional design shaped survival and laid the groundwork for the later celebration in the American founding.\n\nPilgrims tried socialism when they first landed—no private property, everything held in common. They nearly starved to death. Bradford’s introduction of capitalism and property rights saved the colony.\nEthnic and religious homogeneity didn’t save them. Freedom and ownership did. pic.twitter.com/RvoDwWOjuk\n— Joel Berry (@JoelWBerry) August 4, 2025\n\nIn other words, the Plymouth Colony tried the communal property system and miserably failed. Once private-property incentives were unlocked, they enabled productivity, self-sufficiency, and flourishing in a free society. \n\nPerhaps Limbaugh's Plymouth Colony story should serve as yet another reminder to Democrats who refuse to learn from history simply because they've persuaded themselves that this time will be different. \n\nThe Pilgrims tried socialism.\nIt nearly killed the colony\nWhen Bradford restored private property, abundance returned.\nSocialism fails because it denies human nature and God’s design. @RHelfenbein pic.twitter.com/hiFq3KNFYB\n— Standing for Freedom Center (@freedomcenterlu) November 25, 2025\n\nIt would be a great story to tell the unhinged, triple-vaxxed liberal aunt at Thanksgiving.",

        "text": "Across the political spectrum, with alarm on the right and delight on the left, the display of warmth from Donald Trump toward Zohran Mamdani on Friday set off shock waves. The president’s lavish praise of the New York City mayor-elect in the Oval Office was a 180-degree turn from his condemnation of the democratic socialist as “a pure true communist” and “a total nut job.” The stunning reversal made for a great political drama. But what does it portend? \n\nTrump and his MAGA followers are hardly going to forsake their standard mix of bigotry, anti-immigrant mania and other political toxins. Demagoguery has long fueled the Republican engine — and in the 11 months until the midterm elections, skullduggery to thwart democracy promises to accelerate rather than slow down.\n\nWhile countless media outlets have marveled at the appearance of a sudden Trump-Mamdani “bromance,” the spectacle has rekindled hopes that America can become less polarized and find more common ground. But what kind of common ground can — or should — be found with the leader of today’s fascistic GOP? \n\nIt’s true that Mamdani has a huge stake in diverting the Trump bull from goring New York. Billions of dollars are at stake in federal aid to the city, and New York would be thrown into a chaotic crisis if the president were to make good on his threats to send in federal troops. Mamdani seems to have deftly prevented such repressive actions against his city, at least for a while.\n\nUnderstandably, the mayor-elect’s main concern is his upcoming responsibility for New York and its 8.5 million residents. But as important as the Big Apple is, Trump’s draconian and dictatorial orders nationwide are also at stake. It’s unclear that the chemistry between the two leaders will do anything at all to help protect immigrants in Chicago, Charlotte, Portland, Los Angeles — or anywhere else in the country.\n\nThe president’s accolades for a leftist certainly confounded the perennial left-bashers at Fox News and many other right-wing outlets, and such discombobulation among pro-MAGA media operatives has been a pleasure to behold. But there’s more than a wisp of wishful thinking in the air from progressives eager to believe that Trump’s effusive statements about Mamdani, an avowed socialist, will help to legitimize socialism for the American public.\n\nTrump’s turnaround might cause some Americans to reconsider their anti-left reflexes. But it’s also plausible that ripple effects of the episode could help to legitimize, in some people’s eyes, the president’s leadership even while it continues to inflict horrific policies and anti-democratic politics on the country. Gracious and avuncular performances by despots are nothing new, as when Trump hosted Bill Maher at the White House last spring and the comedian returned the favor by proclaiming that the president had been “gracious and measured.” Neither are cosmetics on the face of a fascist.\n\nA hazard is that the image of Trump as a tolerant, open-minded president, in convivial discourse with New York’s progressive leader, could undercut the solid accusations that Trump is imposing tyrannical policies on America. Just a day before he met with Mamdani, the president seemed to suggest executing several congressional Democrats who filmed a video reminding U.S. military personnel of their duty to not obey illegal orders.\n\nWant more sharp takes on politics? Sign up for our free newsletter, Standing Room Only, written by Amanda Marcotte, now also a weekly show on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nThe most publicized few seconds of the public portion of Trump and Mamdani’s meeting came when a journalist asked about the mayor-elect’s past charge that the president is a fascist. The exchange was widely reported as an amusing moment, as Trump quipped that Mamdani should just say yes and affirm that the president is a fascist.\n\nBut the danger of normalizing autocracy is heightened when the utterly serious appraisal of Trump as a fascist can be recast as a media punchline.\n\nOver the weekend, Mamdani stood his ground during an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” He pointed out that he had replied “yes” to the reporter’s question about Trump being a fascist. “Everything that I’ve said in the past, I continue to believe,” he added. \n\nHow long Mamdani will remain in Trump’s good graces is anyone’s guess. No doubt the mayor-elect is fully aware that the president could turn on him with a vengeance. If Trump can do that to one of his most loyal ideological fighters, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, he can certainly do it to Mamdani.\n\nTo call Trump “mercurial” is a vast understatement. And yet, in countless ways, with his rhetoric and with the power of the presidency, he has been unwavering and consistent — as immigrants being terrorized by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and single mothers trying to feed their families know all too well. Given all the harm his policies are doing every minute, it would be unwise to take seriously Trump’s broken-clock pronouncements that are occasionally accurate and decent.\n\nDemocratic socialists don’t need Trump’s approval. We need to defeat his MAGA agenda and movement. Right now, it’s unclear whether what happened with him and Mamdani in the Oval Office will make that defeat any more likely.\n\nMamdani and Trump found each other newly useful last Friday. Only later will we know who was more effectively using whom.\n\nWhile it’s all well and good to laud Mamdani’s extraordinary political talents and inspiring leadership for social justice, at the same time we should recognize that he has entered into an embrace with a rattlesnake. Even when it purrs, it’s still a rattlesnake.",

        "text": "In the wake of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s victory in New York City, it’s hard to be optimistic about America’s young voters. An Axios poll released days before the mayoral election found that a concerning 67% of U.S. college students have either a positive or neutral association with the word “socialism.” And it appears they have an even greater appreciation for the word “Zohran,” as roughly three-fourths of voters under 30 cast their ballots for the anti-capitalist who promised them government-run grocery stores.\n\nWhile these numbers are depressing for those of us who don’t want to see American supermarket shelves resemble those in Venezuela, the data alone might be explained away as part of a natural political development cycle—a youthful naïveté that will eventually give way to a more mature conservatism. As the famous saying goes, “If you are young and not liberal, then you have no heart; but if you are old and not conservative, then you have no brain.” \n\nBut liberalism is not socialism, and what if their young minds are being permanently damaged by dangerous TikTok algorithms and the brainwashing of anti-American teachers?\n\nIt’s hard to avoid that conclusion after watching TikTok reactions to Mamdani’s win in this compilation video released by Ben Shapiro:\n\nThe second young woman featured in the video makes the dubious claim that American schools actually do teach that socialism is bad (which schools is she talking about so I can enroll my kids ASAP?). Even if they were teaching kids not to hate capitalism (they’re not), this woman makes it clear they’re doing a terrible job.\n\nI think the vast majority of Americans do not understand socialism whatsoever. You have been bred throughout our entire education to believe that socialism is this evil, bad, big-government dictatorship thing. When, in reality, a simple Google search would literally prove that wrong. Socialism is simply just a concept that the good of the people, as a collective, is prioritized by the government over private ownership and private wealth.\n\nShe, of course, favors the Democratic Socialists of America-approved \"C\" word — collective — over \"capitalism.\" As the DSA website explains: \"We want to collectively own the key economic drivers that dominate our lives, such as energy production and transportation.\" \n\nWhy is this type of message so appealing to young voters? Paul Mueller, in a warning about a \"wave of radical socialist sentiment,\" writes in Law & Liberty:\n\nCollectivism is a kind of \"political junk food\" that people crave in periods when they are particularly hungry for community and solidarity. Collectivism means socializing things through force, rather than through voluntary community. Collectivism demands forced redistribution of wealth and uses this or that version of the “common” interest to undermine individual ownership, choice, and rights.\n\nThis political outlook is particularly devastating for young people, as Mueller explains:\n\nConsider again the young college graduates who drove Mamdani’s radical candidacy to electoral success. They engaged, for a time, in political advocacy. But what do they do after the sugar rush fades? Do they return to building their families? Most are not married, and those who are likely don’t have children. Do they return to building up their churches, synagogues, or mosques? Most are not part of these institutions. We can be forgiven for wondering whether they engage in real civic associations at all.\n\nSpeaking of families, the first young woman in the video advises on how to talk to family members who say Mamdani is a socialist. This is advice that many young liberals will surely be following this Thanksgiving:\n\nIf you encounter someone who tries to tell you he is a socialist, like, let's say, your boomer parents, this is what you need to explain to them. Mamdani is not a socialist. He’s a democratic socialist. Socialist countries are like North Korea and Cuba. You know what Mamdani is? A democratic socialist.\n\nOf course, Mamdani has flat-out said he doesn't like capitalism. Not even Pedro Sánchez, the prime minister of Spain and member of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (emphasis added), would say that out loud. I've written before about the similarities between Mamdani and Sanchez: They're both self-proclaimed feminists who hate Israel about as much as they love high taxes, and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party advocates for \"social democracy\" just as Mamdani's DSA does.\n\nHow’s that working out for young people in Spain? The youth unemployment rate is about 25%, one of the highest in Europe, and about that many — 1 in 4 20-to-40-year-olds — still live at home. \n\nNow for the good news: Young Spaniards are increasingly realizing that the radical left’s policies are failing to improve their lives, with a growing number turning to the conservative, populist Vox party. A recent poll found that 27.9% of 18- to 24-year-olds, and 26% of 25-to-34-year-olds, plan to cast their ballot for Vox at the next election. The Economist reports, \"Among Spanish men aged under 25 Vox is now the leading party, and among males under 45 it enjoys more support than the mainstream conservative People’s Party.\"\n\nJust as Mamdani calls Trump a fascist, the mainstream media and the political establishment attempt to dismiss Vox by labeling it far-right, even as it represents the values and concerns of ordinary Spaniards. \n\nHere’s a video featuring young people explaining why they support Vox. They sound a little wiser than the TikTokers above.\n\nOne young Spaniard says of Vox leader Santiago Abascal, \"I think he’s the future president of Spain, and the only salvation we have for this country.\"\n\nHis friend says, \"Yes, the truth is that what we have now is terrible. I mean, this has to come out because if not, we’re going to end up like underdeveloped countries. And this can’t happen.\"\n\nAnother young man puts the lie to the claim that Vox is the continuation of former Spanish dictator Francisco Franco: \"There is a lot of talk about the right being pro-Franco. And I have to stay that Franco died in 1975. Francoism no longer exists. So to portray a right-wing party as pro-Franco is absurd.\"\n\nFinally, another young man expresses his exasperation with a political class that isn’t responding to people’s needs: \"Honestly, [we need] someone who is going to save us from the government we have right now because it’s the only option we have left because they constantly lie to us with everything the government says like [about] the housing [crisis].\"\n\nMaybe \"crazy\" boomer parents should arm themselves with this video at the Thanksgiving dinner table to counter the claims of their pro-Mamdani socialist kids.\n\nBefore you go, a quick heads-up: for Black Friday, you can join PJ Media VIP for 60% off with the promo code FIGHT.\n\nAnd here’s the big twist this year — anyone who signs up for VIP Platinum during this sale is automatically entered to win one of five lifetime Platinum memberships.

        "text": "We are told this was merely a protest. We are urged to contextualize. To soften. To relativize. To move along.\n\nOn the evening of November 19, 2025, Park East Synagogue in Manhattan became the target of organized intimidation that included more than 200 “protesters” there to terrify Jews as they exited their house of worship. What unfolded fits not the language of dissent but the architecture of coercion, and worse—terrorism. A megaphone directive, held by one of the leaders, rang out to the mob with disturbing clarity: “We need to make them scared. We need to make them scared. We need to make them scared.” \n\nThe mob chanted back with undeniable bloodlust:\n\n “From New York to Gaza, globalize the Intifada!” “Resistance, you make us proud, take another settler out!”“Death to the IDF!”“Intifada revolution … There is only one solution: Intifada revolution.”\n\nThe strategy was explicit. The goal was fear. It was driven by hate. \n\nThis was not protected speech in its pure constitutional sense. This was speech aimed at menacing, threatening, and disrupting religious exercise — conduct squarely addressed by both New York State and federal law.\n\nNew York Penal Law § 240.21 (Aggravated Harassment in the First Degree) criminalizes communication intended to harass, annoy, threaten, or alarm another person based on race or religion when it places that person in reasonable fear.\n\nNew York Penal Law § 240.30 further expands harassment statutes to cover acts that seriously annoy or alarm another person with no legitimate purpose.\n\nMore pointedly, the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE Act), 18 U.S.C. § 248, explicitly protects individuals exercising religious freedom from intimidation, threat, or force. Houses of worship fall into this protective framework where access is obstructed or worshippers are threatened.\n\nAdd to this the constitutional bedrock of the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause, reinforced by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (42 U.S.C. § 2000bb), and the legal clarity becomes unavoidable: Jews leaving a synagogue are not legitimate targets for political theater — and the state has a duty to defend them.\n\nAnd yet, law enforcement was inadequate. The laws sat dormant. The moment passed without the urgency it demanded.\n\nWhat filled the vacuum was not leadership. It was Mamdani.\n\nZohran Mamdani’s response was not a rebuke of intimidation but a reframing of Jewish heritage itself as suspect. His language suggested that Jewish gathering space must be scrutinized, contextualized, justified — as if its legitimacy must be granted by an ideological authority. He cast the synagogue event as a “misuse of sacred space” rather than standing unequivocally between worshippers and those who sought to frighten them.\n\nThis is not mere political spin. It is a pattern. It’s also foreshadowing. \n\nMamdani emerges here not as mediator but as provocateur — a political figure who stokes division through moral inversion: recasting victims as instigators, redefining safety as privilege, and suspicion as justice. It is ideological governance masquerading as compassion.\n\nAnd this is where the deeper pattern reveals itself.\n\nThe philosophy underpinning this response bears the unmistakable imprint of Communism: where individual rights bow to ideological conformity and where identity groups are permitted safety only when aligned with the ruling narrative.\n\nIn Mamdani’s New York City, sacred space will no longer sacred — it is conditional.\n\nSpeech will no longer be free — it will be filtered through political utility.\n\nCitizenship will no longer be equal — it will be tiered according to ideological compliance.\n\nThis is not a theoretical abstraction. It is how societies slide.\n\nSo the question before New York is not merely electoral. It is civilizational.\n\nWhat will New York City look like for Jews under Mamdani’s leadership?\n\nFor Christians?\n\nFor American patriots who believe loyalty to this nation should not require suppression of conscience?\n\nWhat kind of city is forged when leadership treats faith and heritage as suspect and intimidation as contextual? When the right to worship, practice tradition or express identity must be negotiated through ideological framing rather than protected by law?\n\nAre we crafting a tomorrow that future generations will examine in remorse — asking how we allowed intimidation to be normalized, how democratic pluralism yielded to ideological rigidity, how fear replaced freedom?\n\nHistory has a pattern, and it is unforgiving to those who ignore it. It records not only the acts of aggressors, but the silence of those who rationalized them.\n\nWe will not be distracted.\n\nNot by bureaucratic sleight-of-hand.\n\nNot by media deflection.\n\nNot by rhetorical softening of antisemitism into “activism.”\n\nA synagogue was besieged.\n\nThe law was sidelined.\n\nAnd leadership failed.\n\nThe question now is not whether Zohran Mamdani will impose his ideology upon us. The question is whether we will listen — and whether we will remember which path leads to freedom, and which leads quietly to the wrong side of history.",

        "text": "When some families play Monopoly, they put any taxes or fines paid by players into the middle of the board. Land on Free Parking, and you win that pot of money.\n\nThe problem is that this breaks the game.\n\nThe whole point of Monopoly, of course, is to force other players into bankruptcy. That’s how you win. But as hundreds of dollars get randomly redistributed, players who were down on their luck are suddenly flush with cash, prolonging an already interminable game.\n\nSomething like this has happened to our presidential primaries. Once governed by a set of rules designed to produce a nominee by rough consensus, primary fields have been warped by successive changes to how the game is played that have led to a system practically guaranteed to produce chaos instead of a clear winner.\n\nAt some point, the primary field has to be winnowed.\n\nNow, some Democrats are discussing a rule change that would fix a couple of these issues at once, even if it didn't solve everything. But before we get into how it would work, let’s talk about the problem.\n\nIn both the Democratic and Republican primaries, there are simply too many candidates. In 2016, at least 17 major candidates ran for the Republican presidential nomination. In 2020, at least 29 candidates sought the Democratic nomination. It’s still early but the 2028 Democratic field is already looking like it could be similarly crowded.\n\nThere are various reasons why so many campaigns get underway — most prominent among them less centralized political parties and campaign finance laws that allow weak candidates who have a couple of deep-pocketed donors to run in an overly long pre-election season (which starts a full year before anyone actually walks into a voting booth).\n\nTo be fair, it’s not necessarily a bad thing that so many people want to be president. Go ahead, kid, shoot your shot.\n\nAt some point, though, the field has to be winnowed. On the Republican side, the system favors whoever wins the most votes in a given primary, even if that candidate didn’t get a majority. That’s how the GOP in 2016 ended up with Trump, who pulled off plurality wins in the beginning of the primary season until he was unstoppable, even as the majority of voters favored someone else.\n\nOn the Democratic side, the party has long used an elaborate system of awarding delegates proportionally, with overly complicated rules that make “The Cones of Dunshire” board game on “Parks and Recreation” look like Go Fish. The effect is that this drags out the primary process (see: Hillary Clinton vs. Barack Obama in 2008 and Hillary Clinton vs. Bernie Sanders in 2016). It can lead to warring factions with such goofy names as PUMAs and Bernie Bros, undermining party unity.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopefuls participate in the fourth Democratic primary debate of the 2020 presidential campaign on Oct. 15, 2019, in Westerville, OHio.\n\nThe solution that was reported on this week, which Democrats such as Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, and pollster Celinda Lake are proposing, is called ranked-choice voting. Instead of picking just one candidate out of the field, voters can rank candidates in order of their preference, typically up to five. If no one gets a majority, the lowest-ranked candidate is eliminated, and the second-choice votes of everyone who backed them are then redistributed. This goes on in successive rounds until one candidate secures a majority.\n\nThis may sound complicated, but it’s not that different from a runoff, which many states use if no candidate wins a majority. The difference is that you don’t have to go back and vote again; you just rank them all in one go.\n\nRanked-choice voting isn’t a radical new idea. It’s been used in national elections in Australia since 1919. Closer to home, it is used in races for mayor and city council in progressive enclaves such as as San Francisco and Cambridge, Massachusetts. Two states — Maine and Alaska — use it for statewide elections, but the most high-profile recent example came in New York City’s mayoral primary, in which Zohran Mamdani rose to the top of a 10-person field. (Hollywood also approves: Ranked-choice voting has been used by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to determine the Best Picture winner since 2009.)\n\nRanked-choice voting would solve two big problems facing Democrats.\n\nFirst, it allows voters to have their say without elaborate head games over “wasting” their vote. You want to vote for that candidate with whom you really agree the most? Rank them first. Then put the more “electable” candidate as your second pick. Is there someone — say, a disgraced former governor — you really don’t want to win? Rank everyone but that candidate.\n\nRanked-choice voting would solve two big problems facing Democrats.\n\nSecond, it encourages candidates to play nice. In a ranked-choice election, the key to winning isn’t just picking up first-choice votes, but also getting a good number of second- and third-choice votes. That discourages negative advertising and encourages candidates to form mutually beneficial alliances. Research has found that voters think ranked-choice elections are less negative.\n\nThere are some problems with ranked-choice voting, including what political scientists call “ballot exhaustion,” which happens when voters burn out from ranking so many races or simply don’t know enough about all the candidates. But that isn’t a problem in a high-profile presidential primary. Voters have months to learn about different candidates and hear them debate the issues in depth.\n\nRepublicans could benefit from the same system, but they’ve come out against it, arguing that it’s too confusing, leads to wasted votes and slows down results. (They also argue that it would reduce the influence of the major political parties, which may be their core objection.) Not only has the Republican National Committee passed a resolution opposing it, but several Republican-run states have banned cities from experimenting with it.\n\nThat should give Democrats another reason to support this approach. They have a chance to create a presidential primary system that would encourage their candidates to run broader, more inclusive campaigns and avoid negative campaigning; help the party settle on a nominee relatively quickly without in-fighting; and allow voters to feel like their voices were heard.\n\nThat would put their eventual nominee in a much better position for the general election, particularly against a Republican who won after running in the current, flawed system.",

        "text": "New York City progressives were dealt a blow on Wednesday, just weeks after Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s landmark victory, as a more moderate Democrat announced she has enough support to become the next City Council speaker.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Mamdani’s team for comment via email.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nMamdani’s victory was a major win for progressives. Earlier in November, he defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa to become the leader of the nation’s largest city. But his ability to push his agenda through hinges on a cooperative city council. More moderate Democrats and Republicans on the council could block his policies, including free bus services and city-run grocery stores.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nCouncil Member Julie Menin, a Democrat who represents the Upper East Side, announced that she has garnered enough support to become its next speaker. If this holds, she would defeat Council Member Crystal Hudson, a progressive seen as more in line with Mamdani.\n\nMenin said she would have support from at least 36 current and incoming members of the New York City Council across all five boroughs. Her coalition includes many Democrats, as well as a handful of Republicans who serve on the committee.\n\nCouncil Member Joann Ariola is among the Republicans supporting Menin.\n\nNew York City Council Member Julie Menin speaks in New York City on June 28, 2022.\n\n“She has spent her entire career delivering for the people of New York. She’s been a business owner, a nonprofit leader, a commissioner, and a Council Member, and at every step she’s shown that she can cut through the red tape of city bureaucracy and produce real results. Her depth of experience and her proven record of leadership make her exactly the Speaker the Council needs right now,” Ariola wrote on X.\n\nThe New York Times reported that some members viewed Menin as a “check” on Mamdani, who will take office in January 2026. She told the Times she believes she plans to have a “close and collaborative relationship with the administration.”\n\nWhile she is viewed as a potential foil to Mamdani, Menin did congratulate him on his victory earlier in November. She wrote on X that she was “excited” to collaborate with him on “an agenda that meets the challenges of this moment and withstands the threats we face from a Trump-led Washington.”\n\nShe also praised his messaging on the affordability of child care and housing, saying it is a “vision I share.”\n\nMore progressive City Council members, including those affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), of which Mamdani is a member, did not endorse Menin for speaker.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nDemocratic pollster Adam Carlson wrote on X: “God we need Speaker Crystal Hudson so badly. Julie Menin would just spend most of the time trying to being a foil to Mamdani to set up a 2029 mayoral run.”\n\nNew York City Council Member Kamillah M. Hanks wrote on X: “Julie has the vision to move our City forward and the knowledge and tenacity to get things done! I am proud to support @JulieMenin to lead the NYC Council as our next Speaker!”\n\nJeff Coltin, a reporter for Politico, wrote on X: “Julie Menin is miles apart from Zohran Mamdani’s political base on an identity level, but politically, it’s not as clear cut. She was trusted by de Blasio, close with labor unions and is quick to remind you she was the one that gave Ossé’s broker fee bill a hearing and a vote.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nMamdani will take office in January. The New York City Council will also meet in January, when new members take office.",

The officers then realized the men were ICE officers. \n\nIn his letter, Goldman inquired about the protocol in place for NYPD officers to respond to federal law enforcement: “Has your Department issued guidance or protocol to officers advising them how to respond to federal agents operating without visible identifiers or markings during enforcement operations or actions? If so, please provide such guidance.”\n\nThe congressman also expressed his concerns over the agent’s failure to identify themselves as being with ICE. “Has your Department raised concerns related to public safety stemming from federal officials failing to identify themselves directly to the Department of Homeland Security? If so, please provide details about your concerns and any response you received,” he wrote.\n\nThe letter is under review by the department, NYPD Executive Director of Communications Brad Weeks stated. \n\nGoldman’s letter follows his previous remarks on the city’s sanctuary city laws, in which he stated that the Mamdani administration must alter the city statute to allow local law enforcement to intervene in the operations of federal agents that violate local law. \n\n“The most important thing is for the NYPD to change its approach,” Goldman said on Oct. 21, adding that the NYPD should be allowed to “intervene to protect New Yorkers from the lawlessness that ICE is repeatedly and consistently demonstrating as part of [President] Donald Trump’s fascist immigration dragnet.” \n\nTRUMP’S WARM EMBRACE OF MAMDANI COMPLICATES 2026 GOP MESSAGING\n\nGoldman made his remarks in a letter to Tisch a day earlier, asking the city to “strictly enforce” the law against lawbreaking federal agents. \n\n“I write to request that the New York City Police Department (NYPD or Department) be prepared to strictly enforce state and local laws in order to hold federal agents accountable for any unlawful actions they engage in, including potentially through arrest and prosecution for felony violations,” he wrote.",

        "text": "Artificial intelligence is currently leading the pack in the race for TIME's 2025 Person of the Year, holding a 36% chance, according to Polymarket.\n\nFollowing AI are NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang at 24%, Pope Leo XIV at 15%, and former President Donald Trump at 7%. Elon Musk trails with just a 2% chance, despite his previous high-profile public influence.\n\nOther notable names include Sam Altman at 6% and Zohran Mamdani at 3%.\n\nThe leading candidates show that it's not just humans shaping global influence; it can also be technology.\n\nCan AI Truly Be TIME's Person of the Year?\n\nInterestingly, TIME magazine has historically named both individuals and abstract concepts as Person of the Year, like 'The Computer' in 1982.\n\nThe concept of AI being chosen may continue this tradition, especially since TIME has been recognising that ideas can also influence society, like how AI impacts all industries today.\n\nAlthough AI cannot accept the award itself, the recognition would be symbolic.\n\nWhy AI Has the Best Odds\n\nPrediction markets suggest AI is ahead for several reasons.\n\nEven Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA, has seen 24% odds due to his role in advancing AI hardware and software. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, also benefits indirectly from AI.\n\nInvestors and market watchers see AI as both a transformative tool and a cultural phenomenon, capable of changing how people work, communicate, and create. The betting volumes, $808,092 (£658,000) for AI alone, far surpass those for other candidates, indicating strong public interest and perceived likelihood of the selection.\n\nHow TIME Chooses Its Person of the Year\n\nTIME evaluates candidates based on their influence over the past year, not necessarily whether that influence is positive. Editors consider public engagement, news coverage, and historical significance.\n\nBesides the usual human figures, TIME has sometimes recognized non-human entities, showing that influence is the main factor. AI's influence and use in healthcare, finance, art, and communications make it a suitable candidate by these standards.\n\nPublic polls, social media attention, and economic indicators also play a role in the editorial decision, even if the final selection rests with TIME's editorial board.\n\nRecords for TIME Covers\n\nWhile AI may top the 2025 odds, cultural influence continues to play a major role in TIME's visibility.\n\nTaylor Swift, with less than 1% odds this year, holds the record for the best-selling Time Person of the Year issue of all time. Her 2023 cover sold more copies than any other issue in over a decade.\n\nMeanwhile, former US President Richard Nixon has appeared on Time's cover more than anyone else, with 55 appearances from 1952 to 1994.\n\nThese records show that while AI may be at the forefront this year, celebrity and human achievement are still key to the magazine's cultural impact.\n\nWhen Will TIME Announce The 2025 Person of the Year?\n\nThe announcement of TIME's 2025 Person of the Year is expected at the end of December. Whether AI wins the title or a human candidate takes it, the list shows different people in their own industry who have been made a public focus over the impressions they have left.\n\nFor now, the attention is on artificial intelligence, which has a 36% chance, making it the most watched contender in the magazine's long history of annual selections.\n\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK",

Would you like to see a democratic socialist candidate win the 2028 presidential election?”\n\nAcross the board, 51 percent said “yes,” they would like to see a democratic socialist win the 2028 presidential election. Only 32 percent said “no,” and 17 percent remain unsure.\n\nPredictably, opinions are sharply divided on party lines. Eighty-two percent of Democrats under 40 said they would like to see a democratic socialist win the 2028 presidential election, compared to eight percent who said no and nine percent who remain unsure.\n\nOn the flip side, 65 percent of Republicans under 40 said they do not want to see that, compared to 24 percent who do and 11 percent who remain unsure.\n\nIndependents are pretty divided, as 37 percent said they would like a democratic socialist to win the 2028 presidential election, followed by 32 percent who remain unsure and 31 percent who said no.\n\nWhen asked who has influenced them the most to support democratic socialism, over a quarter of respondents, 27 percent, said it was a parent, followed by 17 percent who said online videos or podcasts, ten percent who said books, and seven percent who said a grandparent. Six percent attributed that support to print or digital news publications, five percent to television shows, five percent to a church leader, and four percent to a teacher in college or high school.\n\nA plurality of Democrats and Republicans who support democratic socialism attributed the influence to their parents, while the highest percentage of independents, 18 percent, said books.\n\nThe survey of 1,496 U.S. likely voters between the ages of 18-39 was conducted on October 31-November 2, 2025, and it has a margin of error of +/- 3 percent.\n\nThe survey follows the rise of Muslim socialist Zohran Mamdani, the mayor-elect in New York City, who has pushed radial ideas including city-owned grocery stores. He has also suggested that “mental health experts” should respond to crimes rather than police.\n\nIt also comes as Democrat infighting becomes more prominent as seen during the Democrat government shutdown, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) trying to appease the far-left base of his party.",

        "text": "When it comes to talking to Gen Z men the right is beginning to sound a bit like the left: You can’t get ahead. The whole world is stacked against you. You’re the real victim here.\n\nPodcaster Ben Shapiro recently said as much at a recent event, when he called out conservatives for inculcating young men with a “nihilistic” worldview rather than giving them the “tough talk” they need.\n\n“I think that the right is actually weirdly feminizing young men by giving them a victimology to buy into,” Shapiro said at the Jewish Leadership Conference. “This notion that you, as a Gen Z male, are facing these obstacles that no other human has faced for all of human history, like, read a book for once! Like seriously, go talk to your grandfather.”\n\nYoung conservative men are being told that it’s impossible to get a house, a girlfriend, a job, even get off their phones. Yes, these might be real challenges, but politicians insisting life is nothing but an uphill battle is toxic.\n\nThis is the sort of victim complex conservatives recently accused the left of promoting. What happened to the “pull yourself up by the bootstraps” party?\n\nSpeaking in New York City on November 16, Shapiro acknowledged that young people have been failed by a “political class that lies to them.” But he also worried they’re being robbed of agency.\n\n“Maybe this is just the nature of politics, which is that politicians have a stake in telling you that you have unsolvable problems that only they can solve if you give them enough power,” he said. “But the problem is, if you say that to young men and you remove the agency from them, they get angry and they don’t know what to do with that anger.”\n\nYoung conservatives have been assaulted with reasons that they can’t get ahead. When politicians and influencers have your ear via screens 24/7, their doomerism can make the world’s problems feel insurmountable — and make you feel very, very small.\n\nYes, free speech on campus has been a massive problem particularly for conservatives, but you can still be bold and put yourself out there. And you will survive. Yes, it’s true that DEI and identity politics got out of hand, but white America isn’t under siege.\n\nYes, illegal immigration has been out of control, but there isn’t a conspiracy to replace you. Yes, the war on toxic masculinity went too far, but that doesn’t preclude young men from aspiring to find a healthy expression of their own manhood.\n\nYes, feminism sometimes goes a bit overboard, but that doesn’t mean all women suck and you’ll never find a suitable mate. Yes, your phone is full of flashy, addictive algorithmic sirens luring you in, but it’s also within your power to put it away.\n\nYes, the economy is uncertain, but you have your whole life ahead of you to find your path. \n\nThe right is teaching young conservatives to think that they have no control over the outside forces acting upon them. They’re taking a page straight out of the left’s playbook — so much so that Donald Trump seems to have taken a liking to Zohran Mamdani, the king of victimology.\n\nThe core message of the conservative movement used to be “you have agency.” This is the party of Ronald Reagan, who said in his 1967 Inaugural Address as Governor of California, “There is no humanity or charity in destroying self-reliance, and dignity and self-respect, the very substance of moral fiber.”\n\nUnfortunately, the right is starting to destroy the self-reliance of young people, insisting that the “elites” and the older generation are screwing them over — and playing straight into the hand of cranks like edge-lord podcaster Nick Fuentes who are eager to capitalize on misery.\n\n“The older generations have completely betrayed and sold out the youth,” Fuentes wrote on X earlier this month. “They have left us a ‘diversified’ s—t hole filled with foreigners, dominated by the Left, controlled by global special interests. And when young men stand up to fight, they scold us for being too edgy online.”\n\nIt’s not clear how Fuentes is materially standing up, other than fomenting hatred and taking his anger about his own life out on other groups of people. This is exactly what J.D. Vance warned against in his 2016 memoir “Hillbilly Elegy.”\n\n“The message of the right is increasingly: It’s not your fault if you’re a loser; it’s the government’s fault,” Vance wrote disapprovingly.\n\nTelling young people that you can fix their intractable problems is a clear path to votes. But robbing a generation of agency is a shortsighted route to societal stagnation.\n\nIt’s time to turn the message around. Shapiro, for his part, suggested the right should start delivering a new line: “You should actually pick your ass up and go out and do something useful.” He’s spot on.",

It was clear to me that the tide was moving in his favor.\n\nDespite all the hustle and bustle and robust capitalism of the place, New Yorkers have been moving to the left for decades. Cultural Marxism and its alliance with radical Islam are growing rapidly in the minds of more and more New Yorkers. (Read about the Red–Green alliance).\n\nAnd now, just like that other capital of the Anglosphere, London, New York has a Muslim mayor who is, in this case, an advocate of radical Shia Islam. We must expect arbitrary authoritarianism, masked as inclusivity, from his new government.\n\nNone of this should be surprising as Mamdani is a graduate of Bowdoin College, which was, not so long ago, one of America’s most prestigious and historic private liberal arts colleges.",

The visit drew much discussion from media personalities, as Mamdani and Trump have continuously shared their disdain for the other.\n\nIn addition, Mamdani opened up about how he started to gain attention from Americans during his October 2024 campaign, which he partly credited Trump for. During the early months of his campaign, he started interviewing Trump voters about why they voted for him after Trump was elected.\n\n“It just went back to cost of living and it went back to cheaper groceries, and that was a lot of our campaign,” Mamdani said of the responses.\n\nEarlier in the conversation, Mamdani also detailed what it was like visiting Trump, sharing that he was welcomed with a tour of White House’s Oval Office and the Cabinet Room, among other areas. \n\n“He showed me the portraits of all the presidents in the Cabinet Room,” Mamdani said. “The FDR (Franklin D. Roosevelt) was beautiful, and we talked about FDR for a little bit. And honestly, you don’t have the LaGuardia record if you don’t have FDR.”\n\nHe went on to say that while he was waiting for their official press meeting, he spotted an interesting piece of literature on one of the coffee tables. \n\n“In front of me are all these different coffee table books, and one of them is ‘UFC at the White House,’” Mamdani explained, who said he was unaware of the president’s plan to bring UFC fights to the White House, but he indulged nonetheless. “I had no idea, but I was flipping through that.”\n\nMamdani said that he has no plans to attend the potential event.",

        "text": "WORTHINGTON — The holidays are all about coming together with family and close friends, right? But what if this was turned on its head — what if it was about eating beside complete strangers?\n\nThis is exactly the goal that Gabriel Unger had in mind as he hosted a Friendsgiving celebration Monday night for the fourth year in a row in his expansive dance studio with raftered ceilings. Some 125 community members pitched in dishes and came bearing booze for the potluck event that was focused on separating from your spouse and family to make new friends and connections.\n\n“One thing that we really encourage is that everyone make a point to try and meet some people you haven’t met before. Say hello to people you haven’t met before and don’t be shy,” said Unger, as he invited people up to eat. “Just for this evening — you can live your life differently when you’re not here.”\n\nCommunity members understood the assignment.\n\nLevi Gershowitz of Plainfield was huddled in conversation with a Worthington couple, Kyle Dempsey and Ally Brown. From the outside they looked like friends of a decade or more, but in reality, “I just met them,” Gershowitz said.\n\n“I’ve been in the Hilltowns for almost 10 years now, and it feels like a library of people here,” he said. Dempsey and Brown, who make their money exclusively on social media sharing their Hilltown lifestyle for an audience of 1 million people, shared the same sentiment.\n\n“If you came here from a more populated town, you’d be like, ‘what are the residents like?’ And there’s such a mix of people who have been in this town their whole life that are old,” said Dempsey. “But then there’s people younger than us and it’s way more diverse than you would think.”\n\nGiven the “characters and legends” who attended, Dempsey said that, “If an apocalypse hit you’d want to be in this room.”\n\nFinn Carswell, who attends the Williston Northampton School, aspires to work in the fashion industry. He said it is often difficult to meet people outside one’s immediate circle, but on Monday he had luck and was able to connect with a lady involved in modeling.\n\nStrangers Matt DeVito and Italian author Andrea Villa, who is spending three months in town to focus on writing, sat next to each other over dinner.\n\n“I just met him. He’s a good guy though — an Italian,” said DeVito.\n\nMeanwhile Chris Ryan, who lives on the Chesterfield-Worthington line, called the night “a wonderful evening of community.”\n\nThe checklist to hold such a gathering includes people, food and a place to gather.\n\nCountless people praised Unger for hosting the night — like Vicky Dwight, who called him “the mayor of Worthington.” Dwight contributed her own part to the event and helped arrange furniture and sitting areas within the dance studio.\n\nHer daughter Isabel Dwight owed her mom some money. So instead of repaying she agreed to bartend for the night, regardless of the fact that she had no experience.\n\n“It’s important to encourage people to do this, especially during times where there is food insecurity, loneliness and isolation,” Isabel Dwight said, and added that rum and pineapple was the drink of choice.\n\nShe also shared her very concise inventory list needed to hold on events like these, saying that, “All we had was space and enough people to bring food.”\n\nLauren Cantalonis came with chips, guacamole and salsa and placed them on a 30-foot table that was loaded with food by other attendees. The table featured the essentials, turkey and all the fixings, as well as pasta dishes, potatoes, salads, appetizers, dips, desserts and a seemingly endless menu of other foods.\n\nOther volunteers laid out long tables decorated with artificial moss, votive candles and small accents. And outside, a fire pit was kept going, and people smoked their herbs of choice around it.\n\n(No) politics at the table\n\nUnger said for a gathering like this to be successful, people need to put neighbor ahead of ideology. He also believes that people aren’t as divided as social media would make it seem.\n\n“I think when we talk about our fractured climate, that’s what social media wants us to think,” he said. “I actually think we’re still talking to each other more than they want us to think we are.”\n\nAmillie Coster returned to the area, coming from Great Barrington where she works as a garden designer. She was having fun making a coded political statement for what could have been perceived as a party anthem.\n\nOn a floor to ceiling chalkboard at the entrance to the dance studio, she wrote in bold letters, “Turn the volume up,” the words Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said in his acceptance speech after winning the New York City mayoral election earlier this month.\n\n“The number one thing I ask for people to leave with tonight is that you can’t bring up politics at Thanksgiving … but you can be subliminal about it,” she said. “Just turn up the volume and it’s a dance party, so it works.”\n\nUnger got the idea to told these annual Friendsgiving celebrations from the co-owner of Lipton’s Bar and Restaurant in Worthington, Brigid Ryan. He also doesn’t want people to feel like gatherings like these are unique.\n\n“This is literally what happens in Alabama,” he said.",

We owe them the right tools.’\n\nJavaid Siddiqi at The Hill\n\nEnglish learner students are “capable of making multi-year academic gains in a single school year and represent some of the most motivated learners,” says Javaid Siddiqi. The “question isn’t whether they can succeed. It’s whether we’re equipping their teachers with the tools to help them.” Every “teacher should understand strategies to help students deconstruct texts. You can’t teach students who can’t access the reading.” The “problem is that most educator preparation programs don’t teach these strategies.”\n\n‘Is Queens the new political bellwether of America?’\n\nMichael Massing at The Guardian\n\nAs the “extraordinary Oval Office meeting” between President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani shows, “there’s a new bellwether in American politics,” says Michael Massing. Queens “contains multitudes. With a population of 2.3 million, it would be the nation’s fifth-largest city if it stood alone.” It is “thoroughly middle and working class — a swath of heartland America set down in pulsating, cosmopolitan New York.” Yet “national news organizations have treated the borough like flyover country.”\n\n‘Banning AI regulation will endanger American kids’ \n\nMichael Kleinman at Time\n\nDespite “horrific incident after horrific incident, AI companies retain carte blanche to sell products with zero meaningful safety standards or oversight,” says Michael Kleinman. No “other industry is given such freedom to endanger people with total impunity.” A “broad range of states including Utah, Texas, and California have already stepped up with important AI regulation that would be eviscerated by preemption.” This “dramatically limits the ability of states to enact commonsense regulations to protect our children.”\n\n‘The Nuzzi seizure of power’\n\nChris Lehmann at The Nation\n\nFuture “chronicles of the utter debasement of American political journalism will have to devote an entire chapter” to oral sex, says Chris Lehmann. This “salacious discourse comes off as positively quaint next to the revelations recounted by Beltway journalist Ryan Lizza in his serial Substack breakdown of the demise of his relationship with Olivia Nuzzi.” What “becomes clear across the dreary narrations” is “that all parties are in thrall to the act of portentous narration itself.”",

        "text": "Mayor-elect and self-proclaimed socialist Zohran Mamdani ran on a platform that included \"protecting\" city residents from possible deceptive information from pregnancy centers. \n\nBased on that assertion, one would think the pro-life community was out pestering every pregnant woman in Manhattan. You'd wonder if these rabid pro-lifers were just waiting to distribute red Handmaid's Tale-style robes to the unfortunate who crossed their path. \n\nYou might think that, listening to Mamdani. However, Feminists Choosing Life New York shows only 11 pregnancy care centers across the five boroughs of New York City. Residents have at least 45 options of in-person or telehealth abortion providers in the city. \n\nRev. Jim Harden, the CEO of Compass Care, which runs three of those pro-life medical pregnancy centers in Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island, shared his fears about the mayor's statements in an op-ed for LifeNews: \"Mamdani's campaign trail threats notwithstanding, what can pro-life Christian pregnancy centers realistically expect from Mayor Mamdani? The answer all depends on which of Mamdani’s fundamentalisms shows up for work. Either one is lethal to America’s Constitutional Rule of Law, rooted in Judeo-Christian beliefs, beliefs that are the basis for pro-life words and work in the public square.\" \n\nDuring his run, Mamdani's team issued a \"Trump-Proofing NYC\" Google doc position paper that includes a section devoted to \"defending reproductive rights.\" The document asserted: \n\nThe Mamdani administration will protect New Yorkers from false or deceptive information spread by Crisis Pregnancy Centers, including lies about abortion safety and medications, and enforce Local Law 17 forcing these centers to disclose whether they have licensed medical professionals. It will also strengthen the city’s Abortion Access Hub by doubling funding to $2M, which confidentially helps New Yorkers find abortion providers and supports people living outside of New York through the process of scheduling appointments and finding financial assistance. It will also double funding to the New York Abortion Access Fund, which will provide essential funding to ensure New Yorkers get the medical care they need as New Yorkers face cuts to Medicaid.\n\nHarden also questioned the way that Mamdani will strengthen Local Law 17. He noted that rules about notifications will force pregnancy centers to add cumbersome language in large fonts to advertisements, which may include \"a list of what we do not provide, such as abortion, to a phone number referring women to an abortionist.\"\n\nThe three centers in New York City, along with others that Compass Care runs across the state, offer services including pregnancy testing and ultrasounds, STD testing and treatment, abortion pill reversal, and after-abortion care. Theirs is the only organization in the city that does not have a profit motive in encouraging women to abort. \n\nHarden's organization is already fighting a lawsuit from New York Attorney Letitia James, New York City, and New York State. If it is this difficult to stay in business and offer pro-life counselling and services now, what will women in crisis do after Mamdani is inaugurated in January?\n\nNow is the BEST time to subscribe to PJ Media.

Are you sure that’s a good idea, guys?\"\n\nBurns went on to suggest Trump simply \"doesn't care about doing his job\" and that the splits within the GOP are not just because of disagreements on policy, but because of the president's \"apathy\" to his position of power. \n\nThe columnist added, \"America has suffered through bad presidents before, but we’ve rarely been cursed with a president who simply doesn’t care about doing the job. Trump’s overwhelming apathy has created power vacuums across every part of our government, and his band of grifting loyalists are rushing in to steal what they can while the boss is clocked out.\"\n\n\"This isn’t a model of effective government, it’s a blueprint for collapse. What a perfect description for the vapid, lazy mess Trump’s MAGA agenda has become.\" \n\nTrump remains an unpredictable president in his second term, with insiders reportedly shocked to find he had warmed to New York City mayoral elect, Zohran Mamdani. The meeting between the democratic socialist and president went surprisingly well for the soon-to-be NYC mayor. \n\nBut for Trump, Michael Wolff says it couldn't have gone worse. Wolff suggested the president's plan had been to be tough but instead Trump looked as though he was won over by the Democratic socialist during their Oval Office press conference. \n\nThe slip up from Trump, who had reportedly been set to be tough on Mamdani only to say he and the NYC mayoral elect agreed on several issues, has made some insiders \"shiver\", The Daily Beast reported.",

If you enjoy their collaboration, email them at yrodriguez@cleveland.com, ldaprile@cleveland.com.\n\nDear Yadi and Lucas: The next few months are going to be difficult for me. With the holidays come family gatherings. I love my family, but they always make comments on what I eat. I am in my 20s and an adult.\n\nMy weight has fluctuated my entire life; I have always been one of the larger people in my family. And my family always comments on my weight and what I eat at family gatherings.\n\nIt has gotten to the point where I hesitate to go. It feels like I’m being watched the entire time, and I worry about someone seeing me eat this or that. I have even eaten before going so that I don’t have to worry about being hungry while there, but then I get yelled at for not eating.\n\nI’m in a no-win situation. How do I attend family gatherings without being constantly scrutinized for eating or not eating?\n\nDear Reader: There are some people in this world who are emotionally well-adjusted enough to have a conversation with you about why that would hurt your feelings. However, I don’t imagine the people going out of their way to embarrass you at a family gathering are those people. \n\nIn that case, you’re perfectly justified in terrorizing your relatives.\n\nAvoiding politics at the dinner table has become a cliche in the Tr*mp era, so mentioning ICE or Zohran Mamdani (make sure you mispronounce it) will surely go over as well as smoking cigarettes inside an orphanage. \n\nWhile your uncles fight over who can be the most racist and your cousin hides in the bathroom, you can sit back and enjoy your green bean casserole in peace.\n\nIf you’ve been taking care of your mental health and aren’t up to date on politics, I understand. There are other ways to ruin everyone else’s holiday. \n\nBefore the turkey is carved, pick it up, jam your head through the cavity and wear it like a mask. Pretend to be a pilgrim and do silly little dances, amusing the young nieces and nephews. As the heat from the overcooked turkey scorches your face and you bumble around the kitchen, colliding with the walls and screaming about how horrible of an idea this all was, your relatives will back off. \n\nNot only will they finally see how funny you are, they will also realize that if they want to eat at all, they better stay on your good side. \n\nREAD Yadi’s take here.\n\nPrevious Ask Lucas/Ask Yadi collaborations",

Does he have some work to do still in winning over the support of first responders in New York?”\n\nTucker simply responded Mamdani “has a tremendous amount of work to do and I think it’s work well worth doing” and even though he “respect[s]” Tisch for staying on, “I know she respects me for my decision to leave.”\n\nDokoupil then asked Tucker straight up if he’s resigning because he’s Jewish: “To what extent is this decision of yours about being a Jewish new Yorker?”\n\n“Yeah, I think it’s a factor, no doubt, and I don’t want to tell you that it’s the only factor, but I believe that the things that I have heard the mayor say would make it difficult for me to continue on in – in such a senior executive role in the administration,” Tucker explained, remaining vague while also leaving little doubt to those who could read between the lines.\n\nDokoupil then outlined how Tucker has not been alone in feeling concern for their ability to be Jewish in New York under someone who’s voiced an “opposition to Israel as a Jewish state.”\n\nTo this, Tucker further emphasized he and Mamdani would have “very fundamental things” they would disagree on if he were to have stayed (click “expand”):\n\nDOKOUPIL: Mamdani’s political rise has been taken as an ominous sign by many Jewish leaders –\n\nRABBI ANGELA BUCHDAHL: Zohran Mamdani has contributed to a mainstreaming of some of the most abhorrent anti-Semitism.\n\nDOKOUPIL: – who point to, among other things, his opposition to Israel as a Jewish state.\n\nTUCKER: Look, it’s a complicated, emotional decision to leave, but ideologically there’s no doubt that the mayor and I disagree on some very fundamental things to me.\n\nTucker specifically cited Mamdani’s callous response to the gang of thugs congregating around and blocking entrance to the Park East Synagogue on November 19 that Dokoupil explained for the uninitiated:\n\nIn a protest last week outside a synagogue hosting an event to support Jewish immigration to Israel, activists shouted threats. A Mamdani spokesperson was later quoted saying he “discouraged the language,” adding, in an apparent nod of support to the protesters, that “these sacred spaces should not be used to promote activities in violation of international law.”\n\nTucker said “I don’t know that the public has heard appropriately from him” and, for those that did see his response, Tucker opined Mamdani “could have come out very quickly and condemned the behavior and some of the rhetoric,” but he didn’t.\n\nThe interview came to a close with this remarkable admission from Tucker that he has received no communication from Mamdani and his team:\n\nI haven’t had any personal conversations with the mayor-elect, I haven’t heard from anyone in his incoming administration nor has the department and so, I only hope that – that that is not an indicator of their feelings about the FDNY. I’d like to think they think everything is going so well here that they don’t need to transition so fast.\n\nBack live, Dokoupil concluded by emphasizing Tucker “loves his job” and “the people he is working with in general,” so this “was clearly an emotion and personal decision.” Despite his resignation, Dokoupil added, Tucker “is wishing Mamdani all the best, all the success in the world.”\n\nGoing to break, Dokoupil blurted out that he too has received no response from Mamdani and his team: “Oh, wait, I should add we asked the Mamdani campaign for comment. We did not hear back. So, yeah.”\n\nTo see the relevant CBS transcript from November 26, click here.",

        "text": "Councilmember Julie Menin, who represents the Upper East Side, said Wednesday she has secured enough support to be the City Council's next speaker. \n\nMenin is seen as a moderate who could serve as a check on Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s progressive policies. The speaker is the second-most powerful elected official in city government, with control over which legislation gets brought up for votes. The speaker also negotiates the city’s budget of around $120 billion.\n\nMenin is reportedly skeptical of Mamdani’s plan for a new Department of Community Safety that would dispatch social workers to certain mental health emergencies, rather than the NYPD. Like Mamdani, Menin has broad support from influential unions.\n\n“I am honored and humbled by the trust and faith that my colleagues have put in me to lead the City Council as a force of action for New York families,” Menin said in a statement declaring she had secured the votes of 36 of her colleagues. The Council has 51 members.\n\nHer office did not provide a list of members who had committed their support ahead of the January 7 vote. A spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for the list. \n\nThe speaker’s race is seen as a test of an incoming mayor’s political capital. Previous mayors have tried to influence the outcome by lobbying members of the Council to pick a preferred candidate. Mayor Bill de Blasio handpicked his ally Melissa Mark-Viverito during his first term. In 2021, Mayor Eric Adams unsuccessfully waded into the race by lobbying for Queens councilmember and moderate Democrat Francisco Moya. The race was eventually won by Adrienne Adams, who battled with the mayor over the budget and legislation.\n\nMamdani has not yet publicly weighed in on the race.\n\nMenin served as the city’s director of the 2020 census, when New York officials feared Trump administration interference would result in an undercount.\n\nCouncilmember Crystal Hudson, who represents parts of Brooklyn, is also vying for the speaker role. She did not respond to an inquiry.\n\nMenin’s Council district went for former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the mayoral election. Hudson’s backed Mamdani.\n\nThe Council is expected to vote for the next speaker on Jan. 7.",

        "text": "Total falsehoods: \"I want for people to recognize a great job that I've done on pricing, on affordability, because we brought prices way down,\" said President Donald Trump on Monday. (The White House released a semi-propagandistic fact sheet that same day to bolster the president's talking points, as all White Houses do at one time or another.)\n\n\"We are doing better than we've ever done as a country. Prices are coming down and all of that stuff,\" he said the week before. \"And you know, they talk about different terms for that, but I will tell you that nobody has done what we've done in terms of pricing.\"\n\n\"Walmart just announced that the cost of their standard Thanksgiving meal is reduced by 25 percent this year from last year,\" Trump said recently, failing to account for the fact that the price change is due to Walmart…changing the goods offered via their Thanksgiving meal bundle (and drastically shrinking its size) to get prices lower for cost-burdened consumers.\n\n\"Since January 2025, the Consumer Price Index has ranged between 3.3 percent and 2.7 percent,\" writes National Review's Jim Geraghty. \"That's much better than the worst days of the Biden administration in 2022, but that's also roughly where it was for Biden's final year in office.\"\n\nBut Trump, ever a salesman, recognizes which messages are winning for other politicians: It's affordability season, and you've gotta appeal to people's bottom lines if you want to be taken seriously right now.\n\nThe Free Press' related entry into this discourse is rather interesting, albeit wrong: \"The poverty line, a six-decade-old benchmark, claims to define the threshold to the middle class,\" writes Michael W. Green. \"The number is a lie.\"\n\nGreen goes on to promote the idea that a household income of $100,000 is \"the new poverty\"; that the reason the affordability messaging is so salient is because even households that look well-off on paper are actually struggling to make ends meet; that the ways we measure poverty and economic struggle are way outdated.\n\n\"In 1963, Mollie Orshansky, an economist at the Social Security Administration, observed that families spent roughly one-third of their income on groceries,\" writes Green. \"Since pricing data was hard to come by for many items (e.g., housing), if you could calculate a minimum adequate food budget at the grocery store, you could multiply by three and establish a poverty line. Orshansky presented her findings in 1965. She was drawing a floor, a line below which families were clearly in crisis.\" (This is not totally correct; the actual story of how the poverty line was calculated is a bit more complex.)\n\n\"For that time, that floor made sense,\" continues Green. \"Housing was relatively cheap. A family could rent a decent apartment or buy a home on a single income. Healthcare was provided by employers and cost relatively little (Blue Cross coverage cost in the range of $10 per month). Childcare didn't really exist as a market—mothers stayed home, family helped, or neighbors (who likely had someone home) watched each others' kids. Cars were affordable, if prone to breakdowns. College tuition could be covered with a summer job.\" Today, argues Green, the labor market has transformed, requiring two earners, not one—and thus child care expenses (for families that end up having kids, which is to say: not everyone). Housing is a larger share of the monthly household budget. Ditto for health care. \"If you keep Orshansky's logic—if you maintain her principle that poverty could be defined by the inverse of food's budget share—but update the food share to reflect today's reality, the multiplier is no longer three,\" argues Green. \"It becomes 16. Which means if you measured income inadequacy today the way Orshansky measured it in 1963, the threshold for a family of four—the official poverty line in 2024—wouldn't be $31,200. If the crisis threshold—the floor below which families cannot function—is honestly updated to current spending patterns, it lands at close to $140,000.\"\n\n\"The idea that over time we should dynamically multiply a food budget by the inverse of food's share of the budget to get the poverty line is laughable,\" argues American Enterprise Institute's Scott Winship. \"Engel's law says that as societies grow richer, the food share of the budget falls. But by Green's logic, the richest possible society is really the poorest. If we got the food share down to 1% of household budgets, we'd need to multiply the food budget by 99 instead of Green's 16. This multiplier is actually a measure of a society's affluence!\"\n\nI'm persuaded by Winship's argument that this model is bad and I think Green's argument sells short the massive quality-of-life gains we've had since the '60s. Success and stability, to my mind, are not defined solely by material objects. But at the same time, the fact that pretty much all of us have little tiny supercomputers in our pockets that connect us to infinite reserves of knowledge (and to each other) is a vast improvement. The fact that household goods are cheap and easy to come by is no small thing (even though we sometimes trick ourselves into believing durability is suffering, when nowadays, a lot of the time, the cost of repair is higher than the cost of replacing). Sure, a lot of people are wasting $150,000 (or more) on educations that, well, maybe they could've gotten for \"$1.50 in late fees at the public library\"—but isn't it a huge boon to self-starters everywhere that you don't even need to go to the public library anymore to access that type of knowledge? The worldwide web is a gift to us all (if only we'd stop mainlining 60-second vertical videos).\n\nAt the same time, despite his bad model and questionable portrayal of history, Green is correct to identify housing, child care, health care, and education costs as areas that have not gotten better over time to the degree that many of us had hoped. These are extreme pain points for many Americans, particularly for those who find themselves too rich for welfare, but too poor to be able to have much margin. (\"Our entire safety net is designed to catch people at the very bottom,\" writes Green, accurately, \"but it sets a trap for anyone trying to climb out.\")\n\nIt's easy to say issues like housing are only bad in large metro areas, not the rest of the country, but roughly 20 percent of the U.S. population lives in a large metro area (20 million in New York, 13 million in L.A., 9 million in Chicago, 8 million apiece in Dallas and Houston). Six percent of the U.S. population lives within the New York metro area alone. And it is a good thing for people to care about agglomeration effects and to want to go where the jobs are, to be upwardly mobile and thus geographically mobile; if the price to doing so is incurring massive housing costs, one response is that those tradeoffs are natural and part of life. Another response is that we're disincentivizing people who would otherwise be highly productive workers, that we're making it costlier for them to pursue the most productive use of their time and talent.\n\nIt's the same story with child care expenses. There's no way around the fact that child care requires lots of human labor. But most localities have heaped on burdensome regulations and degree requirements that make it even harder and more expensive to hire competent workers and maintain licensed facilities. One answer to this is for families to have only one earner during the young-kid years, not two; but this comes at great cost to future earnings, and it can be easier to enter and exit at will in some industries than in others. The young-kid years are relatively short (especially as family sizes shrink), but it's not crazy for families in larger metro areas to feel hit rather hard by the dual needs of child care and housing.\n\nPerhaps the greatest issue with Green's writing is that he confuses \"poverty\" and \"economic strain.\" It is very possible that dual-earner households making six figures feel economic strain from high child care, housing, and health care costs. But feeling encumbered by tradeoffs is rather different than being poor. We should allow these words to retain their meanings. Affordability discourse is useless if it's not accurate, and every politician and pundit should strive to accurately describe Americans' financial realities, not inflate or exaggerate hardship to serve a particular political agenda.\n\nMost of the time, politicians will offer one solution and one solution only: the warm embrace of the state to alleviate people's financial woes. In reality, getting the state the hell out of the way would help bring down prices in most of the categories people cite as the ones giving them the most trouble.\n\nScenes from New York: Incoming mayor Zohran Mamdani has asked 179 Eric Adams staffers to resign from their City Hall posts. Mamdani \"has already named Dean Fuleihan, a longtime government hand, as his first deputy mayor and has retained the police commissioner, Jessica Tisch,\" reports The New York Times. His longtime top aide, Elle Bisgaard-Church, will serve as his chief of staff. (\"Ursulina Ramirez, who helped lead Bill de Blasio's transition in 2013, said Mr. Mamdani's housecleaning was reminiscent of Mr. de Blasio's after he succeeded Michael R. Bloomberg,\" per the Times.)\n\nHappy Thanksgiving! Look, I like politics, but what I really like is PIE. DM me/email me/sound off in the comments section about the most important issue of all: Which pies are you baking/eating tomorrow? I always make the GoHo, a recipe I adapted from Martha Stewart and have made dozens of times over the years, with elements of pecan but a little more sophistication than your standard pecan-and-corn-syrup getup. This year I am also experimenting with a cranberry curd tart (think tarte au citron but a little tangier, with a delicate hazelnut crust) and a maple chess pie with coffee whipped cream. And, in the spirit of the holiday, let me also mention: I am so deeply grateful for each person who takes time out of their busy day to read this newsletter. I hope it leaves you better informed and even makes you chuckle every once in a while. Cheers to freedom and to pie!\n\"My therapist always asks me to transcribe my dreams and the recurring dream I've had is standing up in a cafeteria full of women and saying 'I don't want children. I want power!'\" said Tennessee state representative Aftyn Behn on a recent podcast. And indeed, power she seeks: Behn is running to represent Tennessee's 7th congressional district and replace U.S. Rep. Mark Green, a Republican, in a special election that will be held on December 2. Maybe it's just me, but any politician who is so blatant about wanting power immediately rubs me the wrong way. Behn should want to improve the lives of her constituents. It is uncouth to say the quiet part out loud!\nThis Jonathan Haidt piece is actually just a rehashing of The Screwtape Letters.\nBlack Friday purchases as a recession indicator?\nGavin Newsom better become a bit more pro-tech mighty fast:\n\nIt's true that California's economy grew under Newsom, but it has also become a one-trick pony.

        "text": "About five years ago, the comedian Ryan Long posted a video in which a woke progressive and an old-fashioned racist meet and, much to their astonishment, discover that rather than being bitterly opposed, they agree on pretty much everything.\n\nThere was a strong echo of that convergence in last week's White House tete-a-tete between Republican President Donald Trump and New York's new socialist Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. Anticipated to be a grudge match, it instead turned into something of a lovefest. Well, of course it did. As fans of horseshoe theory accurately point out, control freaks from the political extremes might differ on details, but they have more in common with each other than they do with people who respect each other's liberty.\n\nTrump and Mamdani in 'a Place of Shared Admiration and Love'\n\nIn reporting on the meeting, The Hill noted, \"Trump and Mamdani answered questions from reporters, both striking a remarkably cordial tone, with the president indicating he agreed with many of the mayor-elect's ideas.\"\n\nAccording to Mamdani, \"It was a productive meeting focused on a place of shared admiration and love.\"\n\nTrump added that Mamdani would be \"hopefully a really great mayor.\" He also commented, \"There's no difference in party. There's no difference in anything.\"\n\nSo, how did two politicians who entered the meeting slinging epithets at each other like \"communist\" and \"fascist\" exit with the makings of a mutual admiration society? There's a hint in a question a BBC reporter posed to the new mayor at the White House when he commented \"you're both populist\" and asked, \"to what extent the president's campaign…inspired any part of your campaign?\"\n\nMamdani eagerly brought up cost-of-living and economic concerns while Trump nodded and then chimed in with agreement about concerns over the price of energy.\n\nThat's the key to this meeting of the minds. Trump and Mamdani are strongly focused on economic issues. They also share a taste for addressing those concerns with government direction.\n\nTwo Paths to Socialism\n\nMamdani boasts of his open socialism. He's gone so far as to call for \"seizing the means of production.\" He won office with a campaign that promised city-run grocery stores, a rent freeze, and free buses, child care, and other services funded by higher taxes on whoever can be interpreted as \"wealthy.\" That should be interesting since he wants to tax the extremely wealthy out of existence.\n\nIn an exercise of what can be called \"Republican socialism,\" Trump actually did seize a portion of the means of production when his administration leaned on U.S. Steel for a \"golden share\" of the company. Under his leadership, the federal government has also taken ownership positions in firms including Intel, Lithium Americas, and Trilogy Metals. Trump's protectionism is crafted to enable the state to push firms to revive domestic manufacturing—or else.\n\nMamdani believes in government control of the economy for the sake of achieving socialism. Trump endorses government control of the economy to accomplish his nationalist goals. But whatever they call their views, both men think political leaders should be directing economic activity.\n\nWhat brought Mamdani to socialism is probably best left as a question for his shrink, his parents, and his college professors. But Trump's path to state control of the economy almost certainly lies in his nationalist impulses. He came to office on the slogan \"Make America Great Again\" and has enthusiastically used the power of the federal government to enact what he believes that means, often replacing individual choice with politicians' preferences.\n\nAs the economist Friedrich Hayek wrote in his 1960 book, The Constitution of Liberty, \"It is this nationalistic bias which frequently provides the bridge from conservatism to collectivism. To think in terms of 'our' industry or resource is only a short step away from demanding that these national assets be directed in the national interest.\"\n\nHayek differentiated nationalism from patriotism, which he considered pride in your origins as opposed to nationalism's collectivism and xenophobia. The shared collectivism of socialism and nationalism, he added, is why \"we frequently find the conservatives joining hands with the socialists against the liberals.\"\n\nInevitably Shared Authoritarianism\n\nWhether collectivist economic impulses are exercised by nationalists or by socialists, Hayek observed that the result is inevitably authoritarian. When the state controls economic activity, it can deny permits, withhold resources, cut off finance, impose punitive taxes, and otherwise make existence independent of the state almost impossible.\n\n\"Economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends,\" Hayek warned in his 1944 book, The Road to Serfdom. \"And whoever has sole control of the means must also determine which ends are to be served, which values are to be rated higher and which lower, in short, what men should believe and strive for.\"\n\nFrom different directions, Trump and Mamdani have arrived at agreement that economic activity should be directed by government officials over the objections of those who want to make their own decisions about their property, their businesses, and their money. They got along so well together at the White House because, like Ryan Long's fictional wokester and racist, they were delighted to discover the similarities in their desires for a society controlled from the top.\n\nYes, Mamdani is back to calling Trump a \"fascist,\" but there's a quality of rote recital to it. He's giving his supporters what they expect. Trump will probably call him a communist again. But they're not bitter enemies; the two men are rivals peddling similar products and vying for market share.\n\nHolding Onto Individualism\n\nIn opposition to both these representatives of neighboring arms of the ideological horseshoe are Hayek-style classical liberals, libertarians, and other individualists. Advocates of liberty oppose collectivism and state control whether it's called socialism, nationalism, or some other name. We see society as a cooperative endeavor among free individuals, not as a collective to be commanded from above.\n\nUnfortunately, Mamdani and Trump represent political movements that are consuming their respective political parties. If they're successful in displacing the remaining relatively individualistic voices, the political choices offered in the future by the major parties will be nothing more than competing brands of collectivism. Of course, collectivists favor a world in which choices are made for us.",

        "text": "For the first time, FDNY Commissioner Robert S. Tucker is explaining why he decided to announce his resignation just one day after Zohran Mamdani won the New York City mayoral race.\"Look, it's a complicated, emotional decision to leave. But ideologically, there's no doubt that the mayor and I disagree on some very fundamental things to me,\" Tucker, who was appointed to the role in August 2024, told \"CBS Mornings\" in his first interview since handing in his resignation letter on Nov. 5.In a closely-watched decision last week, Tucker's police counterpart, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch accepted Mamdani's offer to stay in her role. Months before the election, Mamdani softened his sharp criticism of the NYPD and clarified that he is \"not running to defund the police,\" distancing himself from old social media posts.Despite his public apology to the NYPD, Tucker said Mamdani still has some work to do when it comes to winning over the support of first responders. Beyond that, some of Mamdani's stances, like his refusal to support Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, have alarmed many Jewish New Yorkers.\"I think it's a factor [in my decision to resign], no doubt,\" said Tucker, who is Jewish. \"And I don't want to tell you that it's the only factor. But I believe that the things that I have heard the mayor say would make it difficult for me to continue on in such a senior executive role in the administration.\"According to exit polls, 31% of Jewish New Yorkers voted for Mamdani, with 65% voting for independent opponent Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani won every borough but Staten Island.In an October debate, Mamdani, who will make history as New York City's first Muslim mayor, vowed to \"be the mayor who doesn't just protect Jewish New Yorkers, but also celebrates and cherishes them.\"However, Tucker and some prominent Jewish leaders – like Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, the senior rabbi at New York City's Central Synagogue – aren't convinced by the mayor-elect's words of reassurance. In an October sermon, Buchdal accused Mamdani of contributing \"to a mainstreaming of some of the most abhorrent antisemitism.\"\"More importantly than hearing it, we want to see it,\" Tucker said.He pointed to Mamdani's response to a protest last week outside of an Upper East Side synagogue hosting an event to support Jewish emigration to Israel, during which activists shouted threats. A Mamdani spokesperson was later quoted saying he \"discouraged the language,\" adding in an apparent nod of support to the protesters that \"these sacred spaces should not be used to promote activities in violation of international law.\"Tucker said Mamdani should have come out quickly to condemn the behavior and rhetoric.\"You know, I don't know that the public has heard appropriately from him,\" he said.Inside headquarters in Brooklyn, where the FDNY coordinates responses to emergencies across America's biggest city, Tucker says they're still waiting for outreach from Mamdani.\"I haven't had any personal conversations with the mayor-elect. I haven't heard from anyone in his incoming administration, nor has the department. And so I only hope that is not an indicator of their feelings about the FDNY. I'd like to think they think everything is going so well here that they don't need to transition so fast,\" he joked.Mamdani and his team have not responded to CBS News' requests for comment on this story.",

        "text": "The wife of Trump henchman Stephen Miller lashed out at MSNBC veteran Joy Reid over comments Reid made about JD Vance’s marriage to second lady Usha. \n\nDuring a fiery segment on The Ingraham Angle, Katie Miller, a former Trump White House aide turned podcaster, erupted after Reid suggested Vance was pandering to a base she described as “fundamentally racist.”\n\nReid’s appearance on the I’ve Had It podcast, where she argued it would be a “MAGA fairytale” for Vance to ditch his Indian-American wife, Usha Vance, for “a white woman.”\n\nThe remark ricocheted across conservative media—and landed squarely in Laura Ingraham’s lap.\n\n“RACIST REID STRIKES AGAIN,” was the message the Fox News chyron blasted into the homes of millions of Americans. \n\n“Over on The View, Joy Reid is already attacking JD Vance and Vance’s wife. Watch,” Ingraham told viewers before rolling the clip. While the podcast’s hosts, Jennifer Welch and Angie Sullivan, have appeared on The View, their podcast is not expressly linked to the show.\n\nReid, who has also appeared on The View but isn’t a regular, didn’t mince words. “They can’t have the successor MAGA to be a brown and Hindu wife... He is throwing his wife under the bus, poor Usha, or she is in on it.”\n\nIngraham then brought in Miller, 34, who served as deputy press secretary during President Donald Trump’s first administration, who promptly flipped the racism accusation back on Democrats. “I think the only racists here are those in the Democratic Party and those who exist on MS NOW, whatever that is, MS DNC,” Miller snapped. She insisted Vance “does it with such praise and devotion in his heart” whenever he talks about his wife and called the scrutiny of their relationship “disgusting” and “gross.”\n\n“And all they have left to do is these deranged identity-based attacks,” she continued, claiming Democrats resort to personal smears because “they don’t have any platforms to run on.”\n\nThe melodrama comes as the Vances confront a string of viral, marriage-themed mini-scandals. The furor mutated earlier this week when the vice president visited Camp Lejeune in North Carolina with first lady Melania Trump and was photographed without his wedding ring. The images ballooned into online theories about marital trouble—preceded by an earlier controversy involving the widow of Charlie Kirk.\n\nAt a Turning Point USA event in Mississippi, Erika Kirk introduced Vance in a moment that instantly caught fire online. “No one will ever replace my husband,” she said of the conservative activist, who was murdered on Sept. 10, while speaking on a college campus in Utah. But she added, “I do see some similarities… in Vice President JD Vance.” Their subsequent embrace—Erika clutching his head while his hands drifted into her hip zone—only fueled more gossip.\n\nThe Vances married in 2014 after meeting at Yale Law School and share three children: Ewan, 8, Vivek, 5, and Mirabel, 3. And while the vice president has stayed publicly silent through the cascading speculation, a spokesperson for Vance chose to address the saga.\n\nMiller, meanwhile, is partial to an on-air meltdown. Last month, she erupted during a heated panel debate on Piers Morgan Uncensored. The panel was supposed to discuss then-New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s comments that Islamophobia is “endemic” in the country. Instead, Miller accused everyone of antisemitism and threatened to walk off the show and never return.",

And as FAA administrator Sean Duffy encourages Americans to don their finest formal wear in anticipation of their voyaging, perhaps it’s worth strapping on your corset and/or cummerbund as we take a Day-Before-Thanksgiving tour of our shared destination. Because wherever American families gather, this year, their location will be the same: Crazy Town. \n\nWe can all agree on that.\n\nAn astronaut and combat pilot is being investigated by the “Department of War” for instructing members of the military to follow the law. \n\nA Russian-authored “peace plan” which gives Vladimir Putin everything he wants in exchange for, essentially, Ukrainian surrender, is being touted as official American policy. \n\nAnd speaking of the former Soviet Union, at the same time the United States government is bashing the “communist” mayor-elect of New York City Zohran Mamdani, they’re snapping up ownership stakes in private companies, which is a helluva lot closer to actual communism. To paraphrase a Katy Perry song of a certain vintage, after their Oval Office meet-cute, Trump kissed a Pinko—and he liked it. \n\nThere’s the idiocy of our current tariff situation, in which the president staked the American economy on a plan to tax the hell out of everybody, but mostly the American public. The result: prices are up despite the White House’s failed attempts to massage those Walmart “Thanksgiving meal” numbers—and people are pissed. To rectify the situation, the administration is now selectively removing tariffs from random products; the party of free trade is now reaching into the American economy and instituting what amounts to price controls on certain goods and services.\n\nNot that I think Trump and his ilk are closet Reds any more than I think they’re closet humanitarians. Instead, the headlines we’re seeing point to something worse than a full Marxist takeover of the American government. Marxism, at least, has an animating ideal. \n\nOne of the many problems with installing an amoral doofus without a coherent governing philosophy at the helm of the world’s richest and mightiest nation is that such a person will then behave as an amoral doofus without a coherent governing philosophy.\n\nWhat follows is what we see: a disparate hodgepodge of ad hoc, often contradictory policy positions which leave the nation uncertain and vulnerable. The reason, for example, Covid-19 hit us so hard wasn’t just because we were dealing with a novel pathogen, but we were doing at the same time we were dealing with said amoral doofus discarding an entire playbook—one literally titled “Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological Incidents”—designed to deal with a future epidemiological nightmare Oopsie! And that was when we still had competent people like Dr. Anthony Fauci heading most of our federal agencies. Imagine the response to a future pandemic if RFK Jr. is in charge. Horse paste for everyone!\n\nSpeaking of which: If those high food costs have you trimming your turkey budget, I bet you could get some high-quality horsemeat on the cheap. Spread a little Ivermectin and pesticide on there and you’ve got yourself a delicious spin on the traditional open-faced leftover sandwich! \n\nA government powered by spite is unlikely to be a government that inspires confidence. Poll after poll screams “danger,” showing the administration on the same glidepath as the UPS plane that crashed in Kentucky last week. Sure, it got off the ground but not for long. That’s kind of where we find ourselves approaching the one-year mark of the second Burger King administration, a nation hurtling disaster, and the American public knows it.\n\nOne thing about data sets; they tend to return to the mean. After the executive order blitzkrieg of his first several months in office, orders which had Trump’s political opponents scrambling, the opposition appears to have found some footing. The judiciary (sans the nakedly partisan Supreme Court) is leading the way, with the Trump administration losing most of the cases it brings. \n\nCitizens have mobilized. Elections are being held and, just like last time, Republicans are being unceremoniously dumped from office. Former allies like Marjorie Taylor Greene are breaking for the exits. And yesterday, we learned that, with eight months still to run on its charter, DOGE is now no more. (The agency did tweet yesterday that it’s still around, but my sources say that was just Big Balls roaming around the empty offices looking for an accountant to fire.) While DOGE may have failed to eliminate any “waste, fraud, and abuse” it did succeed in eliminating an incalculable number of human lives. I mean that literally—it’s impossible to calculate the true scale of deaths that eliminating USAID and other programs caused.\n\nThe president, too, has returned to his own meanness. Not that it ever went away. Gone is the triumphal preening of his first 100 days, the arrogance of the dressing down of Zelenskyy in the Oval Office replaced with a mortifying “Quiet, piggy” to a female reporter in the back of Air Force One. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight despite the turbulence. And do try to ignore the ground rushing up to greet us. \n\nHappy Thanksgiving.",

        "text": "President Donald Trump spent some time at the presidential turkey pardoning to mention prices going down, but polls show voters aren't giving him a stamp of approval on the economy just yet.\n\nBefore the week of Thanksgiving, Trump had a standout week with an eyebrow-raising meeting with New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. The two men from Queens discussed affordability in a friendly meeting on Nov. 21 despite their political differences.\n\nTrump has also wanted to reclaim winning on the economy, like mentioning on Nov. 25 Walmart's Thanksgiving meal bundle being 25% less expensive than last year (though it has fewer items).\n\nSome voters put the economy as the most important factor in how they judge Trump. What is Trump's approval rating? See the recent polls:\n\nEric Trump reveals moment: What did Barron Trump tell Biden at the inauguration?\n\nWhat is Trump's approval rating?\n\nAverages based on RealClearPolitics and New York Times aggregators show Trump's approval rating is net negative, and after months of being relatively stable, has dropped in over the last month.\n\nAs of Jan. 27, 50.5% approved, giving Trump a net positive rating until March 13, when it flipped to net negative with 47.8% approval, compared to 48.5% disapproval, RealClearPolitics graphics show. The approval rating reached a low on April 29 at 45.1% approval, which fell around Trump's 100-day mark. It reached a new low of 42.3% on Nov. 14, as the controversy on Jeffrey Epstein's emails heated up following the end of the government shutdown. As of Nov. 25, 43% approve and 54.8% disapprove.\n\nThe New York Times aggregator showed Trump's approval fell from 52% approval in January to 44% approval in April, and then mostly held steady for months. According to the Times, Trump's term low is 41% approval, which he first reached on Nov. 12. His disapproval also notched up to 56% on Nov. 19, a high for this term per the aggregator.\n\nHow does President Donald Trump's approval rating compare to past presidents?\n\nIn a Gallup poll conducted from Oct. 1-16, 41% approved of Trump's job performance, up slightly from the previous month.\n\nA historical analysis by Gallup shows Trump's approval ratings in October of his first years in office − both as the 45th and 47th presidents − are lower than any other modern president at the same time in their administrations. Here is how his October approval compares to other presidents in October of their first year of their term, according to Gallup:\n\nJoe Biden (October 2021) - 42% approveTrump (October 2017) - 37% approveBarack Obama (October 2009) - 53% approveGeorge W. Bush (October 2001) - 88% approveBill Clinton (October 1993) - 48% approveGeorge H.W. Bush (October 1989) - 68% approveRonald Reagan (October 1981) - 55% approve\n\nCBS News: 60% of Americans say Trump makes the economy sound better than it is\n\nIn a CBS News/YouGov poll conducted Nov. 19-21, Trump received a 40% approval rating. The survey included 2,489 U.S. adults with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points.\n\nWhen asked how Trump makes things sound in regard to prices and inflation, 60% said he makes them sound better than they really are, compared to 27% who responded he makes them sound about as they are, and 13% who said worse, according to CBS. Respondents were also most likely to say the economy and inflation are the most important things when judging the Trump administration.\n\nMorning Consult: Best policy areas are immigration, national security\n\nA Morning Consult poll conducted Nov. 21-23 found 45% of responders approved of Trump's job performance, compared to 52% who disapprove. The poll surveyed 2,200 registered U.S. voters with a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\nOn handling specific issues, Trump received the worst disapproval on health care and the economy, according to Morning Consult. The best issues for Trump, according to the poll, on national security and immigration.\n\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

Speaking on a recent episode of the Inside Trump's Head podcast, the reporter cited a source “quite up close to what is going on” in the administration, who summed up the internal reaction to the Mamdani visit as “What the f---?” Trump's behavior was so out of left field that it gave some in the White House concerns about the president's mental state. \n\n“Nobody expected that. This was not the script,\" Wolff said of the source's reaction. \"It was completely out of the blue... and concerning. This wasn’t just losing the plot. This was like a different guy. The look in his eyes was crazy.”\n\nPrior to the meeting, Trump's comments about Mamdani had been overwhelmingly negative, calling him a \"communist lunatic,\" musing that the administration might have him arrested and, at one point, suggesting that he might be in the country \"illegally\" despite being a naturalized citizen.\n\n“The only explanation was that the guy forgot who he is—so weird,” Wolff's source added. “It gives you a 25th Amendment shiver.”\n\nThe 25th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, while largely concerned with more standard succession issues surrounding the presidency, also contains key provisions allowing for the removal of the president's powers and responsibilities should the vice president and a majority of the cabinet agree that they are not currently mentally or physically able to carry them out. The vice president would become the acting president for as long as it takes for the president to regain their ability, or until they leave office. Since being ratified in 1967, it has largely been invoked in instances where the president is incapacitated during medical procedures.",

        "text": "Hot Air's David Strom asks, \"Just How Bad Will Mamdani Be?\" The answer is pretty darn bad, and that may be an understatement.\n\nFor any executive political office, listening to what a politician says about what he's going to do is only part of the equation. The actual test of the way someone will govern in an executive capacity is in who they choose to advise them. Choosing the advisors reveals the inner workings of an executive's mind, and Mamdani has told us a lot about that little voice in his head by looking at the people he's chosen to sit on his advisory committees.\n\nOn Monday, the socialist mayor-elect released a list of his advisors for his \"community safety committee.\" It should actually be called the \"dismantle the NYPD committee.\" Some of the characters he named to advise him are straight out of a Karl Marx comic book. \n\nTake Professor Alex Vitale, Professor of Sociology and Coordinator of the Policing and Social Justice Project at Brooklyn College and the CUNY Graduate Center. Is this guy punking us, or is he serious?\n\n🚨 “Kill the Cop in Our Head”: Mamdani Transition Pick Rejects Reform, Calls Policing “Violence Work,” and Advocates for \"Pod Mapping\"Zohran Mamdani just appointed Professor Alex Vitale to his community safety transition team.Vitale says it plainly, “Policing is about… pic.twitter.com/jvwgh3CUt6— Stu Smith (@thestustustudio) November 25, 2025\n\n“Policing is about violence work, and I want to get the violence out of it, whatever we call it.” “It also doesn’t mean everything has to be under the control of the state… we can do co-counseling and we can do pod mapping. We can do that person-to-person organizing of our daily lives and our living spaces and our working spaces.”\n\nGolly gosh darn it, I can see paradise by the dashboard light. This guy should be kept more than 500 yards from any police station in the city.\n\nAnother entrant in the \"Craziest Marxist Appointed by Mamdani\" sweepstakes is Tamika Mallory. Mallory was a moving force behind the 2017 Women's March opposing Donald Trump's inauguration. Actually, the Women's March was nothing more than a radical-left bitch session about life in general. Every leftist bugaboo known to man and god was protested, shouted against, advocated against, and hysterically screamed about by several million women and others who secretly wanted to be girls.\n\nMallory was recruited to help implement Zohran Mamdani's signature campaign promise: \"reform\" the police. She's advising the mayor-elect on the best way to organize what may be called a new \"Department of Community Safety.\" Or it may be called a \"criminal's best friend.\"\n\nExclusively for our VIPs: America's Golden Age Will End Unless We Can Control Entitlement Spending\n\nMallory has a \"history,\" as her apologists might say. She was buddy-buddy with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and has been quoted as saying some very antisemitic things about Jews.\n\nIn 2018, however, Ms. Mallory came under scrutiny after Tablet magazine reported that she and another march leader, Carmen Perez, had suggested during an early planning meeting in 2016 that Jews “bore a special collective responsibility as exploiters of black and brown people” and repeated the false claim that Jews led the American slave trade.Such debunked allegations feature prominently in “The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews,” a book by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan that historian Henry Louis Gates Jr. described in 1992 as “the bible of the new anti-Semitism.” The Anti-Defamation League has identified Mr. Farrakhan as “one of the most prominent antisemites in America.”Ms. Mallory has denied the Tablet account, though she has repeatedly expressed public support for Mr. Farrakhan. In 2017, she posted a photo with Mr. Farrakhan on Instagram, wishing him happy birthday and calling him “the GOAT.” The following year she attended and promoted a Farrakhan event where he accused “Satanic Jews” of having a “grip on the media” and declared that “the powerful Jews are my enemy.”\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League (ADL) called Mallory “simply the wrong choice for a committee on community safety.”\n\nAn ADL spokesman told the Sun, “Given the fact that New York’s Jewish community is facing antisemitism and security threats at unprecedented levels, the mayor-elect needs to appoint someone who will unite, rather than divide, communities.\"\n\nWhen announcing the committees, Mamdani stated that a \"love for hard work, a deep belief in the promise of New York City, and a commitment to the affordability agenda that New Yorkers are demanding unite the more than 400 experts we have appointed to our Transition team.\"\n\nIf Vitale and Mallory are any indication of what Mamdani's transition team believes, New York City is in a lot worse trouble than they might suspect.\n\nIt's the holiday season, which means PJ Media VIP's Black Friday sale is back!\n\nNow through Monday evening, 11:59 PM ET, receive 60% OFF an annual VIP, VIP Gold, or VIP Platinum membership with promo code FIGHT.\n\nAlready have a VIP membership?

Mamdani met with the president at the White House on Friday, where President Donald Trump called Mamdani a \"rational person.\" Trump said after the meeting that they both wanted New York City to do well, and the meeting's affable tone drew considerable attention, since both men had traded sharp barbs in recent months. \"From my point of view, flattery is not the way,\" Wu said, according to the Boston Globe. \"I think Boston residents want to stand strong on our values and to get things done and to keep moving forward, and that’s what we’re going to continue to do.\" DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST CALLS MAMDANI'S TRUMP MEETING 'WEAK' AFTER TOUGH CAMPAIGN TALK A Mamdani spokeswoman who was asked about Wu's comments referred to Mamdani's earlier comments about the meeting, where he said he still believed Trump was a threat to democracy, but it was his job as the next mayor to work with \"everyone and anyone\" to improve people's lives, according to the Times. Wu has been outspoken in her criticism of the administration's immigration policy and has defended her city's sanctuary status. \"If it came with a promise to stop snatching residents illegally off the streets, stop prosecuting his political enemies, stop cutting life-saving research and funding?\" she told reporters Monday, according to the Globe. \"Sure, I would be open to a conversation at that point.\" MAMDANI ECONOMIC ADVISOR IS REPARATIONS ACTIVIST WHO SAYS 'DEVALUATION OF BLACK LIVES' INGRAINED IN US SYSTEM Wu accused the Trump administration of being a party that \"doesn’t follow the law\" during a press conference in August. \"At a time when this federal administration is already causing so much fear and harm in our communities, these threats are serious and consequential,\" she said. \"Stop attacking our cities to hide your administration's failures. Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law… You are wrong on the law, and you are wrong on safety.\" Mamdani said after his meeting in the Oval Office that he still believed the president was a fascist. \"Everything that I've said in the past, I continue to believe,\" Mamdani told NBC's Kristen Welker on Sunday.

        "text": "Things appear to be tightening up in a congressional special election between GOP nominee Matt Van Epps and Democrat Aftyn Behn, known as the AOC of Tennessee, in a congressional district that overwhelmingly voted for President Donald Trump. What’s odd is not so much that the race is in question, special elections are always odd and unpredictable birds, but rather, that Behn is a far-left socialist in a part of the country where conventional wisdom says a socialist should have no chance. So why is this happening, and is it a warning sign for Republicans who believe they can sweep the midterms by running against socialism and making New York City Mayor-elect Zohran MamdaniMamdani the face of the Democrats? Behn is the poster child for the loony left. She supports defunding the police to this very day and she has advocated that American women should refuse to have children unless they get demands met by the government. Not only that, an old interview has surfaced in which she said she hates Nashville, the largest city in her district. DNC CHAIR DOWNPLAYS SOCIALIST–MODERATE RIFT AS MAMDANI’S RISE HAS SOME DEMS RATTLED On Tuesday afternoon, I heard Clay Travis, who lives in the district, on his radio show abjectly apoplectic about the support that Behn is receiving. But is it really so strange? I’ve spent much of the past two years traveling across America. One of the rarest types of people I ever meet on the road are moderate, what we used to call, Blue Dog Democrats. The ones I do occasionally meet tend to be over 60. The Democrats I generally encounter aren’t scared of socialism, they tend to like aspects of it, as is borne out in a recent Gallup poll. It found that 66% of Democrats have a positive view of socialism, a number that will only grow as the older, more conservative cohort ages out. DAVID MARCUS: ZANY ZOHRAN ENDORSEMENT IS EXISTENTIAL CHOICE FOR HAKEEM JEFFRIES There are a lot of white 20- and 30-something humanities graduates out there who think they're part of the intellectual upper class, but have $200,000 in student loan debt and can't even dream of buying a home. They're not wrong to think the system is rigged against them, they're just wrong to think socialism can save them. There is also an intense, and by and large successful, effort by Democrats to woo women voters, specifically with policies that appear empathetic, such as no-cash bail, in which the sweet and tender hooligan is coddled, even if it means they go on to commit more crimes. Another argument that falls flat, especially with young Democrats, is \"where has socialism ever worked?\" I recently asked that very question of two guys in Texas, the first said, \"Sweden,\" then the other said, \"Denmark, Finland….\" I hear that a lot, when younger Americans summon a vision of socialism it is not breadlines in Cuba or the former Soviet Union, but, rather, free healthcare and generous vacation benefits in Scandinavia. Finally, the constant polarization of our congressional districts has made red ones more red and blue ones more blue, creating the most target rich environment that socialists have ever had in America. What Republicans need to understand right now is that socialism, as a concept, is not as disqualifying as it once was, or as they still believe it is. If this realization is not made, it's going to be a tough midterm for the GOP. YOUNG PROGRESSIVES LOOK TO ZOHRAN MAMDANI, AOC AS FUTURE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY – UNDER ONE CONDITION This moment feels very much like 2016, when Democrats were licking their chops because Republican voters had chosen the supposedly unelectable Donald Trump as their nominee. We all know how that one turned out. What is essential over the next year is that Republicans put forth ideas that can steal back the affordability issue, which Democrats have seized on, fairly or not, and as the fruits of the Big Beautiful Law spring to life, making sure that advantages such as no tax on overtime or tips are stressed. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Behn does not have to win next week’s special election to amp up the socialist wing of the Democratic Party. Even if she stays within single digits, the far left will use it as a cudgel to insist that socialism can thrive in flyover country. And they might not be wrong. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP The political battle of the next decade in America looks poised to be between socialists on the left and whatever form of Trumpian populism emerges in the president’s wake, including some policies, like the government taking stakes in private businesses that traditional Republicans view as, well, socialist. The most important thing to recognize now is that it is no longer a shock or anomaly when Democrats elect socialists. These days, it's honestly more shocking when they don’t, and no longer just in New York and San Francisco. Don’t expect that to change any time soon. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAVID MARCUS",

        "text": "Socialist Seattle mayor-elect Katie Wilson is prepared to meet with President Donald Trump, should he decide to invite her to the White House. \"I’ll meet with anyone,\" she said, per a Seattle Times report from Tuesday. \"I mean, he’s the president of the United States.\" Wilson, who defeated Democratic Mayor Bruce Harrell in a tight race earlier this month, espouses views similar to New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's, including heftier taxes on the wealthy, government-backed grocery stores and an interest in universal child care. While Mamdani's race received far more national attention, Wilson's ascension in Washington's largest city has significant implications. Mamdani perhaps laid the groundwork for a Trump-Wilson meeting when he met with the president at the White House last week to discuss affordability, public safety and other issues concerning New Yorkers. MAMDANI-STYLE CANDIDATE LIVING OFF PARENTS' MONEY COULD OUSTER INCUMBENT DEM MAYOR Given Mamdani and Trump had traded sharp rhetoric toward each other like \"fascist\" and \"communist,\" their cordial meeting drew considerable attention and also scrutiny from their respective ideological allies. Wilson, however, pushed back against the idea that such meetings constitute \"selling out.\" Rather, she says, they will be important to her success as Seattle's next mayor. SEATTLE'S SOCIALIST MAYOR MAY BE 'LESS CONSTRAINED' THAN MAMDANI, WASHINGTON POST WARNS \"I think that a lot of people on the progressive left do have a sophisticated understanding of what it’s going to take to deliver on a bold progressive agenda, and that it’s not just about only talking to your friends and using the mayor’s office as a soapbox,\" she said, according to The Seattle Times. The outlet noted that Wilson has remained relatively quiet in some regards, however, pointing to her \"necessary meetings\" with people like Gov. Bob Ferguson, D-Wash., and her tendency to turn down national media requests. At the same time, she did not respond when Trump formerly labeled her a \"communist.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Wilson pledged during her campaign to \"Trump-proof\" Seattle and represents a resurgence of socialism, as she and Mamdani — along with national democratic socialist figures like Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. — try to push Democrats leftward. Both Wilson and Mamdani put affordability at the forefront of their campaigns, an issue that drove people to the polls in the 2024 presidential election as well. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment. Fox News' Andrew Mark Miller and Alec Schemmel contributed to this report.",

        "text": "This article is part of TPM Cafe, TPM’s home for opinion and news analysis.\n\nFor a lot of young Americans, every major life decision that signifies adulthood starts with the same question: Can I afford it? \n\nCan I afford to move for that “dream job”? Can I afford to get married, have a kid, or take care of one? Can I afford to buy a home, or even just stay in the one I rent? \n\nFor previous generations, those questions had simpler answers.\n\nOlder generations who bought entire homes for the same price as a down payment today often don’t fully grasp what it means to face $2,500 rent, $2,000-a-month childcare, and six-figure student debt — even with a so-called “good job.” \n\nThe divide today isn’t just about money. It’s about agency. The ability to make choices about your own life and to dream about your future was something every generation before us was told was their birthright. \n\nFor millions of young Americans today, that sense of freedom feels out of reach.\n\nThe generational divide of our moment isn’t about partisanship or social issues. It’s about affordability — and how differently each generation experiences what it takes to build a good life.\n\nThat gap shows up in politics, too. You can hear it in how candidates talk about the economy. For the so-called old guard, affordability is something they discuss in abstract terms: inflation, wages, interest rates, the stock market — numbers on a spreadsheet. \n\nFor younger candidates, it’s personal. They don’t have to imagine what it’s like to split rent five ways or watch childcare swallow half a paycheck. They know it — they’re living it.\n\nThey’ve made the same trade-offs: skipping doctors’ appointments because of deductibles, picking up Uber and DoorDash shifts to make ends meet, and delaying milestones their parents or grandparents managed to reach a decade earlier. \n\nThat perspective changes everything.\n\nWhen candidates like Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in New York talk about freezing rent or expanding universal childcare, they’re not being idealistic. They’re naming what’s necessary for people to live full, dignified lives. That’s why young voters flock to leaders like him — because their prescriptions aren’t just policies. They offer permission to hope again. They make the promise — or even concept — of a better future seem attainable.\n\nFor generations that were forced to grow up through a recession, a housing crisis, and a pandemic, that hope isn’t something abstract. It’s a lifeline. \n\nFor too long, young people have been told to tighten their belts, hustle harder, and stop complaining. We’ve been told that if we just worked a little more or spent a little less, we could make it work — as if our economy is a test of character and resilience instead of a system that’s fundamentally broken.\n\nBut this new generation of leaders sees through that lie. They’re not running for office simply to nibble around the edges of the status quo; they’re running to reclaim agency over their own futures. They understand that the promise of America — that hard work and education can buy you stability and choice — has eroded for millions of people. They’re determined to not just make a new promise but to actually keep it this time.\n\nAnd they are living the same realities as the people they hope to represent. Many of them are renters, caregivers, first-generation college graduates, or young people with mountains of student debt (or all of the above), who are campaigning while working second jobs. That authenticity isn’t a branding exercise — it’s simply the truth, and it’s what young voters trust. \n\nThat’s why young people are turning out to vote for them, volunteering for them, and even running themselves at record numbers. More than 75,000 people have reached out to Run for Something since the November 2024 election, and over 5,000 in the week after Zohran Mamdani’s big win. That’s because these candidates offer a vision of a life that feels livable for the first time.\n\nThey’re not just telling young people that a better future is possible — they’re showing what it looks like, through policy and through example.\n\nAnd that’s the thing that gives me hope.\n\nThe affordability crisis may have taken away a lot of our choices, but it hasn’t taken away our will to fight for them. Every young leader stepping up right now — in city councils, state legislatures and, yes, mayors’ offices — is proving that this generation isn’t apathetic. We just want a fair shot at the same stability our parents had.\n\nMaybe that’s what older generations don’t quite see yet: young people aren’t asking for anything radical. We’re just asking for the space to build our lives — and maybe even dream a little, too",

        "text": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent sang praises of New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani (D) on Tuesday following the surprisingly cordial meeting with President Trump on Friday at the White House.\n\nAppearing on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Bessent made positive remarks about Mamdani after co-host Andrew Ross Sorkin said he was curious to hear the treasury secretary’s reaction to the meeting that took place after Trump and Mamdani traded public barbs at each other for months. \n\nBessent, who said he attended the meeting between the democratic socialist and Trump, told Sorkin, “You’ve got to have some admiration for a candidate who ran a campaign the way he did... It was a great, great campaign.”\n\nDeclaring that Mamdani is “clearly the leader of the Democratic Party now,” Bessent continued, “and I think it speaks to how open-minded the president is that he invited him into the Oval [Office].” \n\nBessent, a Republican, argued that Trump “wants the best for New Yorkers” before slyly sliding in a jab against Mamdani, calling him “a young man with a lot of old ideas that have never worked.”\n\n“It’s easy to run a campaign, but the practical everyday of keeping people safe, picking up the trash, making the subways run on time — we’ll see,” Bessent added. \n\nOn Friday, Mamdani and Trump appeared jovial at the highly anticipated meeting, smiling and laughing together as they vowed to work together to address New York City’s affordability and housing crisis. \n\nAt one point, Mamdani was asked during the meeting if he still thinks Trump is a “fascist.” Before he could respond, the president interjected, telling him, “That’s OK, you can just say ‘yes’. It’s easier than explaining it, I don’t mind.”\n\n“OK, yes,” the mayor-elect responded with a grin as Trump smiled back and patted him on his arm.\n\nOver the weekend, Mamdani was asked yet again whether he thinks Trump is a fascist during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\nMamdani didn’t back down. \n\n“That’s something that I’ve said in the past. I say it today,” he told the outlet. “And I think what I appreciated about the conversation that I had with the president was that we were not shy about the places of disagreement, about the politics that has brought us to this moment.’ \n\nMamdani added, “And we also wanted to focus on what it could look like to deliver on a shared analysis of an affordability crisis for New Yorkers.”\n\nWatch Bessent’s appearance on CNBC below.",

        "text": "The New Yorker's Jay Caspian Kang says that life after President Donald Trump may not be what people expect, as an \"abrupt realignment\" in politics may emerge from, of all places, the scandal surrounding deceased convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nKang describes the situation surrounding the scandal as \"Planet Epstein.\"\n\n\"That planet is an information ecosystem where all major global events are connected to the sex-trafficking conspiracy that supposedly rules the world,\" Kang explains, adding that \"in the past few months, I have been trying to gauge how much of the American public is now convinced that a cabal of pedophiles runs the world.\"\n\nWhile polls have shown that most Americans do believe the government is hiding information about Epstein and his cohorts, Kang notes that \"there is a difference between suspecting a coverup and going full Pizzagate-conspiracy mode, drawing connections among [former U.S. Treasury Secretary and Harvard University president Larry] Summers, Epstein, Trump, Bill Clinton, [Israeli national intelligence agency] Mossad, and the sudden rise of the A.I. industry, which now seems to be propping up a large part of the world economy — and then concluding that some shadowy group of oligarchs rules us all.\"\n\nFollowing the votes to release the Epstein files and the defection of former Trump acolyte Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) from the House, Kang argues \"we are in the middle of a quietly revolutionary moment in this country, which began with the pandemic and the protests stemming from the murder of George Floyd by a police officer.\"\n\n\"The subsequent unrest has taken on a variety of forms, including a continued and drastic decline in trust of the traditional news media and attacks on universities from both the left and the right,\" he adds. \n\nThat unrest, he writes, \"was also channeled into Trump’s 2024 campaign, which was less about any one issue than it was about a renewed and utterly hollow promise to drain the swamp all over again.\"\n\nThe Epstein scandal has provided \"a single theory of the world\" that didn't rely on partisan leanings to feed that \"insurrectionary energy,\" Kang writes.\n\n\"Epstein has provided that. Lest we forget, Epstein died more than six years ago now, and although the story certainly had not been forgotten by the public, it had at least been moved to a low-heat back burner when Greene; Thomas Massie, a U.S. representative from Kentucky; and a handful of other politicians began to talk about the Epstein files again,\" he says.\n\nKang says that a little over a month ago, he wrote that \"on Planet Epstein, everything that happens — the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the war in Gaza, the suppression of speech by the Trump Administration — serves as proof that the country is run by blackmail, pedophilia and fealty to Israel.\"\n\n\"I do not think very many Americans buy into every part of that story, and I imagine that a great number would be rightfully appalled by the implicit and explicit antisemitism in this view of the world,\" he added.\n\nNow, Kang says, \"In hindsight, I fear that I might have undersold the number of Americans who do believe all those things.\"\n\nRising from the \"Epstein mess,\" Kang writes, is Greene, whose \"sudden resignation only adds another chapter to the conspiracy narrative on Planet Epstein.\"\n\n\"America loves righteous defectors, and her turn away from Trump — along with her newly measured tone when speaking in big-time media interviews or, last week, in front of the Capitol, flanked with Epstein survivors — turned someone who was an embarrassment into one of the more formidable members of the House of Representatives,\" Kang notes.\n\nAnd while Kang doubts that \"Greene, freed from Congress, and in spite of her past nuttiness and humiliations,\" will \"become the magnet who pulls together the populist right and the populist,\" he does expect her to run for president with \"someone from the insurrectionary left as her running mate.\"\n\n\"Such a campaign would certainly feature a lot of talk about Epstein and Israel, and would likely call for a new vision of the country that did away with what Greene called traitors who serve “foreign countries and themselves,\" Kang muses.\n\nAs for how such a ticket would fare against more mainstream politicians on either side, Kang says not very well, probably, because \"political inertia and the two-party system are still powerful forces, despite the Epstein revolution that’s taking place on every smartphone in the country.\"\n\nWhatever does ensue, Kang writes, he is certain that \"political life after Trump will be defined by odd ideological pairings that do not follow the political lines of the past twenty years. An abrupt realignment now feels more probable than endless polarization.\"\n\n\"Some of the surprises that result from this realignment, such as [NYC mayor elect Zohran] Mamdani’s unlikely victory, will surely cause both hope and fear, as people grapple with the unexpected. But I do not think that we can fully predict the alliances to come, nor the new order they will bring,\" he concludes.",

        "text": "Trump designates Muslim Brotherhood as an FTO: Certain chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood will be designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists per an executive order signed by President Trump on Monday. The Muslim Brotherhood was founded in 1928 in Egypt as a Sunni Islamic organization aiming to gain political power. It exists today as a collection of loosely affiliated Islamic chapters, some directly associated with other Islamic terrorist organizations such as Hamas. Designating the Muslim Brotherhood as an FTO allows the U.S. to go after the organization’s U.S.-based finances, conduct military intel, and prosecute those who offer “material support” to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nRubio rolls back DEI, State employees cheer: Despite the negative reporting surrounding Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s efforts to expunge woke DEI ideology from the State Department, it turns out that even the department’s leftist employees appreciate a commitment to meritocracy over race-based favoritism. Since Rubio has thrown out the Biden-era DEIA category for evaluating overall work proficiency and offered restitution to some 295 employees who were marked down for failing to show they would “seek diversity in staff,” and thereby denied promotion, a number of employees who self-identify as “leftist” have praised Rubio. As one employee wrote, “I am very happy for everyone who is getting promoted after throwing out the ludicrous DEIA score. It is well deserved.”\n\nMeta and sex-trafficking minors: “You could incur 16 violations for prostitution and sexual solicitation, and upon the 17th violation, your account would be suspended,” testified Instagram’s former head of safety and well-being, Vaishnavi Jayakumar, in a recently unsealed court filing. The plaintiffs in the case against Meta allege that the company was well aware that its products were being used by adult strangers to contact minors, yet downplayed the issue and refused to take corrective action. The problem has been made public before; while testifying before Congress last year, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced the audience and apologized to the victims of child exploitation on his platform after being berated by Senator Josh Hawley. The current lawsuit alleges that Meta “pursued a strategy of growth at all costs,” ignoring the issue and possibly lying to Congress about its knowledge of it.\n\n2028 Dem primary and ranked-choice voting: A number of Democrats are promoting the dubious ranked-choice voting scheme following its success in making Zohran Mamdani the Democrat candidate in the New York City mayoral race. Some Democrats are advocating for adopting ranked-choice voting for the 2028 presidential primaries. They see it as a popular way to get out the vote, claiming it helps prevent the perception that people’s votes are “wasted.” Not everyone is sold, however, as a number of states and municipalities that have experimented with ranked-choice have since reverted to the fairer single-vote method. For the DNC to adopt ranked-choice voting, it would require a majority of the 450-member body to approve new rules and bylaws. Furthermore, individual state parties would need to approve the change, and on top of that, a number of state governments would have to amend their election laws.",

        "text": "Unveiling in Illinois we see the signature of modern political gaslighting and moral posturing without moral clarity. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson both engage in performative indignation; they feign outrage, sling accusations and vilify opponents, anything to avoid offering solutions, being accountable for results or admitting the truth.\n\nPritzker rarely misses a chance to compare President Donald Trump, his administration, and even his supporters to Hitler’s Nazis. He does so while invoking his role as a major financial backer of the Illinois Holocaust Museum, as though his philanthropy grants him moral license to define who the “real Nazis” are.\n\nBut Pritzker has remained nearly silent when antisemitism originates from his own party’s far-left flank – where hatred of Jews now masquerades as “resistance” and “liberation.” When demonstrations erupted on college campuses and city streets rejecting Israel’s right to exist or defend itself, Pritzker chose to preserve his political standing rather than call out antisemitism. Because condemnation risked alienating the activist base he needs for his future political ambitions, Pritzker turned a blind eye to preserve his standing. (RELATED: JB Pritzker Said Cashless Bail Would Keep Cities Safe — Then A Woman Was Burned Alive)\n\nWhen antisemitic rhetoric and behavior emerged from Chicago’s municipal leadership in October 2023, Pritzker again offered little more than disapproval, focusing attention elsewhere. Meanwhile, members of the Chicago Teachers Union organized rallies supporting a Gaza “cease-fire,” antisemitic social media posts surfaced among city leaders, including the CPS Board of Education’s president, and even Johnson called Israel’s military response “genocidal,” equating the Palestinian cause with movements for Black liberation.\n\nEven as New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani claimed headlines, Pritzker has been silent on Mamdani’s focused targeting of Israel, calls to boycott and refusal to criticize Hamas for their Oct. 7 attack.\n\nYet while shielding the extremes within his own coalition, Pritzker has intensified his attacks on Trump, repeatedly likening his policies to those found in Nazi Germany. The truth is it’s about politics, not what’s good or right; dehumanization is a tool to be used for political capital.\n\nUnfortunately, Pritzker is not alone in this hypocrisy – not even in Illinois.\n\nJohnson has learned the script as well.\n\nHis words disguise that his own actions harm the very populations he claims to champion.\n\nWhile directing hundreds of millions of dollars toward migrant relief – over $200 million — Johnson cut police resources from Black neighborhoods and CPS schools that wanted and relied on them. His budgets brought police 2,000 below full staff, while violent crimes in Chicago soared to over 28,000 instances in 2024. He sided with the CTU in blocking public school choice and charter school expansion, trapping low-income children in failing neighborhood schools. Johnson’s investments provided $324 million in subsidies to politically connected developers in exchange for only 505 affordable housing units. He raised the subminimum wage for tipped workers and doubled family leave requirements for private businesses – moves that disproportionately burden small and minority-owned businesses.\n\nAll the while, he claims Trump, his supporters, and even his critics in Chicago want to “return to the Jim Crow South.” And his warning to Mamdani was to be aware of “relentless opposition,” as if failing policies weren’t the problem.\n\nThese Illinois leaders preach “equity” while presiding over one of the nation’s most inequitable states: Illinois ranks among the highest in taxes yet among the worst in racial and economic equity. It is moral cowardice masquerading as caution.\n\nTheir antics work in one clear way: it’s increased their political visibility. Recent polling shows Johnson showed an uptick in favorability in October, after a month of visible and televised attacks on Trump for his focus on Chicago. Johnson’s 30% approval – low compared to most other major politicians – is an increase from a record-low 7% earlier this year. At the same time, Pritzker has been making the rounds on the national stage, becoming viral on social media and going as far as interviewing with Fox News’ Bret Baier. It was only in August that Illinoisans were split 50-50 on their approval of Pritzker.\n\nThe more these leaders provoke presidential backlash, and name drop Trump, the more they can posture before cameras as martyrs of “the resistance.” Meanwhile, Chicago and Illinois taxpayers, commuters and families absorb the cost and struggle without help.\n\nWhen elected officials equate their opponents with Nazis, their police with the Gestapo, or opposition sympathizers with the old Confederacy, they destroy the shared moral vocabulary that keeps a democracy intact. Their words invite confrontation. Their rhetoric radicalizes the margins. And the activists who respond are not seeking reform; they’re engineering chaos.\n\nThis is not leadership. It is political theater performed at the expense of public trust and civic stability. While Pritzker and Johnson polish their resistance credentials, ordinary residents face rising taxes, violence, and asymmetrical inequality.\n\nIllinois deserves serious solutions and accountability, not showmanship. Real leaders don’t gaslight their constituents, they serve them.\n\nPaul Vallas is a policy advisor to the Illinois Policy Institute and was the first CEO of Chicago Public Schools.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

        "text": "New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani disclosed what happened during his White House meeting with President Donald Trump last week.\n\nThe democratic socialist, when asked about the “weirdest” thing he spotted during the visit in an appearance on “The Adam Friedland Show,” said he was sitting down and waiting for his meeting with the president when he saw “all these different coffee table books” in front of him.\n\n“One of them is ‘UFC at the White House,’” said Mamdani, adding that he had “no idea” about the mixed martial arts event set to take place on the South Lawn in June. “I was just flipping through that.”\n\nMamdani, when asked by Friedland if he saw photos of guys fighting each other in the book, noted that it was just a visualization of what the UFC’s octagon-shaped cage arena would look like on the South Lawn.\n\nThe event — which Trump first teased in July as part of America’s 250th anniversary celebration — is expected to include fighter weigh-ins at the Lincoln Memorial and is scheduled to coincide with the president’s 80th birthday on June 14, 2026.\n\nUFC President and CEO Dana White — in an interview with Fox News in September — revealed that the seating capacity for the event would be around 5,000, citing security concerns. This marks a notable drop from Trump’s initial estimate of up to 25,000 spectators.\n\nWhite, who has endorsed Trump since his 2016 campaign, has also claimed that a park near the White House could host 85,000 people to watch the event on TV screens. He told Sports Business Journal in October that his company would pay $700,000 to replace the White House lawn after the event.\n\nFriedland asked Mamdani whether he was planning to attend the event.\n\n“No,” replied Mamdani with a chuckle.",

        "text": "New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's smile carried him a long way toward being elected. And he used his affability again on Friday, turning the meeting he had requested with President Donald Trump into an Oval Office lovefest.\n\nNow it's time for the mayor-elect to employ the power of smiling to make day-to-day life better for New Yorkers when they are compelled to interact with city employees. Mamdani needs to call on the 300,000 city employees to show warmth, respect, and courtesy to the public. The spirit of a smile.\n\nWalk into a city agency or court building seeking help, and you're likely to get barked at and herded like a dumb animal. Ask a Metropolitan Transportation Authority employee why the train isn't coming, and you're apt to hear, \"Can't you read the sign?\" followed by a muttered \"dumb f--k.\" It's a bruising experience.\n\nI went to family court at 111 Centre Street last Thursday to be appointed as a guardian for a 95-year-old woman, bed-bound in a nursing home. Arriving at the appointed time of 9:30 a.m., I found 80 people in a line snaking around the outside of the building, waiting to enter and go through the one available metal scanner.\n\nI inched ahead in the line until I was third from the entrance. A burly man in a guard uniform suddenly came through the door, held his arm horizontally in front of me, and yelled an order for all of us to turn around and proceed to the entrance at the back of the building. Everyone who had made it to the front of the line would now be at the back of the line. I calmly said \"no,\" and that I had waited once and would like to enter, and I started to walk around him to the door. He held his arm out to stop me and barked his order again, adding, \"Do you think you're someone special?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, adding below my breath, \"We are human beings.\" I pushed my way around him and into the building, taking the two women behind me in as well.\n\nThe fact is, everyone in that line deserved dignified treatment -- but that's not the treatment being meted out by employees at 111 Centre Street.\n\nWhen I got upstairs, I took a seat outside Judge Ilana Marcus's courtroom. Noon arrived, and I still hadn't been called. I pulled open the courtroom door a crack to see if the elderly patient's case was still being discussed.\n\nAt that point, a court guard pushed through the door, screamed at me for opening the door, and refused to answer any questions about whether I was even in the right hallway. When I tried to speak, she shut me down.\n\nThat's how people too often are treated in city agencies and courtrooms. And it's reflected in the low ratings New Yorkers give city services. Only 27% rate them overall good or excellent, reports the Citizens Budget Commission, though New Yorkers give high ratings to fire protection and garbage collection.\n\nBut if you want to see nastiness, visit the McCarren public pool in Brooklyn. As one swimmer commented, \"The attendants in the ladies' room are definitely from a prison movie.\"\n\nThe quality of public services and their delivery were barely mentioned in the many months of mayoral campaigning, with the candidates battling instead over Trump and the fate of Gaza.\n\nTo the extent Mamdani discussed quality of life in the city, he reduced it to one word: \"dignity.\" He said, \"A life of dignity should not be reserved for the fortunate few.\"\n\nBut he talked about only one way of restoring dignity: the government's role in helping working people afford child care or a decent place to live.\n\n\"No New Yorker should ever be priced out of anything they need to survive. ... It is government's job to deliver that dignity.\"\n\nChild care and groceries cost money, but on day one, Mamdani can go a long way toward helping New Yorkers feel dignified in this hardscrabble city by asking them to be treated with civility.\n\nMamdani should announce a dignity campaign, calling on public employees to treat all of us with civility instead of herding us like animals and barking instructions at us.\n\nHe should take a page out of the 99th mayor's playbook. Former Mayor Fiorello La Guardia approached a group of city officials incognito and waited while they ignored him. When one of them finally said something, La Guardia shouted back, \"Take off your hat when you speak to a citizen,\" as he knocked the hat off the worker's head.\n\nToday, that would be going too far. Working rules forbid it. But in the 1990s, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani also called for more civility from public employees.\n\nThe New York City Police Department had its \"Courtesy, Professionalism, Respect\" motto. That should be the code of conduct citywide.\n\nTarget is mandating that its in-store workers smile and make eye contact with shoppers. That's good business. Customers have options.\n\nNew Yorkers sometimes find themselves with no option but to walk into a courtroom or into a city agency to apply for a permit. But they should get the same courteous treatment as customers with options.\n\nLaunching a civility campaign and putting some energy behind it could help dispel the skepticism and dread many New Yorkers feel about the incoming Mamdani.\n\nPut that grin to work, Mr. Mayor.\n\nBetsy McCaughey is a former Lt.

        "text": "Late-night hosts discussed Donald Trump’s strangely friendly meeting with New York’s mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.\n\nSeth Meyers\n\nSeth Meyers devoted his Monday Closer Look segment to the bizarrely friendly White House meeting between Donald Trump and New York’s mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, where the president seemed downright pleased to be meeting the Democratic socialist that his administration has long demonized.\n\n“He looks like a five-year-old meeting Mickey Mouse,” said an amused Meyers. Though Trump had previously called Mamdani a “communist” and a “total nutjob” the president seemed charmed by the 34-year-old mayor.\n\n“I’ve never seen Trump this smitten before,” the Late Night host said. “This is a reminder: he doesn’t work with a single cool person! He is surrounded by so many charmless goons that the first time he got to hang out with someone that had a little charisma, he swooned like he was on a date with the varsity quarterback.\n\n“You’d have stars in your eyes too if you spent every day of your life with joyless gargoyles like Stephen Miller and JD Vance, and then you met a 34-year-old social media star who rapped in a halal cart and once appeared in an actual Disney movie,” he added.\n\nMeyers then trained on arguably the most surprising moment of the Oval Office meeting: when Trump interjected as Mamdani was asked about previously calling the president a fascist. “That’s OK, you can just say, ‘Yes.’ OK? It’s easier – it’s easier than explaining it. I don’t mind,” Trump said while patting Mamdani on the arm.\n\n“That is the flirtiest I’ve ever heard anyone say, ‘You can call me a fascist,’” Meyers joked, before breaking out his Trump impression: “You can call me a fascist, you can call me – I’ll be whatever you want me to be!”\n\n“Of course, it won’t be remotely surprising if Trump changes his tune,” he concluded. “We’ve seen it happen many times before. But the one takeaway that will last is that all the Maga scare tactics evaporated. The right thought meeting Trump would be Zohran’s worst nightmare, but it turns out meeting Zohran was Trump’s dream come true.”\n\nJimmy Kimmel\n\nAnd in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel celebrated his frequent target Marjorie Taylor Greene’s resignation from Congress, after a falling-out with Trump. “Yet another Trump superfan learns that loyalty to him goes only one way,” he laughed.\n\nIn a message to her constituents, Greene said she found that Congress was beholden to the supremely wealthy and ignores the needs of ordinary Americans. “She says her party has no plan for healthcare, and that the Jeffrey Epstein files are not a hoax that the president claims they are – to which I say, welcome to reality, Marge,” said Kimmel. “We’re glad to have you here. Make yourself at home, and feel free to check out our science wing while you have a chance.\n\n“Marjorie is out and Mamdani is in,” he added, referring to Trump’s “highly unlikely Friendsgiving on Friday at the White House” with Mamdani. “Most people were expecting fireworks,” he said, “but they did not expect them to be the Katy Perry kind.”\n\n“They have the vibe of a wealthy elderly gay man at the Cheesecake Factory ordering his shy young boyfriend dessert,” Kimmel said of the chummy affair.\n\nTrump, to Kimmel’s shock, lavished Mamdani with praise, saying, among other things: “He really ran an incredible race, and I congratulated him,” “it’s an amazing thing that he did,” “I think you’re going to have hopefully a really great mayor, and the better he does, the happier I am” and “I feel very confident that he’s going to do a great job.”\n\n“What a turn of events!” Kimmel exclaimed. “It was like he was giving a wedding toast to his new son-in-law. It’s almost as if, and I know this sounds crazy – it’s almost as if Trump doesn’t have any real political convictions at all. He just says whatever, whenever.”\n\nOf Trump’s physical displays of affection for the young mayor, Kimmel added: “He touched him more in that press conference that he’s touched Melania all year.”\n\nThe unlikely alliance left heads spinning in Maga world. “They had to unplug and reboot Sean Hannity five times after this,” Kimmel chuckled. “This is how upside-down this crop of Maga-teers is: they’re mad at Trump, some of them are furious at Trump, because he was friendly with the new mayor of New York. Last week, he had a big celebratory dinner for the Saudi prince whose goons dismembered a columnist for the Washington Post? No problem. This? Too much.\n\n“Anybody who’s surprised that Trump got along with Mamdani should not be surprised,” he concluded. “Trump loves when famous people come to visit.”",

        "text": "Dial F for Finished.\n\nThe city Department of Education wants to phase out the thousands of archaic landlines at its 1,800 schools and is set to seek bids from companies to install a strictly online system.\n\n“As our schools, city, and world evolves, we are in the infancy stages of evaluating telecommunications alternatives that would significantly reduce our reliance on traditional landlines,” a DOE rep said.\n\n“This effort, which focuses on resiliency and reliability, would build a system to withstand disruptions and shorten service restorations should they occur,” the representative said.\n\nThe DOE sent out an information request to potential bidders, a precursor for an official bid for a new telecommunications system.\n\nThe public notice reviewed by The Post said the DOE is looking to “transition from aging digital PBX [Private Branch Exchange] systems to a unified, resilient, and cost-effective VOI [Voice over Internet Protocol] ecosystem … to replace NYC DOE’s legacy telephony systems across over 1,800 school and administrative sites.”\n\nDOE officials declined to specify the costs of such an overhaul or how many landlines would be replaced. But it would clearly be a massive undertaking.\n\nThe new telecommunication system must support 150,000 staffers in 1,800 schools serving 900,000 students, as well as outreach to parents, meaning multilingual features would have to be part of any plan.\n\nThe telecom overhaul would likely take place under Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s administration.\n\nThe move comes as New York schools banned use of personal cell phones during class periods, an edict approved by Gov. Kathy Hochul.",

        "text": "Democrats love violence and lawlessness. Attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers continue to increase, and we know where the blame lies.\n\nIn a Nov. 24 press release, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that compared to last year, attacks on ICE officers are up 1,153%. Between Jan. 21 and Nov. 21 last year, there were 19 assaults on ICE. During the same period this year, there were 238. Meanwhile, Democrats in government, media, and business continue to spread egregious lies about and smears against ICE.\n\nThe real-world consequences are devastating. “After months of Democrat politicians comparing ICE to Nazis, the gestapo, slave patrols, and even encouraging illegal aliens to resist arrest, our brave ICE law enforcement have been assaulted 238 times,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. She referred to just some of the weapons used:\n\nOur law enforcement officers have had Molotov cocktails and rocks thrown at them, been shot at, had cars used as weapons against them, and been physically assaulted. Sanctuary politicians need to tone the rhetoric down before a law enforcement officer is killed. They should be thanking these brave law enforcement officers who risk their lives every single day to arrest pedophiles, rapists, murderers, gang members, and terrorists from our neighborhoods.\n\nRelated: Biden Admin Pressured Airports to House Illegal Aliens\n\nICE shared a photo of an ICE officer who was seriously injured on his face when Salvadoran illegal Walter Leonel Perez Rodriguez attacked him with a metal coffee cup.\n\nICE Officer Brutally Attacked by Illegal Alien PedophileSalvadoran illegal Walter Leonel Perez Rodriguez \"struck an ICE officer in the face with a metal coffee cup, causing a laceration to the officer’s lip resulting in 13 stitches and burns to the side of his face,\" DHS says pic.twitter.com/pkF8xLkP8p— Border Hawk (@BorderHawkNews) November 6, 2025\n\nThe DHS press release also included other examples of attacks on federal law enforcement, including the Tren de Aragua gang member who attempted to murder an officer and the illegal alien who threw a Molotov cocktail at officers during the riots in Los Angeles. And, of course, there was the terrorist attack at the Dallas ICE facility, which resulted in the death of a detainee.\n\nOver the last 10 months, federal officers and agents across the DHS enterprise have faced a dangerously escalating pattern of violence, ranging from hitting, spitting, kicking and biting during arrests, to vehicle ramming, open gun fire, and the throwing of Molotov cocktails. These nationwide incidents show how ICE officers are being targeted because of the badge they wear, not just the enforcement operations they execute on behalf of the American people.\n\nMultiple Antifa members recently admitted to terrorist activities in connection with a different attack on a Texas ICE facility, which almost resulted in the death of an officer. They had the dubious honor of becoming the first Antifa members convicted of terrorism since Donald Trump so designated Antifa.\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, New York Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, and Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) are just a few of the Democrats whose outrageous lies about ICE have fueled the violence.\n\nEditor’s Note: Support and follow PJ Media’s coverage of breaking news and Democrat corruption.

This was not the script. It was completely out of the blue... and concerning,” the White House insider said, according to Wolff. \n\nThe person added, “This wasn’t just losing the plot. This was like a different guy. The look in his eyes was crazy.”\n\nWolff said White House staff had expected Trump to project a “message of dominance and submission” in his presser with Mamdani, whom the president had previously trashed as a “communist lunatic” and threatened to arrest and deport.\n\nInstead, a fawning Trump said he would “absolutely” feel “comfortable” living in Mamdani’s city, defended him against the right’s “jihadist” label, and pledged to help the new democratic socialist mayor do a “good job.” \n\nAccording to Wolff, his White House source told him, “The only explanation was that the guy forgot who he is—so weird,” confessing, “It gives you a 25th Amendment shiver.”\n\nThe 25th Amendment affords the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet the power to declare the president unfit if he is no longer able to perform his duties. \n\nQuestions about Trump’s mental and physical fitness have long fueled online debate about invoking the amendment. But in recent weeks, as cracks have appeared in the elderly president’s grip on the MAGA movement amid struggles to deliver on his campaign promises, even some MAGA loyalists have called on JD Vance, 41, to take action.\n\nWhen reached for comment, White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told the Daily Beast, “Michael Wolff is a lying sack of s--t and has been proven to be a fraud. He routinely fabricates stories originating from his sick and warped imagination, only possible because he has a severe and debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted his peanut-sized brain.”\n\nWolff said the White House had greeted Mamdani’s victory in America’s largest city earlier this month as a welcome opportunity to create a “perfect enemy” who would act as a foil to Trump.\n\n“It just fit every category that they needed until he comes to the White House and becomes the model citizen for Donald Trump’s new world,” Wolff observed. \n\n“What about the idea that somehow Trump is playing three-dimensional chess?” Coles questioned.\n\n“I’m glad you asked,” Wolff responded, explaining that the White House insider had told him, “He doesn’t play 3-D chess. He has one game, and this wasn’t it.” \n\nWolff, who Trump allowed behind the scenes of the White House for nine months during his first term, noted that the former reality TV star usually wants to project a “dominant” and “angry” persona—but not around Mamdani. \n\n“Trump is so good at playing the role, but he clearly was... out of character playing a different role,” Wolff said. “And the view of this person [in the White House] and people around Trump was that they had no explanation for what was going on here.”\n\nMamdani walked out of the White House sit-down having scored a political win. Trump on Saturday backed down from sending federal troops into the city—a significant reversal of his previous stance to “clean up the crime” and “save New York City”—saying he would do so “if they need it.”",

Kathy Hochul Tuesday over a member of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s transition team who has voiced support for infamous cop killers.\n\nBlack Nationalist Lumumba Bandele was picked to serve on the incoming mayor’s Committee on Community Organizing on Monday despite previously aligning with Black Liberation Army members convicted of killing police officers in the tristate area.\n\nStefanik, a Republican looking to run against Hochul in next year’s election, quickly blasted the decision and called on Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul to pressure Mamdani to push Bandele aside. \n\n“Kathy Hochul’s endorsed Mayor-elect, Zohran Mamdani, just picked a man who supports the killers of cops in New York and New Jersey to serve on his transition team,” she said in a statement to The Post.\n\n“Mamdani’s vision for New York is getting very clear and it’s starting to look like a nightmare. Kathy Hochul must immediately call on Mamdani to fire Lumumba Bandele from his transition team.”\n\nBandele, now of the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement, attended a rally pushing for Herman Bell’s release from prison in March 2018, according to the Workers World newspaper after Bell and two others lured two NYPD officers to a Harlem housing project and then gunned them down in 1971.\n\nBell was ultimately granted his freedom in 2018 after the parole board found he was reformed and remorseful over the sickening crime.\n\nBandele also mentioned how he met several times with Assata Shakur, who escaped from prison while serving a life sentence for killing a New Jersey cop and fled to Cuba, where she was granted political asylum.\n\nHe offered praise in a video earlier this month and talked about their longtime relationship.\n\nShakur, who died in September, shot and killed a New Jersey state trooper during a gunfight in 1973. \n\nBandele saluted Shakur and Bell on Veterans Day 2024 as among the “many soldiers that served valiantly in the people’s military to defend our communities.”\n\nMamdani’s transition campaign and Hochul’s office did not immediately reply to messages seeking comment.\n\nA message was also not immediately returned by Bandele.\n\nHe is one of more than 400 community members and stakeholders to sit on 17 transition committees before Mamdani takes office in January.",

        "text": "Short answer: who knows? \n\nLonger answer: probably not as bad as you think in the short run, and quite awful in the medium to long term, although perhaps not much worse than Bill de Blasio, who was plenty awful. \n\nFirst things first: Mamdani is almost certainly as bad or worse than you believe, so I am not making the argument that he is a socialist with a pragmatic streak who will try to turn New York City into Stockholm in the 1970s, before the Swedes wised up a bit and abandoned hard socialism for a capitalist economy with a strong social insurance system. Of course, Swedes then went all in on mass migration, which has turned it into one of the rape capitals of the world and Western Europe's bombing capital, but that is a different story. \n\nNo, Mamdani really is a communist with a pretty smile. If you doubt how awful Mamdani and his circle are, read John's piece from earlier today. If he were the leader of a revolutionary movement who captured the city by force, he would try to turn it into Cuba or Venezuela and blame all the trouble on Trump. \n\nHere's one of his transition advisors:\n\n🚨 Mamdani Transition Pick: “Police Are a Direct Interference” With “Radical Socialist Oriented Politics”… and “They Will Be Used to Stop Us”Professor Alex Vitale, now on Mamdani’s transition team, says the quiet part out loud, admitting that abolishing the police “creates… pic.twitter.com/3wFicpmxIU— Stu Smith (@thestustustudio) November 25, 2025\n\nHis policy advisors range from some bureaucrats who are willing to work with whoever is their boss to Marxists who would put you up against a wall if they could. He has a radical agenda and will, to the extent possible, try to implement it. And even if he can't check off his wish list through diktats, he can rearrange regulations to implement his policies in the longer term. \n\nZorhan Mamdani says the quiet part out loud,Under Mamdani, if there is a 'bad landlord' the city is going to take over and seize the propertypic.twitter.com/je3V5OTfbV— Defiant L’s (@DefiantLs) November 8, 2025\n\nGuess who gets to decide what defines a bad landlord? City bureaucrats, that's who. Over the longer term, one can use rules and regulations to seize property and take it over. \n\nWhat happens to landlords after Zohran Mamdani freezes rent across NYC? Well of course, they get to apply for government help too (as long as they can prove they aren't making a profit).What could go wrong? 😜 pic.twitter.com/eUj7khFr7T— MAZE (@mazemoore) October 27, 2025\n\nBut many of the policies Mamdani wants to implement will actually be quite difficult to push through, not necessarily because he or other city leaders won't have the will, but out of the sheer inertia of a city filled with millions of people, seriously smart lawyers, and other politicians who won't be inclined to cooperate. \n\n🚨 “Kill the Cop in Our Head”: Mamdani Transition Pick Rejects Reform, Calls Policing “Violence Work,” and Advocates for \"Pod Mapping\"Zohran Mamdani just appointed Professor Alex Vitale to his community safety transition team.Vitale says it plainly, “Policing is about… pic.twitter.com/jvwgh3CUt6— Stu Smith (@thestustustudio) November 25, 2025\n\nVitale says it plainly, “Policing is about violence work, and I want to get the violence out of it, whatever we call it.”“It also doesn’t mean everything has to be under the control of the state… we can do co-counseling and we can do pod mapping. We can do that person-to-person organizing of our daily lives and our living spaces and our working spaces.”Pod mapping is the idea that small circles of friends or neighbors should take over crisis response themselves — a DIY mutual-aid system where ordinary people handle emergencies instead of trained professionals, police, or even social workers.“If we’re going to get police out of our lives… it’s also about doing that hard interpersonal work in our everyday lives.”\n\nAlready, Kathy Hochul is signaling she won't sign off on tax increases or free buses, and Mamdani will face constraints that he brushed over in a campaign filled with grand promises and no plan to fulfill them. He is a salesman and doesn't understand how the government or the legal system works. \n\nAnd, amusingly enough, Mamdani has already had to kiss Trump's ring. That must have been fun for him. \n\nThere are areas where he can do great damage—for instance, the mayor has a great deal of power over the education system in New York, and obviously, the police force. I suspect he will do great damage quickly in the former, even if the consequences take a while to manifest themselves in a system that already works rather poorly. \n\nIn the latter? Mamdani will do real damage to public safety, but with 34,000 police and a lot of momentum in the system, the damage will take longer than you expect and last longer than anybody who tries to clean up his mess will want to deal with. \n\nAdam Smith famously said, \"There is a great deal of ruin in a nation,” by which he meant that the bad consequences that are foreseeable will take longer to destroy a polity than you would expect. We see that often enough. How many of us have expected the US monetary system to collapse due to mounting debt? No doubt, at some point, it will, unless we straighten up and fly right. \n\nBut who knows when? The US is still a great place to invest, has a skilled workforce, an unmatched military, and everywhere else is worse. So it continues. \n\nI suspect that New York City is much the same. Mamdani's policies will harm the city grievously, but I suspect it is so vital that it will plod along doing pretty well, with Mamdani throwing a lot of sand in the gears without creating either a communist utopia as he promises, or a communist hell we all fear. \n\nI'm not shrugging. It's horrible that he won, and he will make things worse. But I have this sense that New York City is too big and strong to kill, at least not in the short term. I get the sense that he is like a lone lion attacking an elephant. Not good. The elephant may get some damage, but unless a substantial pride attacks, the elephant is likely to survive the experience with only some scars. \n\nI hope that New York City is more a herd of elephants than one roaming alone, and that Mamdani's pride of lions is not as great as they believe. I suspect, and believe, that New York City will outlast even a communist mayor. Scarred, maybe badly, but it's hard to kill.\n\nEditor’s Note: Every single day, here at Hot Air, we will stand up and FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT against the radical left and deliver the conservative reporting our readers deserve.

        "text": "President Donald Trump’s exceedingly warm reception of New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani at the White House last week left observers attempting to decipher what it all meant. To longtime Trump watchers, it showed the popularity-hungry president responding to a charismatic winner; to one anti-monopolist, it showed a potential alliance between left and right populists; to a hyperlocal New York newspaper, it showed two men from Queens getting together. To South Asians and third culture kids, the encounter showed an immigrant son of the Indian diaspora flexing a very familiar and particular skill — one likely honed over years of uncomfortable interactions with paternalistic elders. “Desis have found Mamdani’s polite smile, respectful head tilt and general mollifying of Trump kick in a very particular muscle memory – of tactical deference to Aunties and Uncles whose lectures they actually have zero intention of obeying,” Times of India journalists opined in a recent editorial, referring to people with roots in the Indian subcontinent. “What Zohran did was not extraordinary statesmanship or youthful rebellion but simply the oldest trick in our collective cultural book, the desi art of letting the elder talk while quietly keeping the steering wheel of our own intent,” Indian diarist Kedar Gadgil mused on LinkedIn. “We’re disruptors, but we are managing to maintain respect for our elders. We’re learning how to play into the system that has raised us,” Yamuna Meleth, an actor and singer who was raised in Alabama by Indian immigrants, said in an interview. “I think that is Desi training.” CNN reached out to Mamdani’s team to ask about this assessment. But whether Mamdani perfected this art as a result of his immigrant upbringing, whether it was meticulous preparation on behalf of his staff or whether he simply caught the previously hostile president in a good mood is besides the point. Fellow South Asians saw something familiar in Mamdani’s Oval Office demeanor: his uncharacteristically subdued smile, his respectful yet uncompromising tone and his deft deflections of questions intended to highlight his and Trump’s fundamental disagreements. Meleth said Mamdani’s behavior toward Trump reminded her of fielding unsolicited advice from aunties and uncles growing up. “There is a patience that is instilled in you and a sort of acceptance, almost like you’re trained to let it go in one ear and out the other,” she added. The trick, in her experience, is “letting them gas you up and to let them think that they have something to do with your success.” In his meeting with the president, Mamdani appeared to do just that. When asked if New York City loved Trump, he immediately pivoted to his signature message about affordability while acknowledging that New Yorkers shifted toward Trump in 2024 because of his campaign’s focus on cost of living. Trump, in turn, seemed delighted at the media’s interest in the meeting and tried to play up their perceived similarities. “Some of his ideas really are the same ideas that I have,” he said at one point. At another, “I want him to do a great job, and we’ll help him do a great job.” As Mamdani faced criticism from some on the left for meeting with Trump, others praised what they saw as the mayor-elect’s ability to disarm a notoriously contentious figure without getting defensive or compromising his values. In doing so, he undercut the right’s attempt to paint him as a communist jihadist and tamped down fears of the National Guard being deployed to New York City — at least for now. Gadgil likened this ability to a dance that South Asians are especially practiced in. “Eventually you start leading without the other person realizing that you were following just a moment ago,” he said. “To an outsider, it looks like a very choreographed piece.” Afshana Haque, a Houston-based therapist who specializes in South Asian clients, characterized Mamdani’s dynamic with Trump as “very similar to how we navigate maybe aunties at a party telling us about who to marry and what color their skin should be and what career to have, and yet being polite about it.” While Western societies tend to favor clear, direct communication, Haque said non-Western cultures often view such explicitness as disrespectful, meaning people with roots in those cultures learn to strike a delicate balance between appeasing a difficult elder and staying true to oneself. “Growing up, for many of us, it was very upsetting, annoying, frustrating that we even had to do that. It takes a lot of mental energy and emotional energy at times,” Haque said. “But what is so beautiful about all of this is seeing how these can be strengths for us and can help us navigate worlds.” Mamdani’s charm offensive on Trump was notable considering the confrontational turns that the president’s meetings with other high-profile leaders have taken. In February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s White House visit escalated into a shouting match, with Trump and Vice President JD Vance chiding him for not being sufficiently grateful for US support in the country’s war against Russia. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s Oval Office appearance in May ended in a similar ambush as Trump tried to falsely accuse him of enabling white genocide. One way of understanding all of these interactions might be that Trump is acting in his own political interest, and that striking a friendly tone with Mamdani last week was the most advantageous maneuver at the time. But for many South Asian observers, the uncle disarmament strategy is not to be dismissed.",

        "text": "Lawrence O’Donnell completely shredded President Trump while breaking down what the MS NOW TV personality described as Trump’s “political surrender” to Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on Friday. \n\n“There is no more vivid image of the decline and fall of Donald Trump than the image that was created on Friday with Donald Trump slumped in the Oval Office at the desk in defeat offering a political surrender to the man who stood beside him in the Elon Musk position,” O’Donnell said during Monday night’s segment of “The Last Word.” “A man 20 years younger than Elon Musk and immeasurably smarter. A man who took over that room as no one before him has ever taken over that room with Donald Trump in it.”\n\nO’Donnell was referring to Trump’s Friday meetup with his political opponent Mamdani, whom he’s continuously slammed as “communist” in the past, at least until now. Both of the politicians have gone back and forth with name-calling, with Mamdani even being questioned about if he still believes that Trump is a “fascist.”\n\nWatch the clip below.\n\n“Donald Trump went from calling the man a communist lunatic to glad-handing him publicly like one of Donald Trump’s beloved dictators,” O’Donnell carried on. “What we saw on Friday was Donald Trump offering an unconditional surrender. Donald Trump has not completed his first year in the second term of his presidency and he knows he is losing so badly now that he desperately has to do something and he has no idea what to do.”\n\nO’Donnell argued that Trump’s chat with Mamdani was held in an effort to clear up any mess he might’ve made, especially with his recent “punishable by death” remarks towards Democrats.\n\n“After calling for the death penalty for members of Congress who simply publicly stated military law, saying that members of the military must not follow illegal orders, even Donald Trump could figure out how insane that comment was,” O’Donnell said. “And so, Donald Trump desperately needed to do something to change the tone. And the next person in the door was the person he called a communist lunatic.”\n\nO’Donnell went on to say that despite Trump claiming that it would be a “total economic and social disaster” if Mamdani won his election, he welcomed Mamdani into the Oval Office because he, himself is losing his presidential throne.\n\n“And because Donald Trump cannot put his positions in the English language, he thought that the symbol of the new young mayor-elect and Donald Trump getting along, the symbol of Donald Trump getting along with the affordability guy would work for Donald Trump. It was pure pathetic losing political calculation by a loser.”",

        "text": "New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani announced a new economic and workforce development transition team that will be headed by, among others, reparations activist Darrick Hamilton, who argues the U.S. economy and governmental policies related to it are racist. Hamilton, who went to Oberlin College and later the University of Carolina at Chapel Hill, is the founding director of the Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy at the progressive The New School university in New York City. Hamilton's academic biography at The New School calls him a \"pioneer\" in the field of \"stratification economics,\" which is aimed at looking at how race and ethnicity are embedded into \"inequality\" in education, economic and health outcomes. Mamdani announced Monday the creation of more than 17 transition advisory committees made up of more than 400 people to help advise his incoming administration, including the Committee on Economic Development & Workforce Development, which Hamilton will help lead. MAMDANI'S TOP INCOMING AIDE WAS ‘CHIEF ARCHITECT’ OF RADICAL PROPOSAL OVERHAULING NYPD \"Since our nation’s inception, the immoral devaluation of Black lives has been ingrained in America’s political economy, and (has) manifested in a persistent, unjust, and enormous racial wealth gap,\" Hamilton told Congress in 2021. \"Our unjust racial wealth gap is itself an implicit measure of our racist past that is rooted in a history in which whites have been privileged by (a) government complicit (in) political and economic intervention(s) that have afforded them access to resources and iterative and intergenerational accumulation.\" Hamilton also sits on the New York State Community Commission on Reparations Remedies, where he advises members of the New York State legislature on policy recommendations for \"reparative justice,\" as it relates to \"the historical and present-day consequences of slavery and discrimination.\" One proposal Hamilton is known for is socioeconomic-based \"Baby Bonds,\" which would essentially establish racially conscious trust funds for children. The Baby Bonds would be given a certain amount of seed funding depending upon determined need, and would grow until the kids become adults and can use the money. Hamilton has argued that one-time reparations payments do not go far enough and steps, such as the Baby Bonds proposal, should be taken to help Black folks garner ownership of \"means of production in American society.\" Meanwhile, Hamilton has been criticized for allegedly wanting to add Black immigrants to reparations policies, as opposed to making them exclusively for the descendants of slavery. Yvette Carnell, a prominent activist and co-founder of the American Descendants of Slavery (ADOS) movement, has also called Hamilton \"clueless\" and accused the scholar of kowtowing to whichever politician is in power. \"The racial wealth gap is such that the typical Black family has about 10 cents on the dollar as a typical white family,\" Hamilton said during a 2020 podcast episode on Freakonomics Radio. \"That history of racial disparity, as it relates to wealth-building, certainly didn’t end with slavery,\" Hamilton added. \"There was the Homestead Act. There was the G.I. Bill. There was a system of sharecropping. There’s a system of Jim Crow. There is a system of redlining. It was government-facilitated.\" UNEARTHED ANTISEMITIC, ANTI-ISRAEL POSTS FROM MAMDANI AIDE SPARK GOP OUTRAGE During a separate appearance on The Black News Channel, Hamilton also said he is not one to \"compromise\" on policy either, when asked why Democrats are always \"compromising with crazy people.\" \"I don't like the word compromise … because one thing we know is that when we think about race, the group that is typically the first to be compromised are the issues related to those that are most marginalized, which in the United States' context has been Black people,\" Hamilton said during the 2021 Black News Chanel interview. \"We need government to start doing good,\" Hamilton continued, \"because when people realize the government can do good it creates a momentum, a movement forward that makes it harder for us to turn back.\" Other folks tapped for Mamdani's new Committee on Economic Development and Workforce Development include Gustavo Gordillo, co-chair of the New York City chapter of Democratic Socialists of America, and Deyanira Del Río, executive director of the New Economy Project, which she has said on the record is \"dedicated to building an economy … rooted in racial and gender justice, neighborhood equity and ecological sustainability.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Not long after Mamdani won his election and began nominating members to his transition team, he faced backlash for staffing his team with aides from former NYC mayoral campaigns, ranging from Bill de Blasio, to Michael Bloomberg to Eric Adams. Mamdani also tapped a longtime Biden adviser to help lead his transition that garnered criticism. \"The polls have barely closed, and already the incoming mayor is breaking one of his core promises to shake up the status quo and usher in a new day. New York City started a downward spiral under the de Blasio administration, and now some of its main players are returning to the halls of power,\" Republican strategist Colin Reed told Fox News Digital. \"And former FTC Chair Lina Khan became synonymous with her hostility toward businesses large and small during the Biden administration and one of the ringleaders of Bidenomics.\" Neither Mamdani's team, nor Hamilton, responded to Fox News Digital's requests for comments in time for publication.",

A bill introduced by Councilwoman Nantasha Williams (D-Queens) would raise members’ salaries from $148,500 to $172,500, the New York Post reported Tuesday. If passed, the pay hike would also apply to the new mayor, public advocate, comptroller, and borough presidents. It would put Mamdani’s pay at nearly $300,000, up from the current $258,000, the outlet said. NYC MAYOR-ELECT MAMDANI ASKS SUPPORTERS FOR $4M TO FUND TRANSITION, VOWS NO WEALTHY DONORS Other top officials, such as the comptroller, public advocate, and borough presidents, would see comparable increases. The legislation would be introduced this week with a hearing by year’s end, allowing the next City Council to vote in January for a swifter approval. The last raise for Council members occurred in 2016. Interestingly, it was Mamdani who built out a platform centered on affordability for working-class New Yorkers. FOX NEWS' MARTHA MACCALLUM TO INTERVIEW NEW YORK MAYORAL CANDIDATE ZOHRAN MAMDANI The Ugandan-born 34-year-old pledged free buses, rent freezes on rent-stabilized apartments, universal childcare, and city-run grocery stores during his campaign for New York City mayor. He also campaigned on a gradual increase of the minimum wage to $30 an hour by 2030. Mamdani has said these proposals would be funded primarily by raising taxes on wealthy individuals and large corporations. As a state assembly member in 2022, Mamdani also voted for a pay raise for state legislators. MAMDANI LAUGHS OFF CRITICISM THAT HIS TAX HIKE PROPOSALS WILL COMPEL NEW YORKERS TO FLEE The latest NYC pay hike plans were originally set to go to Mayor Eric Adams’ desk, but that schedule was shelved, according to the Post. \"If we have a hearing on the bill this year, we don’t need a hearing on it next year. It’s pre-considered,\" Williams told The Post. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP When the outlet asked her if the council would pass the pay hike bill in January, Williams responded, \"That’s the goal.\" A source also said that the pay hike legislation puts Mamdani in a predicament: he could veto the bill or approve a law \"making New York more affordable for the political class,\" they said.

        "text": "A clique of Democratic senators who have dubbed themselves the “Fight Club” is demanding Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and the party’s official campaign organization take a hands-off approach to next year’s midterm elections.\n\nThe group of rabble-rousers is accusing Schumer (D-NY) and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) Chair Kristen Gillibrand (D-NY) of meddling in favor of so-called “establishment” candidates and wants them to be neutral. \n\nBut a source who was involved with arranging an early “Fight Club” meeting claims that the clique has quickly devolved into a “one big, giant mess” of pols angling to get credit with the Democratic base. \n\n“[Sen.] Tina [Smith] first conceived the idea to engage the New York Times and then the club turned sort of dysfunctional,” the source told The Post. “The biggest fight in the club is among the comms teams. No staffer trusts each other, and they’re looking for ways to get their boss maximum credit with the left.”\n\n“It’s one big, giant mess. Senator [John] Thune has something to be thankful for this Thanksgiving because more leaks are coming. It’s way beyond Chuck Schumer at this point. It’s dysfunction.”\n\nThe group — whose members include Sens. Smith (D-Minn.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — are particularly concerned about perceived DSCC meddling in heated primary contests in Maine, Michigan and Minnesota, according to the New York Times\n\n“We have a lot of good candidates out there, and the DSCC has seemed to put their foot on the scale in favor of the more establishment candidates as opposed to some of these, you know, other candidates,” Van Hollen told “CNN News Central” Tuesday.\n\n“It’s fine to support a Sherrod Brown [of Ohio] who was recruited into a race, but there are many active and open Senate Democratic primaries,” he added. “It’s our view that for the most part these should play out without interference from the Senate Democratic leadership.”\n\nThe existence of the “fight club” is the latest sign of rank-and-file discontent with Schumer, who has led the Senate Democratic caucus since 2017.\n\nA spokesperson for Schumer downplayed concerns about infighting and stressed that the minority leader’s priority is ensuring Democrats can flip the Senate in 2026.\n\n“Our North Star has always been winning the Senate majority in 2026 and any decision is made towards achieving that goal,” a Schumer spokesperson told The Post. “Sen. Schumer is focused more on winning than ideology when deciding who to support.”\n\nWhile the DSCC hasn’t officially made endorsements in any of the three contentious Senate primaries, the group is speculated to favor Maine Gov. Janet Mills, Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Mich.), and Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.)\n\n“I think it needs a rebrand, because it’s more like ‘Never Won a Real Fight Club,’ because these are a bunch of people who have never been engaged or never themselves been in a really competitive race,” a Democratic strategist who’s been involved with Senate campaigns vented to The Post.\n\nThis source noted that some of the “Fight Club” members benefited from interventions by prior Democratic leaders when they were campaigning for the Senate.\n\n“All of these things are hypocrisy at a minimum, but they are also campaign malpractice,” the source added, arguing it undercuts the push to get “the best candidate.”\n\nLast week, six senators — including three members of the “fight club” — cut a video endorsing Minnesota Lt. Gov.

After seven Democrats and one Dem-aligned independent caved earlier this month and allowed the record-breaking 43-day government shutdown to end, Schumer faced blowback again from his left flank.\n\nNo sitting Democratic senator has called for new elections for Senate leader, but others — including House Democrats like Rep. Ro Khanna of California and insurgent Maine Senate candidate Graham Platner have called for new leadership.\n\nPublicly, Van Hollen has been among the Democratic senators most willing to publicly cross party leadership.\n\nIn September, he lashed out at Democratic leaders for dragging their feet on endorsing now-NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.\n\n“The DSCC is focused on winning Senate seats and flipping the majority in 2026, and our strategy is guided by the best way to do that,” DSCC spokesperson Maeve Coyle told the New York Times.\n\nSmith’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

        "text": "Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said she isn’t “interested in a bromance with the federal regime” days after New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s chummy visit with President Trump.\n\nThe progressive Democrat — whose policies Mamdani has praised — told local news outlets Monday she wasn’t looking to replicate Mamdani and President Trump surprisingly buddy-buddy tone in a White House meeting Friday.\n\n“From my point of view, flattery is not the way,” Wu said at a Thanksgiving drive when asked if she’d accept a similar invitation, according to the Boston Herald.\n\n“Boston residents want us to stand strong on our values and to get things done and to keep moving forward, and that’s what we’re going to continue to do.”\n\nWu, whose national profile has grown since she took office in 2021, has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration and slammed his crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\nMamdani, who shares similar policy positions with Wu, slammed Trump as a “fascist” during his mayoral campaign, but the pair were complimentary and cordial during the mayor-elect’s visit to the Oval Office.\n\nThe Queens democratic socialist, 34, carefully avoided praising Trump, but stressed the two talked about how they can both help New Yorkers. \n\nWhen reporters asked Mamdani about previous insults the state lawmaker leveled against Trump, the president even ran interference for him.\n\nWu, 40, said she would only meet with Trump if the federal government met various conditions.\n\n“If it came with a promise to stop snatching residents illegally off the streets, stop prosecuting his political enemies, stop cutting life saving research and funding?” she said, per the Boston Globe.\n\n“Sure, I would be open to a conversation at that point.”\n\nBut she also made clear every city and its leaders have a different calculus when dealing with the White House.\n\n“Every community has their unique and individual contexts, and every city leader, every university, every law firm, has to make their own decisions about how they handle this moment,” Wu said, according to reports.\n\n“On my part, I am fighting as hard as I possibly can to stop the actions of a federal government that seems intent on attacking its own people.”\n\nWhen reached for comment about Wu’s remarks, Mamdani’s transition campaign referred The Post to comments the incoming Hizzoner made on “Meet the Press.”\n\n“I think working for the people of New York City demands that you work with everyone and anyone, and that you always look to find those areas of agreement while not overlooking the places of disagreement,” he said on the Sunday morning show.",

        "text": "MS NOW’s Lawrence O’Donnell used his monologue on Monday’s “The Last Word” to show viewers the photo he said perfectly captures Donald Trump’s rapidly diminishing strength.\n\n“There is no more vivid image of the decline and fall of Donald Trump than the image that was created on Friday with Donald Trump slumped in the Oval Office at the desk in defeat, offering a political surrender to the man who stood beside him,” O’Donnell said, referencing Trump’s meeting with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.\n\nNew York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and Donald Trump meet in the Oval Office on Nov. 21.\n\nBefore Friday’s Oval Office meeting, many expected the democratic socialist and the Republican president to clash. However, following a private conversation, the president heaped praise on the incoming mayor, telling reporters he was “very confident” that Mamdani would do a “very good job.”\n\nAs O’Donnell pointed out, before the mayoral election, Trump had threatened to withhold federal funds from New York City if Mamdani was elected. But on Friday, Trump backtracked on that threat.\n\nThe MS NOW host called Trump’s flip-flop “a complete surrender” and described it as “the kind of reversal a politician offers only in defeat.”\n\nO’Donnell said the reason behind Mamdani’s warm reception at the White House wasn’t because Trump was “charmed by his smile,” arguing it was instead a political calculation by the president.\n\n“Donald Trump is losing, and Donald Trump knows it,” he said. O’Donnell suggested Trump was using Mamdani as a “political sign” to show the American people that he understands the issue that was at the center of the mayor-elect’s campaign: affordability. \n\nHowever, according to O’Donnell, the president’s play did not pay off. “It was pure, pathetic, losing political calculation by a loser — by a president who presided over a party that just had its worst Election Day imaginable.”\n\nO’Donnell said the optics of Trump’s Oval Office display showed his supporters that he is losing his political “superpowers” — and not only that, but “losing in a confrontation with a 34-year-old politician running in his first important election.”\n\n“The young man beat the old man, and the old man formally surrendered to the young man — and did it on TV,” O’Donnell said. “That image captures the decline and fall of Donald Trump as no other image has yet captured.”\n\nYou can watch O’Donnell’s full analysis in the clip at the top of the page.",

Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who oversees the party’s Senate campaign arm and has shaped its roster of preferred candidates.\n\nTheir uprising reflects something deeper than personal irritation. It mirrors a long-simmering frustration among Democratic voters who believe that party leaders have failed to project a clear, ambitious vision or to demonstrate a real appetite for political combat. \n\nAs the Times reports, these senators are fed up with the way Schumer and Gillibrand have selected and boosted establishment-aligned contenders whom they see as uninspired at best and self-sabotaging at worst.\n\nThe cracks have shown back home in New York, where neither Schumer nor Gillibrand endorsed Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist. But Mamdani didn’t just win; he routed former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, a result that has only sharpened questions about what, exactly, the party’s leaders are afraid of.\n\nThis early-stage rebellion is remarkable in itself. Schumer has long faced grumbling from within his caucus, but the emergence of an organized faction willing to openly challenge him signals something more serious—a belief that sticking with the status quo could cost Democrats the majority.\n\nThe “Fight Club” senators insist that their quarrel isn’t about ideology so much as posture. Party leaders, the senators argue, are still working from a playbook written for a different era. In their view, that approach is bleeding energy from a base that wants candidates who will stand up to the Trump administration and stop tiptoeing around the party’s more cautious instincts.\n\nBesides Sanders and Warren, the group reportedly includes Sens. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Tina Smith of Minnesota, and Chris Murphy of Connecticut. Others—Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico—have also joined conversations. \n\nTheir attention is now trained on several open Senate primaries in Minnesota, Michigan, and Maine. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee hasn’t issued formal endorsements, but the group worries that its silence amounts to a tacit blessing for more moderate picks, like Maine’s Janet Mills.\n\nSchumer’s office flatly rejects the idea of a brewing schism. \n\n“Our North Star is winning the Senate majority in 2026, and any decision is made to achieve that goal,” spokesperson Alex Nguyen told the Times.\n\nEven so, the Times notes that the “Fight Club” may endorse candidates who differ from those favored by the official campaign arm—a sign that the caucus’s center of gravity is shifting.\n\nIts first joint action came quickly, with a video endorsing Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan in her primary against Rep. Angie Craig.\n\nFor now, though, the group’s plans remain fluid. It’s been workshopping ideas in person and on an active text chain: joint fundraising, shared donor lists, coordinated endorsements, and campaign appearances. \n\nNothing is locked in, but the intent is clear: They want to build leverage.\n\nThe discontent, of course, extends far beyond this faction. Schumer’s numbers have been weak for months. Polling routinely shows him underwater in his home state, and a recent Siena survey put his favorability at its lowest level in decades, with just 32% of New Yorkers offering a positive view.\n\nStill, the “Fight Club” isn’t preparing a direct assault on incumbents, nor does it plan to intervene in Ohio or North Carolina, where Schumer recruited former Sen. Sherrod Brown and former Gov. Roy Cooper. \n\nTheir argument is more straightforward: The DSCC should stay out of primaries altogether and let voters choose candidates without a thumb on the scale. Speaking as a bloc, they hope, makes that case harder for leadership to ignore.\n\nRelated | Can progressives ride Mamdani’s momentum into the midterms?\n\nNot that they agree on everything.\n\nIn Michigan—home to one of the cycle’s highest-stakes Democratic primaries—Sanders and Heinrich landed on different endorsed candidates. But the broader point stands: They believe that Schumer’s approach to elections is uninspired and increasingly out of step with their voters.\n\nAnd the catalyst for this rebellion traces back to Schumer’s decision not to endorse Mamdani.\n\nNow a cluster of progressive senators is putting muscle behind the frustration that’s been simmering on the left for months. Whether their push forces Schumer to bend—or triggers a much bigger fight—remains the open question hanging over the party’s next chapter.",

The Muslim mayor-elect stood by his previous comments calling the president a “fascist” and a “despot”—refusing to back down when pressed by reporters on his statements.\n\nThe president even came to his aid, surprising everyone when he told Mamdani not to answer a question about calling Trump a fascist. “That’s OK, you can just say yes,” Trump said. “It’s easier than explaining it. I don’t mind.”\n\nFriedland remarked on this exchange, asking Mamdani how he kept a straight face during the press conference. \n\n“We were all dying, and I’m like, my boy Zohran was like, straight face. [Trump] said, ‘Just tell them yes,” Friedland said. “How’d you keep that face?”\n\nMamdani smiled, telling Friedland, “Honestly, I was just thinking about New York City.”\n\nThe president had previously called Mamdani a “communist lunatic” and “not very smart.” But Trump called Friday’s meeting “very good” and “productive,” highlighting that the two had a lot more in common than they thought.\n\nTrump, 79, said he would “absolutely” feel comfortable living in New York City under Mamdani, and even rebuked MAGA faithful New York governor hopeful Elise Stefanik, who called Mamdani a “jihadist.”\n\nWhen asked if he agreed with Stefanik’s assessment of Mamdani, he replied, “No, I don’t. She’s out there campaigning. You say things sometimes on a campaign.”\n\nMamdani’s effort to meet with the president proved a success when Trump backed down from sending federal troops into the city—a significant reversal of his previous stance to “clean up the crime” and “save New York City.”",

        "text": "At least three times a week — and sometimes more — a big story will come out of New York about an awful crime that was committed against an innocent by a criminal who, too often, shouldn't have been walking the streets anyway due to a rap sheet as long as a CVS receipt. \n\nEven just scrolling down the front page of RedState, you can see this story published on Monday that reported that someone stabbed someone else on the New York subway because a person asked them not to talk on their cell phone so loudly. \n\nRead: Meanwhile, NYC Subway Rider Stabbed After Asking Attacker to Stop Talking Loudly on Cellphone\n\nCharming city. \n\nAnd it's about to get even better, because incoming New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani just added a man named Alex Vitale to his transition team. \n\nWho is Alex Vitale? He's the guy who says that if you \"don't want racism and violence, don't get the police involved.\" \n\nAlex Vitale — author of The End of Policing, sociology professor at Brooklyn College, CUNY Graduate Center, and now officially part of Zohran Mamdani’s transition team on “community safety” — gave this talk eleven days before George Floyd, when “defund” hadn’t even gone mainstream. He was already a true believer.\n\nHe also said that \"police are a direct interference\" with \"radical socialist oriented politics\" that will be \"used to stop us.\" \n\nProfessor Alex Vitale, now on Mamdani’s transition team, says the quiet part out loud, admitting that abolishing the police “creates political space for us to do what we need to do.”\n\nRecently, Mamdani said during his debate with Andrew Cuomo that he has no intention to defund the police, but it's kind of hard to take that kind of talk seriously when he's putting someone on his transition team who is openly hostile to the mere concept of policing. \n\nIf you need more proof that he wasn't just rattling off anti-police rhetoric to his socialist friends, keep in mind that Vitale is the author of the book \"The End of Policing,\" in which he advocates for dramatically reducing the budgets and duties of police departments and putting that money into more socialistic ventures like social workers. \n\nI think it's safe to say that Mamdani wasn't at all serious about not wanting to defund the police. He just brought in one of the biggest \"defund the police\" guys there is. \n\nThis is going to spell doom for the NYPD, and that's before Mamdani and Vitale can actually get their hands on it. As I reported in June, officers of the NYPD were already preparing for a mass exodus if Mamdani won: \n\n“The city would be totally unsafe for people who live here,” predicted Scott Munro, president of the NYPD Detectives’ Endowment Association.“I go to bed and worry about the phone ringing. I’m worried about my members getting killed. I don’t want to plan any funerals,” he added.“If you put a guy like him in there, our people are going to get hurt, and nobody’s going to want the job. It’s going to put recruitment back five more steps,” Munro said.NYPD brass are quietly bracing for a potential mass exodus unless Mayor Adams, a Democrat and retired NYPD captain seeking re-election as an independent, or GOP mayoral nominee Curtis Sliwa, pull off an upset. [As we know, that did not happen.]“I’ve had guys call me and say ‘If he wins, I’m quitting,’” a police source said of Mamdani. “It’s just weird that New York City would vote for him. I know he’s not here for the police.”\n\nRead: New York Is Going to Have Some Major Crime Problems If Mamdani Wins the Mayor's Race\n\nMunro is correct. The NYPD was already bleeding officers before Mamdani won the election, but I'm not entirely sure how the NYPD will stay near battle-ready now. Officers will likely cut and run to other departments outside the city, or possibly even move to different states, and rightly so. It's highly unlikely that Mamdani's regime will have officers' backs, and no one wants to be the next Derek Chauvin. \n\nNew Yorkers better brace for impact. Or better yet, leave. \n\nEditor’s Note: Zohran Mamdani is an avowed Democratic Socialist and has a real chance to become the next mayor of New York City.\n\nHelp us continue to report on his radical communist views and expose the Democrats who support him.

        "text": "THE DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION—New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has appointed a university professor who has described police officers as “violence workers” to serve on his community safety committee.\n\nMamdani announced Monday that Alex Vitale, a sociology professor at Brooklyn College, will advise his incoming administration on community safety matters. Vitale has a long history of disparaging police, calling them the “natural enemy” of the working class, and advocating for defunding law enforcement.\n\nThe appointment casts fresh doubt on the mayor-elect‘s attempt to distance himself from his own past remarks calling for the defunding of the New York Police Department (NYPD), which he labeled a “racist, anti-queer and a major threat to public safety.” \n\nVitale referred to individual officers as “class enemies” during a 2020 interview with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) when asked where police fit into the “class struggle.”\n\nHis 2017 book, “The End of Policing,” argues that the “problem is not police training, police diversity, or police methods. The problem is policing itself.”\n\n“The whole point is they’re violence workers. You can’t train them not to be violence workers,” Vitale said during a separate 2020 interview in which he argued that police cannot be reformed.\n\nLike Mamdani, Vitale has stated that the “institution of policing exists historically to facilitate racial inequality… emerging out of colonialism, slavery, and industrial capitalism.”\n\nThe professor also advocates decriminalizing so-called “sex work” or prostitution and produced a 2025 film titled “Sex Work: It’s Just a Job.”\n\nVitale is one of roughly 400 advisors who will serve across 17 committees ahead of Mamdani’s January inauguration.\n\n“A love for hard work, a deep belief in the promise of New York City, and a commitment to the affordability agenda that New Yorkers are demanding unite the more than 400 experts we have appointed to our Transition Committees today,” Mamdani said on Monday. \n\n“By helping us recruit top talent and develop smart policy, these committees will be instrumental to ensuring we hit the ground running on Jan. 1—and that our results align with the promises we’ve made.”\n\nMamdani has insisted in recent months that he no longer supports defunding the NYPD. He also apologized to officers during an October Fox News interview for past disparaging comments, saying he is committed to “representing the men and women of the NYPD.”\n\n“I apologize because of the fact that I’m looking to work with these officers, and I know that these officers, these men and women who serve in the NYPD, they put their lives on the line every single day,” Mamdani said.\n\nVitale’s views, however, are consistent with positions held by the DSA, of which Mamdani is a member. The group calls on the country to “end the criminalization of working-class survival,” “invest in community self-governance and care, not cops” and provide “freedom for all incarcerated people.”\n\n“For all of the working class to achieve collective liberation, we must constrain, diminish, and abolish the carceral forces of the state — from prisons and police themselves, to their manifestations in all forms throughout society,” the DSA’s website says.\n\nAs recently as December 2024, Mamdani called for cuts to funding for the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group, the unit that responded to the killing of Officer Didarul Islam.\n\nMeanwhile, NYPD data shows that misdemeanors, “major” felonies and non-major felonies in New York City have been more frequent every year since 2020.\n\nNeither Mamdani nor Vitale responded to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\nOriginally published by The Daily Caller News Foundation.",

        "text": "A pack of Democratic senators and Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are forming a coalition against Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and his midterm strategy.\n\nThe group, dubbed the “Fight Club,” includes Sanders and Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Tina Smith of Minnesota, according to the New York Times (NYT). In addition to Schumer, the coalition’s ire is also aimed at the Senate Democratic Leader’s Empire State colleague, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who heads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), Senate Democrats’ campaign arm. (RELATED: Ditching Chuck Schumer Seems To Be Common Thread Among Many Democrats Running For Senate)\n\nThe Fight Club, whose existence was first reported by the NYT, seeks to directly challenge the way Schumer and Gillibrand have chosen and recruited Democratic Senate candidates, and argues their picks are more aligned with the party establishment. Schumer angered the party’s left-wing base after repeatedly declining to endorse New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, an avowed socialist aligned with the Sanders and Democrats’ left-flank, including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nThe group is discussing joint-fundraising efforts, lending their donor lists to candidates, offering endorsements and making appearances on the campaign trail, according to the NYT. They aim to focus on primaries for open seats in Maine, Michigan and Minnesota, where they believe leadership is pushing for Gov. Janet Mills, Rep. Haley Stevens and Rep. Angie Craig, respectively.\n\nTrump narrowly won Michigan in the 2024 presidential election, but he lost Maine and Minnesota.\n\nThe Fight Club, apart from Smith, publicly endorsed Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan for the Senate seat from which Smith is retiring. The Minnesota Senator has said she will not endorse a candidate in the primary race to succeed her.\n\nIn addition to Flanagan, Sanders prominently supports a pair of left-wing candidates, former public health official Abdul El-Sayed in Michigan and oyster farmer Graham Platner in Maine. Platner has notably joined other Democratic candidates in calling for Schumer’s ouster as Senate Democratic Leader.\n\nStevens also declined to answer whether she would vote for Schumer to lead the party if she was elected to the Senate.\n\nDemocratic Sens. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico have also joined in some of the Fight Club’s actions, according to the NYT. Markey is currently facing a competitive 2026 Democratic primary challenge from Democratic Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton.\n\nAlex Nguyen, a spokesperson for Schumer, told the NYT in a statement, “Our North Star is winning the Senate Majority in 2026 and any decision is made to achieve that goal.”\n\nSchumer’s approval ratings are their lowest in decades, according to a recent Siena Poll, and Democrats have repeatedly broken ranks to criticize the minority leader’s decisions.\n\nIn March, Schumer wrangled together enough Democrats to pass a stopgap funding bill and avert a government shutdown, infuriating his base who were hoping to make a stand against the Trump administration. Schumer again met the ire of his party when he failed to keep his caucus together, resulting in eight senators crossing the aisle to reopen the government after a 43-day shutdown — although Schumer himself still voted with the majority of his caucus to reject the shutdown-ending deal.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has sidestepped questions about the possibility of challenging Schumer in 2028 for years, but calls for her to mount a primary challenge to him have increased as public criticism of the Democratic leader mounts. Polls have also shown her with double-digit leads over the longtime senator.\n\nWhen she was asked in November if she would potentially run against Schumer in 2028, she punted the question, telling reporters, “That is years from now.”\n\nSens. Gillibrand, Warren, Sanders, Van Hollen, Murphy, Smith, Markey, Merkley and Heinrich all did not respond to requests for comment by the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

        "text": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nWhile President Donald Trump held a lovefest for New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in the Oval Office last week, the right flank of his party was promptly freaking out. “Wild to allow a jihadist communist to stand behind the president’s desk in the Oval Office,” Laura Loomer, conspiracy theorist and unofficial Trump adviser, lamented on X. She was not the only one lacing her criticism of Trump’s meeting with Mamdani with outright bigotry that targeted the mayor-elect’s Muslim faith. Prior to Trump’s meeting, Republicans had actually strategized around making Mamdani—and his Muslim background—a serious political target going forward.\n\nThe consequences of that targeting have been frightening. Islamophobia has skyrocketed ever since Mamdani’s primary upset in June, and experts are predicting that it will get even worse next year as his first term as mayor collides with a contentious midterm season.\n\nIslamophobia is an age-old theme in American politics, peaking some 20 years ago in the aftermath of 9/11 and ebbing and flowing in the years since. It was largely viewed as fringe and extreme, but those in positions of power were reasonably quick to condemn it. Even as he was launching a global war on terror that targeted Muslim countries and their civilian populations, Republican President George W. Bush still felt it important to proclaim “Islam is peace” in the days following the 9/11 attacks. America’s political landscape has dramatically shifted since that speech was delivered, and nowadays, as we face a hyperpolarized electorate, racist and bigoted rhetoric is becoming the norm.\n\nTo understand the depth of the problem, Equality Labs, a South Asian civil rights advocacy group, analyzed social media activity that specifically targeted Mamdani from his June primary win through October. The group’s final report detailed how there were over 17 million posts circulated across 12 different platforms that amplified disinformation and hate speech targeting Mamdani. Even more alarming, Equality Labs identified more than 45 Republican officials from across 18 states who amplified this rhetoric.\n\nThis tracks when you consider that about a month ago, the National Republican Congressional Committee sent out a midterms strategy memo outlining how the national GOP strategy will tie “every House Democrat” to Mamdani’s “anti-American agenda, and the NRCC will weaponize it against them.” Digital ads implementing this strategy have already hit the airwaves, while plenty of Republicans have hit the ground running. New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, who recently announced she’s running for governor, called Mamdani a “jihadist” just last week. Trump, instead of condemning the comment, brushed it off during his meeting with Mamdani. “She’s out there campaigning. You say things sometimes in a campaign.” Trump would know, as he signed an executive order eight years ago explicitly banning immigrants from Muslim-majority countries and floated the idea of creating a national registry of Muslims, then turned around and courted Muslim American voters for his third bid for president.\n\nRep. Randy Fine announced he was actively working with the Trump administration “to fight this Muslim terrorist,” and went so far as to say, “Mamdani should be denaturalized and deported ASAP.” Republican Rep. Andy Biggs also suggested that Mamdani’s electoral win meant New York City would be transformed into an Islamic state. “We must stop the advancement of Sharia Law in its tracks. It has no place in our Republic.”\n\nThe reach of these messages is truly incomprehensible. Equality Labs estimated that terms like terrorist, jihadi, Islamist, and communist reached billions of people across news, social media, and other online platforms. “The volume, coordination, and repetition signal a deliberate strategy to nationalize a local race by weaponizing bigotry as a turnout engine,” the group’s report says.\n\nA different study from Stop AAPI Hate, a group that tracks hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, found similar results. Analyzing some 1,500 slurs targeted at Mamdani from October through November, the group found 91 percent of them disparaged his Muslim faith. “Overall, Islamophobic slurs targeting Mamdani saw an increase of 175 percent,” says the group.\n\nAs the midterms approach, we can look to the recent Nov. 4 elections to get a taste of what’s to come when Mamdani is not on the ballot. In Virginia, when Ghazala Hashmi was running to become lieutenant governor—she won her race and is now the first Muslim woman in the entire country to be elected to statewide office—her opponent, Republican John Reid, publicly described her as a “pro Hamas radical leftist” and suggested Mamdani was her “NYC twin.” And some 1,200 miles away in Minnesota, state Sen. Omar Fateh’s campaign said he was receiving a “steady stream of hate, racial and Islamophobic slurs,” as he waged a campaign for mayor of Minneapolis. The attacks culminated in his campaign office being vandalized with an Islamophobic message: “Somali Muslim—This warning is no joke.” Fateh ultimately finished in second place behind Democratic incumbent Mayor Jacob Frey, who did publicly condemn Islamophobia and the hate Fateh received.\n\nThe evidence is clear: The normalization of Islamophobia risks not only Mamdani’s future mayoral administration but is a threat to every South Asian elected official and voter across the country. What is unclear is what the Republican Party will do now thatTrump has seemingly had a change of heart around Mamdani. The response to the meeting has not been heartening, as it seems to reveal plenty of Republicans are happy to continue pandering racist and bigoted language if it means gaining political ground at the expense of the entire electorate, and especially South Asian Americans.",

        "text": "It’s been over ten years since Donald Trump came down that escalator and said the thing that we’re not supposed to say – that illegal immigration is not an act of love, except in the most appalling figurative sense, that too many illegal aliens are criminals in other ways beyond just being illegal aliens, and that they should all go home – yet, apparently, the smart people have failed to pay any attention to him since. Again and again, he does things and triumphs, leaving them baffled. They really don’t understand Donald Trump, not in the least. It’s remarkable. This guy is entirely transparent. He does the same thing again and again and again. Yet, when he does the same thing again and again and again, the smart set – which includes Democrats, regime media folks (to the extent that is different), and even some alleged conservatives – is stunned, staggered, and baffled and draws all the wrong conclusions. Which is fine with me. I like it when my opponents get my side wrong.\n\nWhat am I talking about in this particular case? This happens all the time, and there were a lot of cases of our betters not understanding Trump. Well, a few days ago, the President – I love hearing him called that as much as his opponents hate it – met with Zohran Mamdani, the communist mayor-elect of New York City, at the White House. The big shocker for people who aren’t paying attention and shouldn’t have been surprised was that Trump didn't act like a jerk to him. He played the gracious host. He was nice and polite, joking around, flattering, and generally not being aggressive or hostile to his guest. Well, Trump‘s critics were gravely disappointed. How could he not be aggressive and hostile to this guy? \n\nOf course, Donald Trump is aggressive and hostile to people at appropriate times. And here, I’m talking about the seditionist Democrat vets and ridiculous CIA clerks, who try to pretend they are the equal of vets, who are encouraging dumb 23-year-old barracks lawyers to ruin their lives with a term in Leavenworth and a bad conduct discharge to provide Democrats some performance art propaganda. The smart set is mad aboutTrump‘s very hostile reaction to that seditious blue falconry. But they’re also mad that Trump was nice to Mamdani. Mean is bad, but nice is also bad. It’s really weird that they’re mad about Trump, no matter what he does or how he does it. You might conclude that this is a game Trump can’t win, except Trump isn't playing their game. He’s the undisputed champion of the world at doing what Trump does.\n\nWe know why they’re objecting to Trump. It’s because they don’t like Trump. But what’s their explanation, because they have to fake an explanation? Some of the critics actually asserted that Donald Trump is somehow sympathetic to Zohran Mamdani’s lefty politics. They actually took Trump's courtesy and flattery as manifestations of his actual beliefs rather than as part of his playing this Instagram amateur. The idea that somehow the goofy commie foreigner that the dummies in the Big Apple elected to accelerate the ruin of their city is going to convert Donald Trump to the joys of Marxism is so stupid that it pains me to even address it. But that’s what they think. They think that Donald Trump’s going to go socialist, and their evidence is that he didn’t punch Ugandan Che in the pinko’s piehole. \n\nWhat the hell is wrong with these people? Do they not know anything about how Donald Trump works after all this time? Did they not internalize the things they have seen him do over the last decade? They have eyes but will not see. It’s remarkable. Is there anybody out there who actually believes that Donald Trump was doing anything but putting on a show with this guy? If they do, they’re dumb, and if they don’t, they think you’re dumb – this is the eternal question of American politics today.\n\nSo, what did Donald Trump win by not getting into a giant Scat Francisco sidewalk contest with the teen socialist heartthrob? He won by looking normal. Normal people out there don’t like politics. They don’t understand why pols have to hate each other in public. They like the idea that people on both sides of the aisle can shake hands and be friendly and polite. And Donald Trump gets it. Oh, he delivers the heat when he needs to. He knows how to own the libs. But he’s also a master of optics. He’s the king of public relations. And he has sensed that this is a moment to show unity, just like down the road, there’s going to be a moment to show Mamdani the Gucci loafer Trump‘s going to use to kick his butt.\n\nAgain, Trump is the undisputed champion of the world at this stuff, and he knew exactly what he was doing. He brought in a fresh, young, and popular Democrat ingenue, put him in a position as a supplicant – the guy looked like he was crawling to his elder for approval – and then acted measured, reasonable, and nice. Yeah, it was disappointing for a lot of the people who are disappointed in Trump, no matter what Trump does, but normal people probably took a look at this tableau and thought, “Good, it’s nice to see people talking about their differences rather than threatening to kill people.” Or, in the case of the Democrats’ perverted constituents, actually killing people.\n\nTrump did the same thing with Putin, and it hasn’t worked yet. He did the same thing with the Little Rocket Man, and we haven’t gone to war with North Korea. He did the same thing with MBS, which made everybody mad because apparently this Third World potentate allegedly acted like a Third World potentate to some Third World jihadi supporter and we’re supposed to care so much that we toss away a major ally. Oh, by the way, here’s a hint from a guy who had to persuade people as a job – the fact that someone was a WaPo journalist does not make me more sympathetic to him. Just saying.\n\nIn any case, Trump is nice to people whom the smart set says we’re not supposed to be nice to. Keep in mind, this is the same smart set with an unbroken track record of foreign policy and other failures over the last few decades. Trump, on the other hand, is ending wars left and right, winning fights when he is drawn into them, and has just happened to create Middle East peace, which no one else was able to do. Trump is racking up triumph after triumph. Is his record perfect? No. He hasn’t solved the Ukraine War yet, though it’s kind of odd that solving the Ukraine War is America’s problem, just like every problem around the world is apparently America’s problem. In this case, he’s done an amazing job, and his critics have, well, completely screwed up everything they put their soft little paws on.\n\nYou might think people would learn from how Trump succeeds while being consistently underestimated, because it happens over and over again. They decree that he’s a fool, an amateur, and a clown, and he comes back and triumphs where they failed. Right now, we have a bunch of people doom-mongering about the economy. They’re absolutely sure Trump’s going to lose the midterms. I’m not sure he’s going to lose the midterms. He certainly could. But that’s not set in stone. This is the guy who brings in wins that we never imagined possible. He brings in wins seemingly out of the blue when we were told he’s doomed. Holy cow, he just dispatched Marjorie Taylor Greene; where did that come from? We were told that her narcissistic chimp-out was going to tear us apart. We’re not torn apart, but she’s hitting the bricks. We’re told we’re going to lose the redistricting fight. The Texas abomination just got stayed, and I wouldn’t want to be a Penceophilic femboy Fredocon Indiana state senator right now. If you are one of those geniuses who is surprised that he’s turned defeat into victory, all I can suggest is that you pay closer attention to how this guy works. You’ve had a decade to learn how this guy works. Maybe you should try paying attention to him instead of whining about him all the time.\n\nLook, Donald Trump is a sui generis politician. There’s no one else like him, but he has patterns. He has habits. He has tactics, techniques, and procedures that he doesn’t bother to conceal. The guy’s totally transparent, yet he’s able to hide in plain sight. Why? To examine what he does is to take him seriously. To look at how he works is to concede that he’s not a fool, not a clown, not a hapless and feckless naif who somehow stumbles into victory after victory. They can’t treat him as somebody who’s an effective politician because that gives him credit and giving him credit is simply a bridge too far.\n\nTheir analysis is clouded by their hate, but that’s good. It gives him an advantage.

        "text": "New York made a huge mistake in electing Zohran Mamdani. But it seems the only way they'll learn is by suffering through the next four years of his socialist policies.\n\nThe biggest change will be in Mamdani's approach to crime. Frankly, New York doesn't have the best track record on that to begin with. Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg has a history of downgrading felonies to misdemeanors, maliciously prosecuting New Yorkers who defend themselves from the violent criminals who go through the revolving-door justice system.\n\nNow Mamdani's pick for his Criminal Legal Committe, Janos Marton, wants to make that situation even worse by freeing at least 80 percent of the city's prison and jail population.\n\nMamdani's CriminaI Legal Committee pick Janos Marton: \"Cut 80% of our prison, jail population\" pic.twitter.com/mRJ9IWwvyq— End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) November 25, 2025\n\nAccording to the video caption, Marton was also a candidate for Manhattan District Attorney and this was part of his campaign pitch to New Yorkers.\n\n\"How do we get this country to a place where we have one million fewer people in jail and prison?\" Marton said. \"Now, as it relates to Manhattan, I think we can be a little bit bolder than that. We are a supposedly liberal city with a ton of resources and a ton of ways to support people outside of jail and prison, and so I've called for cutting the Manhattan jail population by 80 percent.\"\n\nThis shows a fundamental misunderstanding of crimes and criminality. Criminals keep committing crimes because they face no consequences. Many of them are mentally ill, but some are just evil people who enjoy committing crimes. The only way to keep people safe is to put them in prison.\n\nEven if, in theory, providing them support and mental health resources in the community was a viable option, it doesn't work without strict enforcement. That is, policies have to be in place that mandate mentally ill people take medication, participate in therapy, and behave. Those policies have to be strictly enforced. \n\nInstead, the Left not only doesn't enforce criminal law, but it also refuses to enforce mandates on mental health services.\n\nOn top of that, Mamdani has also hired Alex Vitale, a radical anti-police abolitionist who wants to work on \"community safety.\"\n\nZohran \"I no longer want to abolish the NYPD\" Mamdani hires... *checks notes*... vocal police abolitionist Alex Vitale to work on \"community safety.\" https://t.co/l1kPxp9ilO— Rafael A.

A New Era for NYC. pic.twitter.com/JJBgJsvSpy— Alex Vitale (@avitale) November 24, 2025\n\nVitale is the author of 'The End of Policing,' a 2017 book in which Vitale advocates for reallocating funds from police to social services. Vitale argues that the \"function of police is to uphold inequalities of class, gender, race, or sexuality.\"\n\nAs we said above, the \"social services\" approach to crime doesn't work because the Left has no interest in mandating the use of medications, therapy, and group-home living situations that might address some of the issues driving crime (e.g. mental illness). It's a ruse for their ultmate goal: the destruction of America.\n\nAnd there's no better way to do that than to let criminals run amok in our cities.\n\nEditor’s Note: Zohran Mamdani, an avowed Democratic Socialist, will be the next mayor of New York City.\n\nHelp us continue to report on his radical communist views and expose the Democrats who support him.

        "id": 382178548,
        "text": "The analysis, which leverages anonymized financial data from Chase customers, suggests that the period of relying on pandemic-era excess cash liquidity is now “in the rearview mirror,” and many consumers are facing a spending season where budgets are “tempered by tepid income growth.” For consumers who are “relatively disadvantaged by high housing costs and hold less stock market wealth”—a group that disproportionately includes younger and lower-income individuals—they may have “justenough to spend, but not enough to splurge” this year.\n\nThese findings come at the end of a year when voter anger over the cost of living unseated Democrats from the White House and installed President Donald Trump for a second, nonconsecutive term, only to see voters back Democrats across the board in off-year elections. Many of the benefactors, including New York City Mayor–elect Zohran Mamdani, stressed the “affordability” problem that many are facing, while Trump’s approval ratings on the economy have plummeted.\n\nGen Z has born the brunt of what Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell memorably called a “low-hire, low-fire” labor market, where it’s looking pretty frozen. “Kids coming out of college and younger people, minorities, are having a hard time finding jobs,” Powell told reporters in September. Several weeks later, Goldman Sachs economists warned that “jobless growth” might become a permanent feature of the economy. Many economists have embraced a term from the Biden years that aligns with what JPMorgan is finding: “the K-shaped economy,” with diverging paths for wealthier and lower-income Americans.\n\nTo be sure, while JPMorgan’s report does not touch on the political scene and the affordability politics of 2025, it paints a picture of a tenuously balanced economic environment, full of friction with low real income and insufficient wealth accumulation among key demographics.\n\nReal income stagnation mirrors recessionary period\n\nMedian real income growth has sustained a weak trend for several months, with the October 2025 reading for prime-age individuals (ages 25–54) settling at only 1.6% in real terms. This low sustained pace is near the range observed during the weak labor market of the early 2010s, a period when the unemployment rate averaged 7%. This was, as the institute says, “when the unemployment rate was still elevated from the Great Recession,” although the current unemployment rate sits notably lower than in that period, at 4.3%.\n\nWhile nominal income growth remains roughly consistent with pre-pandemic levels, the higher pace of consumer price increases means real purchasing power gains are low.\n\nThis general stagnation is proving particularly challenging across demographics. Young people “continue to underperform the typical early career growth pattern” as income growth for individuals ages 25–29 is currently below historical trends for younger workers. Younger workers typically rely on job switching to rapidly advance their careers. However, the current slowdown in hiring is hindering this typical rapid pace of income advancement.\n\nThe downturn in overall income growth is also impacting older demographics. Workers ages 50–54 are now experiencing negative real year-over-year income growth. And since older workers generally face slower annual gains, a combination of weakening in the labor market and an uptick in inflation can more easily send their purchasing power into negative territory. Negative real growth for older workers can lead to challenging adjustments, particularly for lower-wealth individuals who have not benefited from years of strong gains in housing and stock prices.\n\nFlat balances offer little cushion\n\nHouseholds’ median real cash balances have remained flat since early 2024, holding steady throughout most of 2025. This stability marks a deviation from pre-pandemic trends, where real balances typically grew steadily at an annual rate of just over 6% as households aged. If balances had grown at that historical rate since 2020, they would be up 40% in October relative to 2019; instead, they are only up 23%.\n\nThis flat growth indicates that households are not accumulating additional cash reserves in their checking and savings accounts. \n\nAlthough high-income households have continued to see slight declines in their bank balances (only 2% negative in October 2025), potentially owing to transfers to higher-yield accounts or investment brokerage accounts, low-income households returned to positive year-over-year bank balance growth in September 2024. Despite these shifts in savings strategy, the approximation of total cash reserves—including investment transfers—shows that growth has been positive for all income groups for at least the past year.\n\nGoing into the end of the year, consumers with constrained budgets may look to stock market gains to augment spending. However, the report cautions that these stock market gains are “highly unequally distributed,” leaving younger and lower-income groups with less of a financial cushion as they navigate stagnant real purchasing power.\n\nFor this story, Fortune used generative AI to help with an initial draft.

        "text": "Happy Tuesday, and welcome to another edition of Rent Free. This week's stories include:\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass' persistent cowardice on housing.\nThe Department of Justice's antitrust settlement with RealPage.\nThe ROAD to Housing Act's frosty receptions in the House.\n\nKaren Bass Says the Key to Defeating NIMBYism Is Allowing Less Housing \n\nMy colleague Matt Welch has recorded an interview with L.A. Mayor Karen Bass for his Fifth Column podcast, which is well worth a listen for lots of reasons. Most relevant for this newsletter is the discussion of housing construction and NIMBYism in Los Angeles.\n\nI'd direct readers to one point about 35 minutes into the conversation, where Welch pushes Bass on why she came out against allowing people in the Palisades area to build duplexes on lands ravaged by this year's fires.\n\nBass' response is telling.\n\n\"Because the people in the Palisades didn't want that,\" says Bass. \"When it comes to building is that…I think you need to build with communities…I think that if you impose it on a neighborhood, then you will have hardcore NIMBYs.\"\n\n\"You're saying you're doing this to prevent NIMBYism, but doesn't that on some level just entrench it?\" responds Welch.\n\nThe two have a number of similar back-and-forths throughout the conversation. Bass continues to stick to this general worldview that the way to keep NIMBYism in check is to give a lot of ground to their opposition to new housing.\n\nWelch continually raises the (reasonable, in my opinion) counterpoint that you don't defeat NIMBYism by giving in to it.\n\nDuring her tenure as mayor, Bass has long expressed the view that new housing (and particularly subsidized affordable housing) is good, so long as City Hall doesn't allow too much of it.\n\nShe stood up a program called ED1 to streamline new housing production, and then worked to roll it back once the development applications flooded in.\n\nShe opposed S.B. 79, a state bill allowing more apartments near transit stops, for the similar reason that the city was losing its ability to more minutely control where new units should go and how many of them should be allowed.\n\nToday I signed a City Council resolution opposing SB79 unless it is amended to exempt cities with a state-approved and compliant Housing Element. \nWhile I support the intent to accelerate housing development statewide, as written, this bill risks unintended consequences for LA.\n— Mayor Karen Bass (@MayorOfLA) August 20, 2025\n\nIt's true that if you allow fewer homes in fewer places, fewer NIMBYs will express fewer objections to projects that aren't happening. The obvious takeaway, as Welch says repeatedly, is that you're defeating anti-development attitudes by defeating development.\n\nThat might be a sensible, middle-of-the-road position to take for a mayor looking to reduce headaches generated by land-use battles. But it also means housing-starved Los Angeles will see a lot fewer homes built.\n\nSometimes conflict is a necessary part of change. A mayor who wants to see her city become affordable would lean into those conflicts instead of shrinking from them.\n\nThe ROAD to Housing Act Hits a Speed Bump \n\nA bipartisan housing bill that sailed through the Senate is now facing an uncertain future in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe ROAD to Housing Act—an amalgam of mostly small housing policy tweaks to federal grant programs and financial regulations aimed at increasing housing production—passed the Senate as part of this year's National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) back in October.\n\nAs Politico reports today, however, House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill (R–Ark.) is holding up consideration of the NDAA until the housing provisions are stripped from it. Hill has been saying for the last week that he supports the ROAD to Housing Act, but some Republicans object to particular provisions. Therefore, he wants it considered as a standalone proposal.\n\nPer Politico, deals offered by Sens. Tim Scott (R–S.C.) and Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.)—the Senate Banking Committee chair and ranking member who shepherded the bill through the Senate—to keep the ROAD to Housing Act in the NDAA have been rejected.\n\nHousing advocates who support the bill are already attempting to manage expectations should it not pass before Congress adjourns for its December recess.\n\n\"We're optimistic that Congress may still advance ROAD to Housing provisions this year, but even if it doesn't, bipartisan momentum for housing reform remains strong,\" said the Bipartisan Policy Center's Dennis Shea in an emailed statement last week. \"With the House planning a December hearing on roadblocks to housing supply and a subsequent mark-up, prospects for meaningful action in 2026 are encouraging.\"\n\nYou can read Rent Free's coverage of the specifics of the ROAD to Housing Act here.\n\nThe DOJ and RealPage Turn Over a New Leaf \n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) has reached a provisional settlement in a major antitrust lawsuit it brought against real estate software company RealPage that alleged the company's products enabled landlords to illegally collude on price increases.\n\nRealPage's software, using a mix of public and nonpublic data on leases, rents, and vacancy rates, would recommend profit-maximizing rent and vacancy levels to the company's landlord clients. Critics charged that this software effectively created a cartel among landlords, who were told by the company's algorithm to hold rents at above-market rates.\n\nThe legal case against RealPage's software rested on the fact that its algorithm relied on proprietary data from competing landlords to recommend marketwide rent levels.\n\n\"Competing companies must make independent pricing decisions, and with the rise of algorithmic and artificial intelligence tools, we will remain at the forefront of vigorous antitrust enforcement,\" said Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division.\n\nThe settlement agreement, which will still have to be accepted by the court, will limit RealPage's ability to use real-time leasing data to train its models. Its models would not be allowed to consider geographic effects narrower than the state level.\n\n\"RealPage's historical use of aggregated and anonymized nonpublic data, which include rents that are typically lower than advertised rents, has led to lower rents, less vacancies, and more procompetitive effects,\" said Stephen Weissman, a lawyer representing RealPage.\n\nWeissman said that RealPage has already been in the process of implementing changes required by the proposed settlement. As part of the agreement with the DOJ, the company does not concede any wrongdoing.\n\nIn recent years, RealPage has become the latest boogeyman blamed for high housing prices. Private litigants and state attorneys general accused the company in their own lawsuits of driving up vacancy rates and prices by encouraging landlords to hold units off the market.\n\nThe Biden administration first sued the company in August 2024.\n\nAs I've written before, whatever the legal merits of the DOJ case, the economic attack against RealPage never made much sense.\n\nThe limited research on rent-recommendation software has generally found that it leads to more efficient pricing. In down markets, it encourages landlords to cut prices faster. In hot markets, it encourages them to raise prices faster.\n\nWe can see evidence for this argument in rough comparisons between different cities' housing markets. Austin landlords' use of RealPage software hasn't stopped rents from plummeting in response to a glut of new supply. San Francisco's ban on the use of rent-recommendation software hasn't stopped rents in that supply-constrained city from rising.\n\nUpdate: pic.twitter.com/fx6kCW2iKY\n— Max Dubler ????️‍????

Recipients born between the 11th and 20th are paid on the third Wednesday, and those born after the 20th are paid on the fourth Wednesday.For those who received Social Security before May 1997, you can expect your payment on the third day of the month, unless it falls on a weekend or holiday.Those who receive both Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) can expect their Social Security payment on the third day of the month and their SSI payment on the first day of the month.Full 2025 Social Security payment calendarSSI payment schedule for the rest of 2025 and into 2026SSI checks will be sent out on the following dates in 2025 and early 2026, according to the SSA calendar:Monday, Dec. 1, 2025 (Check for December 2025)Wednesday, Dec. 31, 2025 (Check for January 2026)Friday, Jan. 30, 2026 (Check for February 2026)Friday, Feb. 27, 2026 (Check for March 2026)Fernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

Turkey tradition: The history of the presidential turkey pardonThe pardoning tradition officially began at the 1989 presentation with President George H.W. Bush, who declared that the turkey “will not end up on anyone’s dinner table, not this guy – he’s presented a presidential pardon as of right now – and allow him to live out his days on a children’s farm not far from here.”Since then, 60 turkeys have been pardoned and saved from ending up on Thanksgiving dinner tables. The American people also get involved with the tradition, including this year, by choosing the names of the turkeys to be pardoned. Gobble and Waddle’s names were selected via an online poll sent out on social media by the Office of the First Lady.Iowa Couple Reveals How They Finally Escaped Their TimeshareSilverPenny | AdAdUndoSeniors Born 1939-1969 Receive 11 Benefits This Month If They AskSuper Saving Online | AdAdUndoHouseholds With 2+ Vehicles Should Be Doing ThisTired of high premiums?

        "text": "It's still more than a month until Zohran Mamdani becomes mayor, but already he's made some moves in the transition that have some people worried. Last week a mob of activists held a protest outside a synagogue in Manhattan. Mamdani may not be the mayor but people wanted to know how he would react, especially given that this particular mob seemed like his people.\n\nA rowdy protest descended last Wednesday on Park East Synagogue, one of New York’s most prominent Modern Orthodox congregations, which had rented space to an organization that helps Jews move to Israel as well as to settlements in the occupied West Bank. Chants of “death to the I.D.F.” and “globalize the intifada” rang through the air.Mr. Mamdani, the mayor-elect, responded the next day, saying through a spokeswoman that he “discouraged the language” used at the protest and that New Yorkers must be “free to enter a house of worship without intimidation.”But it was what he said next that alarmed some Jewish leaders: He chastised the synagogue, saying through his spokeswoman that “these sacred spaces should not be used to promote activities in violation of international law.”\n\nThis seems to be a tic from his loudmouth activist days. But with only a month to go, it's probably time to lay off the references to international law and start concerning yourself with US and New York law. Mamdani was elected mayor, not president. Someone must have talked to him because yesterday he issued a second statement minus the commentary on international law.\n\n“We will protect New Yorkers’ First Amendment rights while making clear that nothing can justify language calling for ‘death to’ anyone,” Mr. Mamdani said in a statement to The New York Times. “It is unacceptable, full stop.”\n\nIn any case, his first answer left some Jewish leaders less than impressed.\n\nA synagogue is where Jews learn, pray, and strengthen Jewish life. Teaching about aliyah and Zionism belongs in that space. It reflects who we are as a people.Mayor-Elect Mamdani’s claim that Park East “misused” a sacred space by hosting an aliyah program crosses a clear line.… https://t.co/L3I9HbH4Km— William Daroff (@Daroff) November 23, 2025\n\nSince then, Mamdani has spoken by phone with the rabbi of this synagogue, Arthur Schneier, who recommended a law preventing protests outside synagogues. We'll have to wait and see where that goes.\n\nMeanwhile, Mamdani is also gearing up his transition team. He seems to be trying to reassure his DSA buddies that he's still part of the team.\n\nNew York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani announced Monday the creation of 17 transition advisory committees made up of more than 400 people to help advise his incoming administration on policy and appointments, and to help him chart a new course for city government...The Mamdani team will have the expected committees on transportation and public safety, for example, but he will also have two committees that have not been part of other mayoral transitions, including one on worker justice and another on community organizing...\"If you are a card-carrying member of the DSA, you're concerned today that maybe the guy that rose to the mayor's position with your support is turning on you. So it's important that he says to them, I'm still one of you, I got your back,\" [Prof.] Polanco said. \n\nOne of Mamdani's picks for his Community Safety Committee ought to also be raising some concerns with the NYPD.\n\nAlex Vitale, a Brooklyn College sociology professor, was among those tapped on Monday to help staff Mamdani’s committee on community safety amid the mayoral turnover...The liberal professor is behind a 2017 anti-cop book — titled “The End of Policing” — that decries “broken windows” and other proactive policies...Vitale has long argued against the broken-windows policing — claiming the NYPD has disproportionately and unjustifiably targeted minority communities in the past.\n\nVitale goes beyond criticizing broken-windows policing. He sees police as \"class enemies.\"\n\n🚨 Mamdani’s Transition Team Now Includes a Professor Who Calls Police “Class Enemies.”Professor Alex Vitale explained on a DSA call that cops are “the natural enemy of the working class” and that individual officers do not matter because the structure itself neutralizes their… pic.twitter.com/ADMahXmdRE— Stu Smith (@thestustustudio) November 25, 2025\n\nHe's still advocating for and end to policing, which he calls \"violence work.\" He recommends an alternative called \"pod mapping\" which is even dumber than it sounds.\n\n🚨 “Kill the Cop in Our Head”: Mamdani Transition Pick Rejects Reform, Calls Policing “Violence Work,” and Advocates for \"Pod Mapping\"Zohran Mamdani just appointed Professor Alex Vitale to his community safety transition team.Vitale says it plainly, “Policing is about… pic.twitter.com/jvwgh3CUt6— Stu Smith (@thestustustudio) November 25, 2025\n\nIf you want to read all about pod mapping, you can do that here by reading the source document. The basic idea is that instead of police to deal with violence, rape, etc. you'd sketch out a network of friends and trusted individuals to handle those crimes instead. I encourage you to read it because the paper itself really suggests the idea can't possibly work as most people don't have a network large enough to do much of anything. Of course this is all blamed on capitalism which gives you an idea where this whole thing is coming from.\n\nMost people have few solid, dependable relationships in their lives. Much of this is from the breaking of relationships, isolation, fear and criminalization that capitalism requires. We found that for many people, mapping their pod was a sobering process, as many thought their pod would be larger than it actually was.\n\nThe best part of the dumb paper is the fact that the author refers to these social justice collectives as \"pod people\" which seems like a dead accurate way to describe the fringe whackos who are taking this seriously.\n\nHonestly, the idea that this 6-page paper (and one full page is a picture) could replace traditional policing in a city of 8 million is so absurd that any person suggesting it should be mocked and ridiculed in public.\n\nThe fact that Mamdani selected Prof. Vitale to be a leader on the city's community safety commission (along with Louis Farrakhan fan Tamika Mallory) ought to worry all of the people who live in NYC. Your safety is not being taken seriously.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Hot Air's conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

        "text": "The national Republican party is doubling down on its strategy of tying socialist New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani to Democrats in midterm elections following President Donald Trump’s friendly Oval Office meeting with him, The Daily Signal has learned.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee issued a memo shortly before Mamdani’s win detailing the party’s plan to “weaponize” Mamdani against Democrats. But on Friday, Trump came away from his meeting with Mamdani saying he is “very confident” the socialist can do a “very good job” in New York City. \n\nThrough Trump previously threatened to pull federal funding from New York if Mamdani won, he said, “I expect to be helping him, not hurting him.”\n\nHowever, a GOP campaign strategist said Republicans still plan to hold Mamdani’s feet to the fire.\n\n“We’re still going to attack him, especially when he gets into office,” the campaign strategist said. “He has all of these extreme radicals he’s surrounding himself with. He’s going to be incredibly incompetent, so we plan on definitely making Democrats answer for that.”\n\nThe source said Trump looked strong and gracious in the Oval Office meeting, and it was clear Mamdani knows he needs a relationship with Trump. The mayor-elect presented himself as someone that could work with Trump, but the Republican party is ready to “fire away” on Mamdani when he begins his term and starts being “incompetent” and a “radical extremist.”\n\n“Trump can be gracious to many people, but going forward, the minute that he tries to implement communist policies, Republicans on all sides are going to make sure that we hold him accountable for that,” the strategist said, “and we hold all Democrats accountable for that.”\n\nTrump’s change of tune with Mamdani will spark “no changes” to the GOP’s midterm strategy, another national Republican strategist told The Daily Signal.\n\nTrump kicked off a smart strategy of starting his relationship with Mamdani with a bipartisan push to make New York safer and more affordable. Mamdani recognized that the president loves New York and would like to be friends with the new mayor and charmed him, the strategist said.\n\nBut it won’t take long for the country to see how ineffective and dangerous Mamdani’s policies are, and the GOP will be quick to push back on socialism and tie Mamdani to other Democrat candidates. \n\nRep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who is challenging Democrat New York Gov. Kathy Hochul in midterms, has pressed hard on her opponent’s connection to socialist Mamdani. \n\nA reporter asked Trump if he agreed with Stefanik’s claim that Mamdani is a jihadist.\n\n“No I don’t,” Trump responded. “You say things sometimes in a campaign,” Trump said of Stefanik. “She’s a very capable person.”\n\nStefanik doesn’t think Mamdani and Trump’s love fest complicates her messaging, she said in a a local news interview. \n\n“I strongly believe that Zohran Mamdani is catastrophic for the people of New York City and really for the people of New York State, particularly when you consider the fact that New York City and the greater New York City region is home to more Jewish families than any other part of the world outside of Israel,” she said.\n\n“You have Zohran Mamdani, who is a defund-the-police, tax-hiking socialist who has campaigned with an unindicted co-conspirator of terrorist attacks, including the 1993 World Trade Center bombing that killed New Yorkers,” she continued. “So, I stand by my statement: He is a jihadist, and this is an area where President Trump and I disagree.”",

Working with Phil felt seamless—our instincts were so similar, and we always seemed to be in sync.”\n\nLater in the piece, she wrote, “I had been expecting him to die since the day he started using again, but when it finally happened it hit me with brutal force.”\n\nReports swirled of a separation in the final months of Hoffman’s life, who is survived by O’Donnell and their children, Cooper, now 22, Tallulah, 18, and Willa, 16. \n\nC.K., meanwhile, has had a very different trial of his own, admitting to multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against women in 2017. \n\nThe father of two became the center of a New York Times article detailing the allegations of five women against him. \n\nHaving previously rebuked rumors in the past, he admitted to claims he had exposed himself after inviting women for a nightcap. \n\n“These stories are true,” C.K., real name Louis Szekely, said the morning after the story broke. \n\nHis admission and subsequent exile from the public eye proved fatal for his movie, I Love You, Daddy, which was ultimately aborted. \n\nDuring the saga, C.K.’s former colleague Tig Notaro told the Daily Beast in an interview in 2017 they’d had “an incident,” adding, “We don’t talk since then.”\n\nA year prior, fellow comedian Roseanne Barr told the Daily Beast she had heard stories about the comedian’s inappropriate behaviour for years. “It’s Louis C.K., locking the door and masturbating in front of women comics and writers. I can’t tell you—I’ve heard so many stories. Not just him, but a lot of them. And it’s just par for the course. It’s just s--t women have to put up with.”\n\nIn a follow-up email, she added, “These allegations [against Louis C.K.] have been leveled and talked about for years. I do not have first-hand knowledge, though I have heard women make these allegations.”\n\nC.K., who was married to Alix Bailey until 2005, has been slowly reconstructing his career since 2019, to mixed reactions from the stand-up circuit. \n\nHe has a show Tuesday at New York’s Beacon Theater, which is sold out, as is another show on Wednesday, November 26. So too are his next seven shows in San Diego, Los Angeles, Long Beach, and San Francisco. \n\nIn October, he made his public return to TV in an appearance on Bill Maher’s show Real Time with Bill Maher, eight years after the allegations. \n\nIt comes off the back of him performing at the controversial Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia for government officials. Also in the lineup for the festival were the likes of Dave Chappelle, Bill Burr, and Kevin Hart. \n\n“I mean, how do you even promote that?” Marc Maron said, admonishing those deciding to perform. “‘From the folks that brought you 9/11. Two weeks of laughter in the desert, don’t miss it!’ \n\n“I mean, the same guy that’s gonna pay them is the same guy that paid that guy to bone-saw Jamal Khashoggi and put him in a f--king suitcase. But don’t let that stop the yucks, it’s gonna be a good time!”\n\nO’Donnell made headlines of her own in the fall, standing up as an early advocate of New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. \n\nSpeaking to the New York Post ahead of his successful election campaign, she said, “I love a progressive candidate. He’s got the energy. I love free child care, free buses.”",

        "text": "If anyone needed proof of how swiftly political change can arrive, this fall is probably Example A.\n\nJust observe the last month. First, California Gov. Gavin Newsom was riding high after passage of Proposition 50 and its changes in California congressional district lines made him the most successful national Democrat in countering a key initiative by President Trump.\n\nBarely a week later, Newsom’s former chief of staff was indicted on charges of political corruption and tax fraud and many began to write him off as a presidential candidate because of it.\n\nNot even a week after that, Newsom was back in the catbird seat after a federal appeals court in Texas threw out that state’s gerrymandered congressional district plan – which earlier provided the motive for the Newsom-sponsored Prop. 50. The U.S. Supreme Court days later temporarily reinstated the gerrymandered Texas lines.\n\nIt now appears the Texas decision nixing the changes there may be reversed by the high court, even though it was written by a Trump-appointed judge. Meanwhile the California proposition figures to survive its own court challenges, filed by the state Republican Party and the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nThat’s because Texas officials from Gov. Greg Abbott down were open about their effort to concentrate Houston-area blacks into one district while giving five others to white Republicans. By contrast, there was little or no mention of race by either side in the Prop. 50 campaign, which was very explicitly motivated by pure politics.\n\nNewsom created Prop. 50 specifically to counter the Texas gerrymander, which unlike California’s changes in district lines, was not adopted by a vote of the people. No race issue ever arose here until Republicans claimed after Prop. 50’s resounding win that was what motivated it.\n\nNothing says the U.S. Supreme Court has to give a final OK to either the Texas court decision or Prop. 50, but if it eventually tosses both gerrymanders, Newsom would still achieve his political goal of offsetting the Texas changes put in motion by a phone call from Trump to Abbott. If both efforts are eventually nixed, Newsom’s goal of regaining the prior balance after the Texas action would still have been reached.\n\nSaid one election law professor the day of the Texas decision, “There are not many grounds for a legal challenge against Prop. 50 to succeed.”\n\nThere remains a possibility that both Prop. 50 and the Texas court decision tossing that state’s gerrymander will stand up in the Supreme Court. If that happens, Newsom would have achieved far more than his goal of balancing the Texas gerrymander with an exchange of five new California Democratic seats for five new Texas GOP ones. In that case, Newsom would have given Democrats a net gain of five seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nIf something like that couldn’t put Newsom in an early lead in the 2028 Democratic presidential sweepstakes, it’s hard to see what could. A net gain of five seats would likely give Democrats control of the House, where almost all new Trump initiatives might then die.\n\nNo wonder Newsom gloating after the Texas court decision came down. In a post on X, he said, “Donald Trump and Greg Abbott played with fire, got burned, and democracy won.” For a moment.\n\nFor Newsom took a turn toward the center in his bill signings this fall, favoring business in many of his decisions.\n\nHis fall efforts were clearly designed to stamp him as a moderate, but also an environmentalist with a tight financial fist.\n\nThis could leave him open to a challenge from the left by someone like New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has built a career around leading her party’s far-left wing.\n\nThat possibility gained credence from the New York mayoral win of Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani and the subsequent upset win by fellow Democratic Socialist Katie Wilson and a slate of similarly-oriented candidates in Seattle.\n\nThe bottom line: Newsom may be riding high today, but in a season of very speedy change, no one can know how long that will last.\n\nEmail Thomas Elias at tdelias@aol.com.",

        "text": "Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said this week that she has no interest in a friendly meet-up with President Donald Trump, unlike New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. \n\nMamdani, the young Democratic Socialist who shocked the political world this year, dominated headlines on Friday after meeting with Trump in the White House. Despite the fact that Mamdani railed against Trump on the campaign trail, the president showed surprising warmness toward Mamdani in a joint press conference in the Oval Office after their meeting.\n\nWu was asked if she would be open to a similar type of meeting with Trump during a turkey distribution event in Jamaica Plain Monday. She offered a blunt response. \n\n“I’m not interested in a bromance with the federal regime,” Wu said, per The Boston Globe. \n\nWu’s disdain for the Trump administration is nothing new. In the spring, Wu’s strong performance during a hearing in front of many Trump-friendly GOP lawmakers in Washington amplified her national profile. Federal officials continued to antagonize her over the city’s immigration enforcement policies throughout the year, allowing Wu to take a defiant stance that played well in a city that largely dislikes the president. \n\nShe cruised through a reelection campaign and secured a second term, during which there will undoubtedly be plenty more opportunities for resistance. The Wu administration is amid a continuous effort to obtain information about ICE activity, and is facing a lawsuit from the Trump administration challenging the legality of a local law that limits how Boston police can assist ICE. State Attorney General Andrea Campbell got involved in that case this week. ICE has ramped up enforcement activities in Boston this year, most recently drawing ire from Wu and residents over the raid of a car wash in Allston. \n\nMamdani and Wu are both young progressives tasked with leading major cities in an era when the Democratic Party is looking for new leaders. After her big 2025, Wu is increasingly being held up as a model for Democratic governance nationwide. Mamdani is on record as being a big fan of Wu, calling her the most effective Democrat in the country during a debate earlier this year. She offered praise after Mamdani’s electoral victories this year, and the two have had brief phone conversations. \n\nMamdani’s campaign was based heavily on a few core progressive policies, and he will have to show voters that he is aggressively working toward them once he takes office in January. New York City could have a larger target on its back than Boston, and a protracted fight with the Trump administration would derail Mamdani’s momentum and potentially cause fissures in his support. \n\nDuring their surprisingly cordial meeting, Mamdani and Trump largely sidestepped talk about immigration and other hot-button issues. Antagonism between the two could ramp up again at any moment, but for now Mamdani is enjoying general praise for seemingly delaying actions like Trump sending the National Guard to New York City. \n\nWu has a different calculus in mind. \n\n“From my point of view, flattery is not the way,” she said, according to the Globe. “I think Boston residents want to stand strong on our values and to get things done and to keep moving forward, and that’s what we’re going to continue to do.”\n\nWu did not directly attack Mamdani, and was clear that every leader and community must make their own decisions in deciding how to navigate a tense political moment. \n\nWu is open to meeting the president, but only if his administration makes major changes, she said. \n\n“If it came with a promise to stop snatching residents illegally off the streets, stop prosecuting his political enemies, stop cutting life-saving research and funding?” she said. “Sure, I would be open to a conversation at that point.”",

        "text": "New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has appointed a university professor who has described police officers as “violence workers” to serve on his community safety committee.\n\nMamdani announced Monday that Alex Vitale, a sociology professor at Brooklyn College, will advise his incoming administration on community safety matters. Vitale has a long history of disparaging police, calling them the “natural enemy” of the working class, and advocating for defunding law enforcement.\n\nThe appointment casts fresh doubt on the mayor-elect‘s attempt to distance himself from his own past remarks calling for the defunding of the New York Police Department (NYPD), which he labeled a “racist, anti-queer and a major threat to public safety.” (RELATED: Blue City ‘Violence Prevention’ Activists Keep Catching Violent Charges)\n\nVitale referred to individual officers as “class enemies” during a 2020 interview with the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) when asked where police fit into the “class struggle.”\n\nHis 2017 book, “The End of Policing,” argues that the “problem is not police training, police diversity, or police methods. The problem is policing itself.”\n\n“The whole point is they’re violence workers. You can’t train them not to be violence workers,” Vitale said during a separate 2020 interview in which he argued that police cannot be reformed.\n\nLike Mamdani, Vitale has stated that the “institution of policing exists historically to facilitate racial inequality… emerging out of colonialism, slavery, and industrial capitalism.”\n\nThe professor also advocates decriminalizing so-called “sex work” or prostitution and produced a 2025 film titled “Sex Work: It’s Just a Job.”\n\nVitale is one of roughly 400 advisors who will serve across 17 committees ahead of Mamdani’s January inauguration.\n\n“A love for hard work, a deep belief in the promise of New York City, and a commitment to the affordability agenda that New Yorkers are demanding unite the more than 400 experts we have appointed to our Transition Committees today,” Mamdani said on Monday. “By helping us recruit top talent and develop smart policy, these committees will be instrumental to ensuring we hit the ground running on January 1st — and that our results align with the promises we’ve made.”\n\nMamdani has insisted in recent months that he no longer supports defunding the NYPD. He also apologized to officers during an October Fox News interview for past disparaging comments, saying he is committed to “representing the men and women of the NYPD.”\n\n“I apologize because of the fact that I’m looking to work with these officers, and I know that these officers, these men and women who serve in the NYPD, they put their lives on the line every single day,” Mamdani said.\n\nVitale’s views, however, are consistent with positions held by the DSA, of which Mamdani is a member. The group calls on the country to “end the criminalization of working-class survival,” “invest in community self-governance and care, not cops” and provide “freedom for all incarcerated people.”\n\n“For all of the working class to achieve collective liberation, we must constrain, diminish, and abolish the carceral forces of the state — from prisons and police themselves, to their manifestations in all forms throughout society,” the DSA’s website says.\n\nAs recently as December 2024, Mamdani called for cuts to funding for the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group, the unit that responded to the killing of Officer Didarul Islam.\n\nMeanwhile, NYPD data shows that misdemeanors, “major” felonies and non-major felonies in New York City have been more frequent every year since 2020.\n\nNeither Mamdani nor Vitale responded to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

        "text": "School daze\n\n“Schools of Hope” in Florida has now been given the right to feed at the taxpayer trough. The plan to fill empty seats in district schools at no cost is akin to moving into your neighbor’s home rent-free, as the spare bedroom is available.\n\nThis is another step in the shortsighted play to bust unions, selectively shift curriculum and classroom/library resources, hold down pay and benefits and now, give away student seats. This is the old Jeb Bush effort toward defunding school districts and privatizing Florida public education.\n\nFlori-Duh is on display with the dismantling of public school districts in favor of the profitable business of education. The free lunch is alive and well for charter school power brokers.\n\nGeorge Ellis,\n\nLocal hysteria\n\nRe: Mary Anna Mancuso’s Nov. 16 op-ed, “Miami GOP is right to sound the alarm on Mamdani.” I am always intrigued by how quickly Miami’s Cuban community calls “communism” on anyone with progressive politics.\n\nCuba has never had sustained democratic rule. Post independence, it staggered from one corrupt administration to another, interspersed with various U.S. interventions:\n\n1898-1902, United States military rule;\n\n1906-1909, United States Marine occupation;\n\n1912, to suppress Afro-Cuban demonstrations in eastern Cuba;\n\n1917-1922, Marines deployed to “protect” U.S. interests in the Sugar Intervention.\n\nFulgencio Batista, facing electoral loss in 1952, staged a coup, suspended the Constitution of 1940 and ushered in a de facto military dictatorship marked by suppression of free speech, disappearance of political opponents and corruption aligned with American organized crime. His right-wing dictatorial regime set the table for the left-wing dictatorial Castro regime that followed.\n\nYet, faced with an American president who refused to accept an electoral loss, tried to overthrow the 2020 election by asking the Georgia Secretary of State to find “11,780 votes” and whose supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, there is zero sense of dread among Miami Cubans, who should be well aware that a right-wing dictatorship is no better than a left-wing dictatorship.\n\nThe prospect of encroaching authoritarianism must alarm us, even if so-called conservative Republicans embrace it. Miamians have nothing to fear from the mayor-elect of New York and his policies. It is “red-scare” politics to suggest otherwise.\n\nLorraine Dowdy,\n\nGet onboard\n\nWhy do the Miami Herald and WLRN radio have such a vendetta against Brightline?\n\nThe Nov. 16 front page story, “Private train, public cash: How Brightline has been buoyed by Florida taxpayer dollars,” featured three pages bemoaning public investment – and the very unfortunate, but also very avoidable, deaths.\n\nEveryone I know who has ridden the train has positive comments. It’s faster and safer than driving, quite comfortable and you’re able to get work done while traveling. Anyone would be in favor of removing some of the unbelievable traffic on our overcrowded highways.\n\nAs for public investment, I have no problem with my tax dollars doing good for the local region. I could easily provide three pages of things I don’t want my tax dollars doing.\n\nJohn Saviano,\n\nMiami Beach\n\nLocal history\n\nThe Nov. 16 In Depth cover story, “Change of venue,” on the new Miami-Dade County civil courthouse, was comprehensive and terrific. While the focus was on the naming of same for the late Osvaldo Soto, there was no mention of the parallel and unsuccessful effort to dedicate the courthouse to the late and longtime Clerk of County Courts Harvey Ruvin.\n\nHarvey, a good friend who served in public office for more than 30 years, was universally respected; his funeral was held at Dade County Auditorium, after all. The groundswell of support to name the new courthouse for Harvey lost out to the efforts of those supporting Soto. It’s a done deal.\n\nThe North Dade Justice Center and the street fronting the downtown courthouse will honor Harvey and bring some measure of relief to the community. Both men brought honor to their respective communities; both men’s memories are blessings.\n\nMichael D. Orovitz,\n\nBay Harbor Islands\n\nTrash tragedy\n\nOur Miami-Dade County commissioners are fixated on building a new incinerator to replace one that burned down in 2023. However, they can’t decide which neighborhood wants the garbage burning in their backyard.\n\nIf you live in a municipality that is willing to sacrifice people’s health and property values, please let your commissioners know. If not, then maybe you should ask them why aren’t we implementing a zero waste strategy that eliminates the need for incineration and saves the $1.5 billion cost to build one. It’s time for innovation, not incineration.\n\nNoel Cleland,\n\n‘People’s plight’\n\nRe: Mary Anna Mancuso’s Nov. 16 op-ed, “Miami GOP is right to sound the alarm on Mamdani.” Like U.S. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, I was born in Cuba and experienced the Castro takeover.\n\nMancuso however, didn’t address the real issue — the failure of President Trump and the GOP to help the poorest and most vulnerable in our community. The GOP has done nothing to address the huge income inequality and rising affordability crisis. It has done everything to deny working class Americans health care, a basic human right.\n\nThe wages of gardeners, teachers and trash collectors, among others, are insufficient to provide families adequate shelter, food and medical care. Republicans’ answer is to provide huge tax breaks to corporations and wealthy Americans and throw lavish Halloween parties while denying poor Americans SNAP benefits during the government shutdown.\n\nZohran Mamdani was elected mayor of New York City because he addressed the people’s plight. Americans will turn to leaders who recognize and address their concerns and offer solutions that allow them to provide for their families’ freedom, food, shelter and health care. Unless we do this, we will end like the Roman and British empires.\n\nSergio Fernandez,\n\nCoral Gables\n\nScary thought\n\nI’m a lifelong Democrat. When U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican, appears on national television and makes more sense than all the leaders of the Democratic Party, it is truly frightening.\n\nEric P. Littman,\n\nInspiring name\n\nI was saddened to read about the death of Seth Gordon. I was director of development for New World School of the Arts (NWSA) for five years when Seth was its chairman. He was a creative force and fun to be around. It’s one thing to have creative ideas, but it takes real leadership to bring them to fruition.\n\nSeth wanted to create a version of New York City’s “Fame School” in Miami. He successfully shepherded his idea through the Florida Legislature, creating the NWSA. If the NWSA board named the lobby or a significant performance space in his honor, it would be a fitting tribute.\n\nDoug Mayer,\n\nCoral Gables\n\nRapport building\n\nOne of the great lines in the iconic film, “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, is “Who are those guys?” That line resonates in my mind often. As a good woke liberal (redundant, I know), I find that in most meetings I attend, the implicit and sometimes explicit suggestion is that they are open to getting to know the other side. That is not the case.\n\nI call on bookstores, liberal churches and other venues that have hosted programs promoting my political bent to bring in the “other side” to voice their worldview. Finding out “who are those guys” does not mean you are endorsing their views; it does mean you are making an honest effort to find out.\n\nSid Kaskey,\n\nSouth Miami\n\nFloating library\n\nThe Presidential Library, which will be built on Biscayne Boulevard, will be a fitting tribute to Donald Trump and his presidency.\n\nOf course, it will have to be built on stilts, because after a hundred years of rising sea levels, the Atlantic Ocean will be lapping at its foundation and, in the distance, Miami Beach will be just a memory.\n\nJames Gross,\n\nNational Hurricane Center meteorologist,\n\nSouth Miami",

        "text": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday that New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is the leader of the Democratic Party during an interview on Tuesday. Speaking to CNBC host Andrew Ross Sorkin, Bessent said, \"I was in the room, and I think that you’ve got to have some admiration for a candidate who ran a campaign the way he did. It was a great, great campaign.\" \"He is clearly the leader of the Democratic Party now. And I think it speaks to how open-minded the president is, that he invited him into the Oval,\" Bessent said. The treasury secretary pointed out that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., did not endorse Mamdani in the mayoral race. Other key New York Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Gov. Kathy Hochul, did endorse the mayor-elect. DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST CALLS MAMDANI'S TRUMP MEETING 'WEAK' AFTER TOUGH CAMPAIGN TALK \"President Trump wants the best for New Yorkers,\" Bessent added. \"I can tell you, my impression of the mayor-elect is he’s a young man with a lot of old ideas that have never worked. Point to one example where policies like his have led to anything other than a decline.\" He also said it was easy to run a campaign, but actually governing — \"keeping people safe, picking up the trash, making the subways run on time\" — was a whole other challenge. \"We'll see,\" Bessent added. SCOTT BESSENT CONFRONTS GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS FOR LABELING GOP 'TERRORISTS' DURING 1995 GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN Sorkin also asked Democratic strategist James Carville about who he saw as the leader of the party, noting Bessent's argument that it was Mamdani. \"No one represents the party. The only person that can represent the party is a presidential nominee, who will be chosen by the party members who vote in the primaries,\" Carville argued. Trump said Mamdani was a \"rational person\" during a press conference after their meeting on Friday.

He really ran an incredible race against, you know, a lot of smart people, starting with the early primaries against some very tough people, very smart people. And he beat them, and he beat them easily. And I congratulated him, and we talked about some things in very strong common, like housing and getting housing built and food and prices.\"",

        "text": "New York’s infamous ‘Hole’ neighborhood in East New York is slated for resiliency upgrades, a rezoning, and more housing.\n\nWhen you walk south down Ruby Street, from Conduit Boulevard to Linden Boulevard in the easternmost bit of Brooklyn, you descend 10 feet.\n\nThat 12-block depression that straddles the Brooklyn-Queens border has been infamously dubbed “The Hole” because it sits below the other land around it—and it’s not connected to the city’s sewer system.\n\nEvery time it rains, the streets flood. And so do the homes of the neighborhood residents.\n\n“I get three feet of water in my basement,” said Jimmy, a north Jewel Streets resident who preferred to go only by his first name.\n\nAfter decades of neglect, local community groups are optimistic about a city plan to transform the neighborhood.\n\nThe $146 million project will build sewers, add a chain of ponds for rainwater to flow to Jamaica Bay, and unlock the development of as many as 5,000 units of housing.\n\nThe proposal finally has momentum after community groups pushed the city’s Department of Environmental Protection, Housing Preservation and Development, and local councilmembers to take action.\n\n“For far too long, this community has gone without basic infrastructure, fending for themselves in the face of constant flooding, faulty septic systems, and rampant illegal dumping. Today, we move towards a more livable, resilient future for the neighborhood,” said Meredith McNair, senior community planner with the Cypress Hills Local Development Corporation when the plan was announced.\n\nFrom ‘The Hole’ to the Jewel Streets\n\nWhen you walk through The Hole, you hear the splash of tires splitting puddles of water, trucks rumbling by—even goats bleating.\n\nBut in between those moments of chaos, there’s peace.\n\n“It’s like the country down here,” said Jimmy.\n\nThe streets, once asphalt, are a dusty mix of storm runoff and dirt on a good day. After a rain, the roads are completely inundated with floodwater.\n\nFor decades, it’s been a free-for-all in The Hole. Illegal industrial businesses operate on some of the vacant lots, sending loud trucks down streets that are intended just for residential use.\n\n“Do you know how long I’ve been complaining about this? I don’t make any noise,” said Jimmy. He’s lived in the Jewel streets all his life, and said he’s seen the gamut of businesses and hustlers making use of the vacant lots.\n\n“There was a bus company, yellow bus company, five o’clock in the morning, you would hear backup alarms,” he said. Another adjoining property, he says, “ended up becoming a parking lot for the airport. All hours of the night, there were people here beeping.”\n\nFor decades, the Department of Environmental Protection had funding for sewer construction in The Hole. But the city hadn’t been able to push the project forward.\n\nIn 2022, residents sent a letter to the Adams administration demanding change, kicking off two years of community engagement.\n\n“We were pissed off. Angry. Just because we were left so many years unheard. We felt like the retaining wall at the dead end street, just trapped, like we didn’t exist,” said Julisa Rodriguez, who lives at the south end of Sapphire street with her children.\n\nThe East New York Community Land Trust and the Cypress Hills Development Corporation led the organizing effort, knocking on doors, convening residents, and negotiating with the city. They asserted their desire for a true neighborhood.\n\nHannah Anousheh, director of the East New York CLT, called it a “masterclass” in working with—but also pushing—the city.\n\n“We have to give them credit… but at the same time they have to constantly be pushed and constantly be told they have to listen to residents,” said Anousheh.\n\nSince then, things have improved modestly. The city added catch basins in the ground to absorb some of the flooding—but it still takes the streets a day or two to drain.\n\nThe city also started cracking down on businesses operating illegally on the streets that were causing disturbances.\n\nAfter two years, the plan that emerged was not for The Hole but reimagined as the Jewel Streets—named after Sapphire, Amber, Emerald, and Ruby streets that run North to South through the neighborhood.\n\n‘Blue belts’ and buyouts\n\nTo fix the Jewel Streets, planners are fighting nature itself.\n\n“Our sewer system runs on gravity,” said Michael Sandler, associate commissioner for neighborhood strategies at HPD.\n\nThe Hole follows the path of what was once Spring Creek—which has since been paved over. But water still yearns to run through the historic channel. When it can’t flow, it sits below sea level in The Hole.\n\nWith more frequent, more severe storms from a changing climate, the flooding is getting worse.\n\nNot being part of the sewer system also presents unique challenges, Sandler added. “When they flush their toilet, it just drains into the yard next to their house, and that dirt has standing water, so septic stuff flows back out into the neighborhood because of the grade.”\n\nA plan to manage stormwater will create two ponds on the north side of Linden Boulevard that will collect rain. Then the water will flow under Linden, and get pumped up to Spring Creek, which empties into Jamaica Bay.\n\nWith water runoff managed in a “blue-belt” that will recreate and uncover the path of the historic Spring Creek, the city can then raise the below-grade streets, unlocking the potential for new development.\n\n“Resiliency and quality of life investments for the residents of the Jewel Streets, will allow thousands of new homes, including a very significant amount of affordable housing,” said Sandler.\n\nThat will leave many of the neighborhood’s existing homes several feet below the new street—requiring adaptation lest they continue to be at significant flooding risk.\n\nIn the Jewel Streets, the city is testing its first ever pre-disaster buyout program. Usually, the government only offers buyouts after a disaster happens—like it did after Hurricane Sandy. \n\nBut knowing that the neighborhood will flood again, officials are seeking to be proactive, offering Jewel Streets homeowners the option of having the city purchase their land. \n\nA new neighborhood\n\nWhen all of that’s built—which could take years, planners say—the Jewel Streets will finally have the ingredients of a new neighborhood.\n\nThe city wants to rezone more than 20 blocks to facilitate the development of new housing, activate commercial strips, and bring more amenities to the community.\n\nThe area is a 15 minute walk from two subway stations at Grant Avenue on the North side of Conduit Boulevard and Euclid Avenue in East New York.\n\nPlanners also want to add passenger islands for the B55 bus route, and more pedestrian crossings on busy Linden Boulevard.\n\nA 17 acre city site on the south side of the street will continue the blue belt, with more ponds connecting to Jamaica Bay. The rest of the land will support up to 1,400 new homes.\n\nFacilitating that development will require navigating the city’s often-contested land use process, where residents will continue to weigh in, as well as local councilmembers.\n\nThe area straddles both Brooklyn and Queens, represented by Brooklyn Councilmember Chris Banks and Queens Councilmember Joann Ariola. \n\n“I think the plan is a good plan as it is now,” said Banks, who is cautiously optimistic about the rezoning. \n\nAriola declined to comment on this story.\n\nThe rezoning process wouldn’t kick off until 2026, when Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani will be in office. Mamdani did not respond to a request for comment on the proposal.\n\n“We just need to make sure that the next administration has continuity and a commitment to deliver those funds so that we can get this over the finish line,” said Banks.\n\nAfter years of broken promises, residents of the Jewel Streets are allowing themselves to hope, just a little bit.\n\n“We’re heading in the right direction. There’s still a lot of unknowns, still a lot of questions,” said Rodriguez.\n\nSome organizers are calling to put some of the land into a community land trust that would be resident-controlled condominiums, with an option for existing residents to move into new, permanently affordable homes.\n\nRodriguez told City Limits that, if she gets a fair price, she plans to take the city’s buyout offer and look for another home—though she worries she may not be able to afford New York City prices.\n\nShe said the buyout would be the best thing for her family and her children.\n\n“I envision the plan finally being implemented, although for me, I would prefer to relocate,” said Rodriguez. \n\n“I can’t hide my sentiments of seeing a beautiful Jewel neighborhood, a place of equality and diversity, beautiful homes, sidewalks, trees, colorful flowers, gardens, the smell of fresh grass rather than sewage, children playing in a dry, paved street and making new friends. A tight knit community with all the essentials that others take for granted.”\n\nTo reach the reporter behind this story, contact [email protected].

        "text": "The far-left push within the Democratic Party, highlighted by mayoral victories by socialist candidates in New York City and Seattle, is poised to be a major factor in several key battleground House races as several candidates carrying the progressive mantle hold strong positions in Democratic primaries. Several of the most competitive House races in the country feature candidates putting to the test whether progressive policies can appeal to voters outside deep blue urban centers, including in California’s 22nd Congressional District, where Democrat Randy Villegas is running to unseat Republican Rep. David Valadao. \"Bernie and I share the same goal: to make life more affordable for working families,\" Villegas said in a statement after being endorsed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a self-described \"democratic socialist.\" \"He has dedicated his life to putting power in the hands of ordinary Americans instead of the ultra-rich, and I’m excited to work together to fight for our communities here in the Central Valley and across the country.\" In addition to being endorsed by Sanders, who endorsed New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, Villegas has employed the Fight Agency advertising firm, among others, which is led by operatives who also helped Mamdani cruise to victory earlier this month. SOCIALIST WAVE SPREADS COAST-TO-COAST AS PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS RALLY AROUND ZOHRAN MAMDANI'S NYC WIN Fox News Digital reported this week that Fight Agency is also working to defeat two vulnerable House Republicans in Pennsylvania, Reps. Rob Bresnahan and Ryan Mackenzie. Villegas, endorsed by the progressive Working Families Party that endorsed Mamdani, is currently running in a Democratic primary against California state Assemblywoman Jasmeet Bains, who was recruited by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and currently is sitting on less cash on hand than Villegas. \"Here in the Central Valley, we couldn't care less about political labels,\" Villegas said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"We care about being able to see a doctor without going bankrupt and being able to feed our families without needing a second job. We're sick of politicians in both parties selling us out to billionaires and corporations. Any politician who isn't fighting for working families like our lives depends on it needs to get out of the way.\" In Colorado’s 8th Congressional District, GOP Rep. Gabe Evans is being challenged by another progressive Democrat, Manny Rutinel, in what is expected to be one of the tightest House races next November. Rutinel, who serves as a Colorado state representative, who was reportedly spotted alongside Mamdani and holds a large fundraising lead over his Democrat opponents, has associated himself with a variety of far-left groups and politicians, including Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Townhall reported. Rutinel has been endorsed by progressive groups like CHC Bold PAC and Latino Victory Fund. The race to unseat GOP Rep. Darrell Issa in California’s redrawn 48th Congressional District features Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar, who describes himself as a \"working-class progressive\" and was endorsed by the Sanders-linked group Our Revolution. Campa-Najjar, who volunteered for Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign and appears to be the front-runner in the Democratic primary, was endorsed in 2020 by the Working Families Party as well as Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Courage to Change PAC. CHARLIE KIRK'S WARNINGS ABOUT SOCIALISM RESURFACE AS MAMDANI, TRUMP FOCUS ON AFFORDABILITY GOP Rep. Tom Barrett is up for re-election in Michigan’s 7th Congressional District, and one of the Democrats running to replace him is William Lawrence, who co-founded the progressive Sunrise Movement. Lawrence’s policies have drawn comparisons to Mamdani, including from the Lansing City Pulse, who wrote that his \"campaign is built on a community movement, a message of ‘real representation’ that takes ‘political control away from the establishment and puts it back in the hands of the people.’ It’s like how Zohran Mamdani won in New York City.\" Peter Chatzky is running as a Democrat challenging GOP Rep. Mike Lawler in New York’s 17th Congressional District, and although he is running in a crowded primary, he has the ability to self-fund and is viewed as a formidable contender in a district ranked by Cook Political Report as \"Lean Republican.\" Chatzky has defended Mamdani’s agenda on social media and praised the young socialist for running \"an effective campaign that consistently focused on affordability, fairness, and opportunity in New York City.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Chatzky, the only Democrat in the field who has called for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to step down, has expressed support for \"universal healthcare.\" Like Mamdani, Chatzky has also faced criticism for his positions on Israel and defended Mamdani against allegations of antisemitism. In Nebraska, John Cavanaugh, a state senator, is running as a Democrat to replace retiring GOP Rep. Don Bacon in the 2nd Congressional District with the endorsement of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which he said he is \"grateful\" for and that he plans to join them on the \"front lines.\" As Democratic leadership in Washington, D.C. begins to face calls for new faces, Republicans across the country have made the argument that the socialist push in recent months is reshaping key House races and changing the landscape of the way the Democratic Party operates going forward. Mike Marinella, national spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), told Fox News Digital the rise of progressive candidates is a \"full-blown battle for the soul of the Democrat Party\" and concluded that the \"socialist stampede is winning.\" \"Democrats aren’t focused on helping working families, they’re too busy tearing each other apart.\" In a statement to Fox News Digital, DCCC spokesperson Viet Shelton touted the Democrats across the country who are focusing on affordability. \"Because of House Republicans, everything is too damn expensive and working families are struggling. Republican operatives in D.C. know they can’t win on the issues, so we’re seeing them melt down in real time,\" Shelton said. \"Even President Trump is in the Oval Office desperately bear hugging the Mayor-elect. It’s embarrassing. While they waste their time, Democrats across the country are laser focused on lowering prices and fighting for everyday Americans, which is why we will re-take the majority.\"",

Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., said she disagreed with President Donald Trump on Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and doubled down on calling him a \"jihadist\" during an interview on Monday. News 12 senior political reporter Tara Rosenblum asked Stefanik to respond to Trump disagreeing with her characterization of Mamdani. \"I strongly believe that Zohran Mamdani is catastrophic for the people of New York City and really for the people of New York State, particularly when you consider the fact that New York City and the greater New York City region is home to more Jewish families than any other part of the world outside of Israel. And yet it is increasingly dangerous. We’ve seen a skyrocketing of antisemitism,\" Stefanik said. \"And you have Zohran Mamdani, who is a defund-the-police, tax-hiking socialist who has campaigned with an unindicted co-conspirator of terrorist attacks, including the 1993 World Trade Center bombing that killed New Yorkers. So I stand by my statement, he is a jihadist, and this is an area where President Trump and I disagree,\" the lawmaker added. STEFANIK WRITING NEW BOOK AMID GUBERNATORIAL RUN BUZZ Stefanik entered New York's gubernatorial contest earlier this month in a challenge to unseat incumbent New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul. The president met with Mamdani on Friday and was asked by a reporter during the press conference that followed the meeting if he thought he was standing next to a jihadist, after noting Stefanik's characterization. \"No, I don’t. But she’s out there campaigning, and you know, you say things sometimes in a campaign. She’s a very capable person. But, you’d really have to ask her about that,\" Trump responded, according to The Hill. \"I met with a man who is a very rational person. I met with a man who really wants to see New York be great again.\" Trump told the media on Friday that the two found areas of agreement. MAMDANI SAYS HE WILL MEET JAMIE DIMON, OTHER FINANCIAL TITANS IN NYC \"We have one thing in common,\" Trump said of Mamdani on Friday. \"We want this city of ours that we love to do very well. And I wanted to congratulate the mayor. He really ran an incredible race against, you know, a lot of smart people, starting with the early primaries against some very tough people, very smart people. And he beat them, and he beat them easily. And I congratulated him, and we talked about some things in very strong common, like housing and getting housing built and food and prices.\" Mamdani told NBC's Kristen Welker on Sunday that he still believes Trump is a \"fascist.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Mamdani's campaign and the White House did not immediately return requests for comment.",

Either Zohran charmed Trump into embracing democratic socialism and undercutting every scare tactic the right has weaponized against him for the past six months, or the molly Trump took right before the meeting kicked in.”\n\n[See NewsBusters for more]",

        "text": "When Elon Musk called the New York Times “government-funded media” in February after his Department of Government Efficiency identified government media subscriptions, the storied outlet didn’t take the criticism lying down.\n\nThe Times responded on X with a bulleted statement explaining the nature of those subscriptions. After Donald Trump attacked the paper in April for a line in a story that noted how legal experts have called his CBS lawsuit “baseless,” saying the Times should be held liable for its “likely unlawful behavior,” the paper said his comments were the latest in “a long list of legal threats aimed at discouraging or penalizing independent reporting about the administration.”\n\nThe Times’ proactive approach stands in contrast to journalists who traditionally let their work stand on its own, and it underscores the shifting environment of a media business under more scrutiny than ever. While mistakes in the past may have once been relegated to a corrections section, the stakes are now much higher, with the wrong words igniting a social media frenzy, or drawing legal threats from the president. \n\n“Letting the journalism speak for itself is an approach from a bygone era,” Patrick Healy, the Times’ assistant managing editor for trust and standards, told TheWrap. “Our audience is understandably asking really tough questions about why and how we publish what we publish — that’s fair, and I think we want to do a better job of opening up our process and how we work in that regard.”\n\nThat defense of proper journalism is critical at a time when mistakes can have devastating consequences. The BBC’s mangled editing of Trump’s Jan. 6 speech in a 2024 documentary prompted him to threaten a lawsuit for somewhere between “$1 billion to $5 billion.” The Times of London, meanwhile, was embarrassed last month after claiming to quote former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio railing against mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani — only to apologize for mistakenly quoting a different man with the same name. De Blasio later questioned whether the Rupert Murdoch-owned U.K. outlet had “abandoned meaningful journalistic standards and ethics.”\n\nAll news organizations have protocols for assessing the veracity of what they publish, though the administration of standards can range from handling grammatical and style matters to CNN’s “triad” approach, which includes a trio of newsroom editors, lawyers and standard-specific editors who drill into a story before it runs. Though integral to newsrooms, standards can be part of the business, with outlets having different practices and processes, and several declined to discuss their specific approaches.\n\nBut today’s perilous legal environment has forced news organizations to be extra-cautious in buttoning up copy and upholding already high standards, while also being willing to defend their journalism in new ways. Several outlets, including the Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Guardian U.S., opened up with TheWrap about operating in a second Trump era and in an era of declining trust in the mainstream media. \n\nAnd while accuracy is important, Healy said, it’s also about “making really public statements, comments on social media and elsewhere, defending our journalism, explaining our journalism, standing up for our reporters and other journalists when they come under attack.”\n\nThe new battleground\n\nIn September, Trump sued the Times and three of its reporters for $15 billion for libel over a series of stories the paper published about the president, his family and his businesses, mostly in the years before his second term.\n\nHealy reiterated the Times’ position that Trump’s lawsuit against the paper has “no merit,” characterizing it as “an attempt to stifle independent reporting and generate PR attention.” But he said such tactics informed the Times’ public approach to handling attacks on its journalism, recognizing that news organizations are facing greater scrutiny from a public inherently distrustful of the outlets that produce the news.\n\n“We’re just very aware of the pressure campaigns and activists from all sides who want the news media to referee and the Times to bend our standards and change our language in their favor, and President Trump and his administration are a big part of that,” Healy said. \n\nTrump’s camp, however, remains consistent in its attack on media.\n\n“President Trump is committed to continue holding those who traffic in lies, deception and fake news accountable for their reckless and politically motivated efforts to defame him and the MAGA movement,” a spokesperson for the president’s outside legal team told TheWrap.\n\nIn this litigious climate, how a news organization commits to its standards department is of new relevance. After a year of legal turmoil over its editorial policies, CBS News lost its head of standards, Claudia Milne, in October in the wake of Bari Weiss’ appointment as its editor-in-chief. \n\nWeiss has since considered dismantling the network’s standards department for “holding too much power,” according to the Independent, after CBS News axed its race and culture unit during layoffs last month. Both departments questioned CBS News anchor Tony Dokoupil’s handling of an interview with writer Ta-Nehisi Coates over the Israel-Gaza conflict, prompting Weiss to defend him in a Free Press editorial last year.\n\n“She also asked openly, ‘What’s the point of standards?’” a CBS News source told the Independent. (CBS News did not respond to a request for comment on its plans for its standards department.)\n\nHealy wouldn’t discuss Weiss’ management of CBS News’ standards department. But he said the Times has increased its standards desk by roughly 10 editors over the last several years. “The standards desk has grown just as the work has grown commensurate with the newsroom expanding,” Healy said.\n\n“Other news organizations are going to make their choices,” Healy added. “I really can’t pass judgment there, but I know for us, standards are core to what the Times does, and having an organized and robust standards desk of really excellent editors is essential to our journalism.”\n\nThe Guardian U.S. has also been “doubling down” on its commitment to its newsroom standards, deputy editor for news Paul Harris told TheWrap. Harris said the U.K.-based paper’s U.S. edition had already maintained a high bar for accuracy — ”We’re not a casual news organization at the best of times, and we’re super not a casual news organization now” — but the president’s hostility toward the press forces the Guardian to work to prevent those who see it as a “political enemy” from latching onto mistakes.\n\n“There’s obviously no doubt that Trump does see the press as the enemy of the people, and the Guardian, as a proudly progressive news organization, is probably not his favorite,” Harris said. “So we would have high newsroom standards anyway, for ethical reasons, but there is now a very solid, obviously practical reason to have them as well.”\n\nHarris said the paper has “definitely” been conducting more legal reviews of its stories than it did in the past, ensuring it was “more careful” in making sure its work stood up to scrutiny. It is also one of the few outlets that continues to employ a public editor, which it calls its “readers’ editor,” to serve as its internal conduit for its audience to scrutinize the newsroom’s reporting and hold it accountable for mistakes. \n\n“We deal with them all the time,” he said. “Sometimes in ways that, as a head editor, you’re on the wrong end of, but that’s just the way it is and it’s also the way it should be.”\n\nThe Journal’s stories aren’t generally receiving additional legal scrutiny, said Elena Cherney, the paper’s head of standards and ethics, but reporters continue to have access to legal advice in the course of their reporting. She said the paper’s ethos of reporting all sides of a story and getting as much information on the record was its north star, one that dated back to when she first started at the Journal in 2000.\n\n“Even then, many other news organizations didn’t expect the same level of reporting rigor from reporters as the Journal did and still does,” she wrote in an email. “Our standards put a big onus on our journalists to go the extra mile.”\n\nTrump continues to issue threats, suggesting in September that he might sue ABC for airing late night host Jimmy Kimmel, and last week called for the host to be fired. He has yet to file a lawsuit against the BBC, though he signaled it would be soon; a spokesperson for the legal team did not answer questions on the lawsuit’s timing. In its apology to Trump last week over the documentary’s editing, the BBC said it believed there was no basis for a defamation claim.\n\nHarris said his paper would remain undeterred in covering the Trump administration, though he noted that even if news organizations report accurately, they could still face legal action. “If the White House wants to come for you, it will anyway,” he said. “It doesn’t necessarily need you to have got your facts wrong to launch a multibillion-dollar lawsuit.”\n\n“The ultimate goal is to kill reporting”\n\nThere’s a reason Trump isn’t hesitating to file one lawsuit after another: He’s been successful at putting various media outlets on their heels.\n\nThe president in December extracted a $16 million settlement from Disney from his defamation suit last year against ABC and George Stephanopoulos, in which the president took issue with Stephanopoulos’ on-air claim that a jury found Trump liable for “rape” instead of its actual finding of “sexual abuse,” a legal distinction in New York. \n\nTrump likewise got a $16 million settlement in July from CBS-parent Paramount over a lawsuit related to how “60 Minutes” edited a Kamala Harris interview, a move critics saw as the company paving the way for regulatory approval of its merger with Skydance. \n\nThe two settlements, paid toward his impending presidential library, appear to have emboldened Trump in his quest to fight news organizations over unflattering stories, forcing companies to shell out millions and alarming media law experts in the process. \n\nThe ultimate goal is to kill reporting and to kill journalism that is less favorable to him.” – Katie Townsend, former Reporters Committee for Free of the Press deputy executive director\n\n“You’re inflicting pain by engaging in the lawfare, whether or not the outcome is ultimately in your favor,” said Katie Townsend, a Gibson Dunn partner and the former deputy executive director and legal director for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. “Donald Trump is very smart about that. He realizes it would ensure pressure, it’s a way to inflict pain, and the ultimate goal is to kill reporting and to kill journalism that is less favorable to him, that’s more critical to him and his administration and his administration’s policies, and that’s the end game.”\n\nAs The Wall Street Journal in July prepared to publish details of an alleged letter Trump sent to Jeffrey Epstein within a sketch of a woman’s nude body for the financier’s 50th birthday, Trump reportedly told the paper he would sue them “just like I sued everyone else.” A day after the story broke, Trump sued the paper and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, for $10 billion for defamation. (The House Oversight Committee in September released the letter allegedly penned by Trump.) \n\nWhile the Journal wouldn’t comment on the president’s lawsuit, Cherney said it remained undeterred in its coverage of the second Trump era, which has produced a string of scoops. (A Dow Jones spokesperson has previously said the paper has “full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit.”)\n\n“It’s less about having rigid standards and more about upholding our existing high standards, which have always been about maintaining reader trust in the fairness and accuracy of our newsgathering,” Cherney wrote in an email. \n\n“Practices like our commitment to ‘no surprises’ journalism, which means we seek to provide a chance for full and fair comment before we publish a story, stand us in good stead at a moment when journalistic practices are under a microscope.”",

        "text": "Seth Meyers had a good laugh at how “smitten” President Trump appeared to be with NYC mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani this week, but immediately zeroed in on the quiet commentary it offers about the rest of the president’s team.\n\nTo kick off his “A Closer Look” segment on Monday night, the NBC host pulled up an image of Trump smiling broadly at Mamdani, as the latter addressed the press. The president’s delight reminded Meyers of “a 5-year-old meeting Mickey Mouse,” but that was just the tip of the iceberg. Mamdani also charmed Trump into walking back several of his previous insults toward the man.\n\n“I’ve never seen Trump this smitten before,” Meyers marveled. “This is a reminder he doesn’t work with a single cool person. He is surrounded by so many charmless goons that the first time he got to hang out with someone who had a little charisma, he swooned like he was on a date with the varsity quarterback.” \n\n“You’d have stars in your eyes too if you spent every day of your life with joyless gargoyles like Stephen Miller and JD Vance, and then you met a 34-year-old social media star who rapped in a halal cart and once appeared in an actual Disney movie,” he continued.\n\nThe late night host then joked that, before cameras started rolling, Trump probably ran through the list of his team for Mamdani and insulted each one individually. Meyers was also amused by the fact that everyone thought there would be tension between Trump and Mamdani during the meeting, with many pundits predicting fireworks.\n\n“They got fireworks, but they were more like those big old heart-shaped fireworks you see in a rom-com,” Meyers joked.\n\nThe standout quote from the meeting though, at least for Seth, was Trump encouraging Mamdani to just stand by his comments and call the president a fascist.\n\n“That is the flirtiest I’ve ever heard anyone say ‘You can call me a fascist,’” Meyers exclaimed. “‘You can call me a fascist. You can call me any– I’ll be whatever you want me to be!’ I’ve never seen someone so desperate to have another male friend. The nervous smile, the giddy laughter, and look, I’m not judging the man. I’ve been there. Reminds me of when I went day drinking with Paul Rudd.”\n\nYou can watch Seth Meyers’ full “A Closer Look” segment in the video above.",

An anonymous source claimed that the group is trying to oust Schumer in the midterm elections. Here’s how Zohran Mamdani has played a crucial role in the boycott.\n\nThe group of liberals is allegedly expressing its disapproval of the Democratic Party’s failure to back Zohran Mamdani as a candidate.

A veteran GOP operative noted how Mamdani’s visit to the White House has only fueled the movement to escalate further.\n\nThe New York elect was pictured at the White House with President Trump. The two men meeting comes after months of them both openly disapproving of each other. The meeting has proven to be a “political grenade,” according to the source who spoke to Julia Manchester.\n\n“To be honest, I think this pours gasoline on the internal war within the Dems,” the veteran noted. According to the insider, the Oval Office meeting will “further force” Democrats to accept Mamdani and “his agenda.”\n\nJosh Orton, a Democratic strategist, explained how the contempt against the leadership is a first. “I can think of no historical example that would compare to this level of internal caucus fear and dissension,” he noted in an interview with The New York Times.\n\nOrton went on to elaborate how “unique” it is for a whole group of senators to oppose the “leadership’s entire disposition toward politics and the Trump administration.” He labeled the group as “essentially a guerrilla group of senators.”\n\nAccording to a report by The New York Times, the group contains Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen, Tina Smith, and Chris Murphy. Other reports have pointed toward the frustration party members are feeling over the lack of fight that the Democratic leadership is putting up against Trump.\n\n WOW: Democrat Rep.

In an interview with Politico, he questioned what the future of the Democratic Party would look like.\n\n“Who is going to be effective? And most Democrats around the country just don’t think that person is Chuck Schumer,” he added.\n\nSchumer’s spokesperson addressed the floating speculation while denying it. Our “North Star is winning the Senate majority in 2026, and any decision is made to achieve that goal,” they noted.",

She is a smarter version of the Blue-haired radical who secretly fantasizes about upending society by working her way up the ladder, as Zohran Mamdani has in New York City. \n\nBoth are reasonably intelligent, attractive, and profoundly dangerous figures, although Mamdani is by far the better talent. \n\nBehn burst on the national scene because some enterprising opposition researcher dug up her now-famous interview, where she revealed the fact that she hates the people she wants to represent in Congress. That's not an unflattering interpretation of what she implied; she said it outright. \n\n🚨 Aftyn Behn-- the Democrat nominee for the upcoming TN07 special election-- says that she despises Nashville, the city that she's running to represent in Congress:“I hate the city, I hate the bachelorettes, I hate the pedal taverns, I hate country music, I hate all of the… pic.twitter.com/L9lmo1YkkJ— Greg Price (@greg_price11) November 19, 2025\n\nOnce the ball got rolling, people started digging up other, uh, questionable things she said about defunding the police, and she has been unwilling to even walk those statements back so far. She went on the friendliest network possible and still couldn't give a straight answer about her beliefs. \n\nQ. So you don't want to clarify whether you still believe that the police should be defunded?Behn: ...once again, I....don't remember these tweets...Q. What is your position today, hows that, on this issue?Behn: .....once again, I'm here to talk about my race, which is,… https://t.co/5HgNBkCsGW— Mary Margaret Olohan (@MaryMargOlohan) November 24, 2025\n\nQ: Representative, in 2020 you made some tweets that have since been deleted, that were very critical of police. You said, in those since-deleted tweets, that the Metropolitan Police Department in Nashville should be dissolved, another shared on a teacher's union tweet that Defund the Police should be a requirement for schools reopening, and another saying \"Good morning to the 54% of Americans who believe that burning down a police station is justified.\" 2020 was a very fraught year. Do you still stand by those comments, and if not, is there anything you want to clarify?BEHN: Uh – I'm not going to engage in cable-news talking points, but what I will say is our communities need solutions, we need local people deciding, solving local problems with local solutions. And that's not the overreach of a federal government or a state government, of which we are dealing with in Nashville and our cities across the state of Tennessee.\n\nBut these incidents just expose that she is a garden-variety liberal, although farther left than many of them. She is arrogant, but not much more so than your typical urban liberal who looks down on the normies while pretending to care about their well-being.\n\nBut it turns out that she is much worse than that, which makes her emblematic of the radical leftward drift of the Democratic Party. \n\nShe seems nice https://t.co/irl5gDlebf— travis4nh (@travis4nh) November 25, 2025\n\nShe is a sociopath in the Jay Jones mold, which is to say just the kind of candidate that the Democratic Party has gravitated toward in recent years. She was likely chosen because she fit the \"optics\" of the kind of candidate who the party thought they could get past the typical voter in Tennessee. Young, attractive, and smooth enough, and not obviously radical unless you get to see behind the facade that she projects. \n\nBut underneath? A sheer will to power and a willingness to dispose of all the things typical people value in the pursuit of that power. \n\nThe goal is to present an \"I'm just like you, only a bit smarter\" vibe. But the reality is that just under the surface is a desire to rule over others.\n\nBehn turns out not to be as smooth at this game as Mamdani, although I am past predicting that she cannot win. Democrats clearly don't care whether their candidates are sociopaths. They share that same will to power, and there don't seem to be limits to how far they will go to seize power. \n\nBehn is running uphill in this race—this is a district where Republicans typically win quite easily. But you can be sure every Democrat will come out to vote because they hate Trump so much, while an early December special election is much less likely to get Republicans to the polls. \n\nIf Jay Jones can win, perhaps even Behn can too. And if she does, expect Democrats to celebrate, despite the fact that she clearly hates the electorate and has contempt for the very people she is asking to vote for her. \n\nThis is somehow called \"saving democracy.\" \n\nEditor’s Note: Every single day, here at Hot Air, we will stand up and FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT against the radical left and deliver the conservative reporting our readers deserve.

        "text": "What conclusions do you draw from your quick introduction to Summers, which, presumably, you stitched together from YouTube Shorts, Wikipedia, and ChatGPT? More to the point, if you believe yourself to be a rational person who draws inferences based on the evidence in front of you, what should you believe?\nIn the past few months, I have been trying to gauge how much of the American public is now convinced that a cabal of pedophiles runs the world. Polls have shown that a significant majority of the country believes that the government has been hiding information about Epstein’s clients and about his death. But there is a difference between suspecting a coverup and going full Pizzagate-conspiracy mode, drawing connections among Summers, Epstein, Trump, Bill Clinton, Mossad, and the sudden rise of the A.I. industry, which now seems to be propping up a large part of the world economy—and then concluding that some shadowy group of oligarchs rules us all.\nThere are some indicators, however, that Planet Epstein has begun to eclipse our previous home. Congress, for example, voted 427–1 to mandate that the Department of Justice publish “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials” linked to its investigation and prosecution of Epstein. That result owed a good deal to Marjorie Taylor Greene, who used to garner national attention primarily as the butt of jokes, but who, prior to her surprise announcement on Friday that she will resign from office in January, had become one of the most visible—and, yes, increasingly respected—politicians in the country. And the fall of powerful figures such as Summers, who escaped scrutiny in the earlier flareups of the Epstein story, suggests that there is a capitulation taking place. Anecdotally, I do not know a single person in my life who truly thinks that this is the end of the story or that every guilty party has been revealed. More crucially, Trump, who can usually count on a third of the country to accept whatever version of the truth he offers, found almost zero audience for his claim of an “Epstein Hoax”—the narrative that continued attention to Epstein is a Democratic plot to embroil his great Administration in scandal and distract from the “greatness” that Republicans are accomplishing. At the very least, elected officials—including those, such as Greene, who have spent the past decade serving as faithful Trump acolytes—have begun to fear the public’s wrath on this issue.\nWhat that insurrectionary energy sought was a single theory of the world, ideally one that did not rely on partisan leanings—or, really, on politics at all. Epstein has provided that. Lest we forget, Epstein died more than six years ago now, and although the story certainly had not been forgotten by the public, it had at least been moved to a low-heat back burner when Greene; Thomas Massie, a U.S. representative from Kentucky; and a handful of other politicians began to talk about the Epstein files again. The ham-fisted response from the Trump Administration certainly didn’t quiet things. The fact that an increasing number of Americans, spurred on by the war in Gaza and by new-media commentators across the political spectrum, were starting to question the influence that Israel had on Washington, D.C., has also played a role.\nA little more than a month ago, I noted that “on Planet Epstein, everything that happens—the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the war in Gaza, the suppression of speech by the Trump Administration—serves as proof that the country is run by blackmail, pedophilia, and fealty to Israel. I do not think very many Americans buy into every part of that story, and I imagine that a great number would be rightfully appalled by the implicit and explicit antisemitism in this view of the world.” In hindsight, I fear that I might have undersold the number of Americans who do believe all those things. I don’t know for sure, of course, as there’s no way to really quantify unrest and suspicion. I also don’t know how, if a good portion of the country now resides on Planet Epstein and wants to upend every American institution, society keeps functioning. What comes next? If you believe that Summers’s extensive appearances in the Epstein files suggest that both Harvard and OpenAI are fundamentally compromised by a child-sex-trafficking ring, and therefore must be burned to the ground, what do you put in their place?\nCould Greene, freed from Congress, and in spite of her past nuttiness and humiliations, become the magnet who pulls together the populist right and the populist left? Probably not. But it wouldn’t surprise me if she ran for President in 2028, possibly as the head of an America First party. (In a statement about her impending resignation, she condemned “the Political Industrial Complex of both Political Parties.”) Nor would it shock me if she chose someone from the insurrectionary left as her running mate. (At a press conference last week about the Epstein files, Greene and Massie were joined by Ro Khanna, the left-wing representative from California, and one of the most visible co-sponsors of the recent Epstein bill.) Such a campaign would certainly feature a lot of talk about Epstein and Israel, and would likely call for a new vision of the country that did away with what Greene called traitors who serve “foreign countries and themselves.” How would such a ticket fare against, say, a standard Democratic ticket anchored by a familiar face like Pete Buttigieg or Gavin Newsom? How would this horseshoe campaign do against J. D. Vance? Maybe not so well; political inertia and the two-party system are still powerful forces, despite the Epstein revolution that’s taking place on every smartphone in the country.\nBut, in the next few years, more politicians will emerge who adopt the crucial positions of this coalition: foreign-policy isolationism and economic populism. Even Zohran Mamdani, who famously said in a mayoral debate that he would not visit Israel because he would be working on New York’s problems—and who pulled off his own unexpected feat on Friday, by charming the President in the Oval Office—adhered, in his campaign, to a version of these tenets. What this suggests is that political life after Trump will be defined by odd ideological pairings that do not follow the political lines of the past twenty years. An abrupt realignment now feels more probable than endless polarization. (Although it’s hard to imagine a political horseshoe that would bend equally toward left and right. More likely, this one will bend toward nativism with lip service paid to widening the public’s social safety net.) Some of the surprises that result from this realignment, such as Mamdani’s unlikely victory, will surely cause both hope and fear, as people grapple with the unexpected. But I do not think that we can fully predict the alliances to come, nor the new order they will bring. ♦",

Jorge discusses his new term \"Trumpwashing\" -- that something like this video isn't newsworthy until Trump denounces it, and then what Trump said was the scandal -- that sedition is punishable by death.\n\nCurtis says his favorite moment from the Sunday shows is where ABC This Week host Martha Raddatz gently tried to nudge Sen. Slotkin into offering proof of an illegal order from Trump, and she ends up telling this tale from former Defense Secretary Mark Esper where Trump allegedly asked about shooting Black Lives Matter protesters in the legs. They always accept these claims when it's Trump. Slotkin threw in the Nuremberg trials, and the movie A Few Good Men instead of any evidence.\n\nJorge noted that while the video may not meet a legal definition of “sedition”, it most certainly meets the elements of 18 USC §2387, which proscribes \"attempts to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty\" by military personnel.\n\nThe whole story as it unfolded suggests that the video was meant to cause a fierce reaction from Trump -- which would explain why the media didn't touch it until Trump reacted. Now the Democrats are actually raising money on the controversy.\n\nEnjoy the podcast video below. The audio is here.",

        "text": "There was no ring on the ring finger of second lady Usha Vance when she visited Camp Lejeune, a military base, alongside first lady Melania Trump earlier this week.\n\nThe duo was photographed on Nov. 19 walking together in North Carolina. And the second lady – the wife of Vice President JD Vance – was seen without her wedding ring, talking to the troops and to the first lady. Despite the online discourse, Vance has been pictured with and without her wedding band on numerous occasions.\n\nBy the time Friday, Nov. 21, rolled around, the split rumors surfaced on social media. Speculation about the state of the second couple's marriage intensified. But Vance, 39, is the first second lady of her kind, a reserved and hesitant public figure, more focused on motherhood than statesmanship.\n\nA spokeswoman for the second lady told USA TODAY in a statement Nov. 21 that Vance is \"a mother of three young children, who does a lot of dishes, gives lots of baths, and forgets her ring sometimes.\" The Vances have three children: Ewan, 8, Vivek, 5, and Mirabel, 3.\n\nOnce viewed simply through the lens of their vows, Vance is among a growing bipartisan group of modern women in America who are bucking the constructs and constraints of political marriages.\n\nWho is Usha Vance? Here's what to know about the incoming second lady\n\nJennifer Siebel Newsom, wife of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, reimagined her role as \"first partner,\" ditching the \"lady\" label due to gendered stereotypes. Michelle Obama has been outspoken during President Donald Trump's second term about the burden of being first lady. Rama Duwaji, married to New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, is an accomplished illustrator who never speaks to the press, offering statements through her artwork on Instagram.\n\nLike Melania Trump, she rarely sits for interviews. Besides an hourlong appearance on Meghan McCain's podcast, sitting as the former \"View\" cohost announced her third pregnancy, Vance has skipped press stops since her husband took office.\n\n\"Interesting. Usha Vance minus wedding ring yesterday at Camp Lejeune,\" Democratic strategist Adam Parkhomenko said on X, incorrectly stating the day of Vance's visit. \"Is JD sleeping on the couch?\" the Democratic Party's official X account said.\n\nUsha Vance skips wearing wedding ring. Why do we care?\n\nBorn and raised in San Diego, Usha Chilukuri was a child of Hindu Indian immigrants and both of her parents are educators.\n\nThe Vances met as students at Yale Law School, where she excelled. \"She seemed some sort of genetic anomaly, a combination of every positive quality a human being should have: bright, hardworking, tall, and beautiful,\" her husband wrote in his 2016 memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" calling the second lady his \"spirit guide.\"\n\nBefore President Trump picked her husband as his running mate, Vance was a lawyer at Munger, Tolles & Olson, a firm that specializes in litigation and corporate law. After Trump won the 2024 presidential election, Vance moved her family from their home in Cincinnati's East Walnut Hills neighborhood to the United States Naval Observatory, the traditional residence of the vice president's family.\n\nDuring her time as second lady, Vance has still been the subject of rumors about the health of her marriage. Kennedy heir Jack Schlossberg, now running for Congress, garnered backlash after joking that he was expecting a baby with Vance.\n\nThe internet ignited in furor after Charlie Kirk's widow, Erika, hugged her husband. Vice President Vance made headlines last month for saying he hoped his wife would convert to Catholicism.\n\n\"Do I hope eventually that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved in by church? Yeah, I honestly, I do wish that, because I believe in the Christian gospel, and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way,\" JD Vance said, speaking at a Turning Point USA event at the University of Mississippi on Oct. 29.\n\n\"But if she doesn't, then God says, 'Everybody has free will,' and so that doesn't cause a problem for me. That's something you work out with your friends, with your family, with the person that you love,\" he added.\n\nThen, of course, the missing ring.\n\nThere are countless reasons why somebody may choose not to wear their wedding band. They took it off to be cleaned. It felt too tight. They left it on the bathroom counter before going to bed that night. In the movies, the wife slips off her wedding ring after an argument or fight. In real life, many people just forget.\n\nVance is busy doing the dishes and giving the kids baths. In America, it could also just be that the second lady's ring and narrative belong to her first.\n\nContributing: Amaris Encinas, Aysha Bagchi",

        "text": "“Late Night” host Seth Meyers on Monday revealed why President Donald Trump was so charmed by New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani during their Oval Office meeting.\n\n“I’ve never seen Trump this smitten before. This is a reminder: He doesn’t work with a single cool person!” Meyers said while showing an image of several Trump officials, including White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Vice President JD Vance. “He is surrounded by so many charmless goons that the first time he got to hang out with someone that had a little charisma, he swooned like he was on a date with the varsity quarterback.”\n\n“You’d have stars in your eyes, too, if you spent every day of your life with joyless gargoyles like Stephen Miller and JD Vance, and then you met a 34-year-old social media star who rapped in a halal cart and once appeared in an actual Disney movie,” he added.\n\nMoments later, Meyers played a clip of Trump interrupting Mamdani after a reporter asked the Democratic socialist about describing the president as a fascist.\n\n“That’s OK, you can just say ‘Yes,’ OK? It’s easier — it’s easier than explaining it, I don’t mind,” Trump said before patting Mamdani on the arm.\n\n“That is the flirtiest I’ve ever heard anyone say, ‘You can call me a fascist,’” Meyers quipped.\n\nHe then launched into his Trump impression: “You can call me a fascist, you can call me — I’ll be whatever you want me to be!”\n\nWatch more of Meyers’ Monday monologue on “Late Night.”",

It assists immigration to Israel. It is a recognized nonprofit organization.\n\nIt seems that, since Mamdani thinks Israel is illegitimate as a Jewish state, he therefore also believes furthering Jewish immigration is an illegal activity.\n\nHis distain of Israel and Jews is open and obvious.\n\nMark Seitelman\n\nThe violent attack on the Park East Synagogue was just a prelude to what’s to come when the openly antisemitic, anti-Israel, pro-Palestinian and pro-BDS Mamdani and his Democratic Party, led by far-left radicals, takes office.\n\nMax Wisotsky\n\nHighland Park, NJ\n\nMamdani doesn’t seem to understand the central story of the Bible is for Jews to return to the actual Holy Land and efforts to do so are not in violation of international law.\n\nIs it even appropriate for a mayor-elect, a Muslim at that, to deny the understanding of another person’s religion in Amer-ica?\n\nAlan Hoffman\n\nEast Windsor, NJ\n\nThis was not an act of free speech or protest.\n\nThis was a test to see what these terrorists could get away with. Next time, it will be worse.\n\nWe need better laws against holding hate rallies outside houses of worship.\n\nCarol Meltzer\n\nMamdani should know that if Jews violate international law by moving or intending to move to Israel, we’ve been doing so for a long time.\n\nThe Amidah, the centerpiece prayer recited by Jews of all denominations, calls on God to “bring us together from the four corners of the Earth into our Land.”​\n\nBy his token, we Jews violate international law every time we open a siddur and have been doing so for almost two millennia.\n\nJeff Elikan\n\nSilver Spring, Md.\n\nNo one should be surprised by this hate-filled protest. The Muslim Brotherhood is here, planning to “transform Western society from within.”\n\nFrom the disruption of college campuses to the normalization of antisemitism, they are on a roll.\n\nRobert Mangi\n\nGarden City\n\nThe Issue: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) announcing her resignation from Congress.\n\nAs a die-hard Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene voter, I think she should retract her resignation immediately (“Shocker! MTG quits Congress,” Nov. 22).\n\nShe used her time in office to torch waste, expose bureaucratic nonsense and say what every fed-up American was thinking.\n\nShe subjected witnesses like Dr. Anthony Fauci, Kimberly Cheatle and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew to withering cross-examinations.\n\nIn 1982, William Safire asked, “Who speaks for the average man?” Today the answer is MTG.\n\nAndrew Delaney\n\nI have come to see MTG as an eccentric trouble-maker over the past five years.\n\nI think her resignation has a lot to do with the fact that President Trump and her congressional colleagues are fed up with her.\n\nShe feels betrayed, and it hurts so much that she can no longer focus on her job, but that’s not on Trump or her party; that’s on her.\n\nIt’s one thing to take your job too seriously, but I think her mistake was taking it too personally.\n\nGood luck to her wherever she goes from here.\n\nArthur Saginian\n\nSanta Clarita, Calif.\n\nWant to weigh in on today’s stories?

        "text": "Michelle Obama has once again captured global attention after sharing fresh behind-the-scenes images from a recent photo shoot. The former first lady's slimmer silhouette and refreshed styling prompted a wave of online reactions, with some social media users speculating about weight loss drugs such as Ozempic. Those claims, however, are unproven and, as many experts caution, unnecessary. Obama has never stated she is taking any medication for weight loss, and commentators warn that sudden online debate about a woman's appearance can be misleading and harmful.\n\nWhy People Reacted Negatively to Michelle Obama\n\nThe photographs in question were taken as part of an update to Annie Leibovitz's celebrated Women portrait series and shared widely across social platforms. In the new shots, Michelle Obama wears relaxed, contemporary clothing and appears leaner than in some earlier public appearances. The pictures were styled for a specific editorial look, which means lighting, angles, retouching and wardrobe all played a major role in how she appeared. Reports that covered the shoot pointed out that the pictures were part of a controlled shoot rather than casual snapshots.\n\nPeople on social media were quick to draw conclusions. With public interest in GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy at an all-time high, many attribute any visible weight change to medication rather than to normal life factors.\n\nCelebrities across the board have faced similar allegations, which sometimes result from new hairstyles, changes in fitness routines, different diets, or simply different photographic contexts. The presence of rumour does not equal proof, and Obama's own social media shows that she is living a happy and fulfilling life.\n\nREAD MORE: Is Donald Trump Copying Zohran Mamdani? Internet Explodes Over His New Look\n\nWhy the Ozempic Angle is Misleading\n\nThe viral claim that Michelle Obama is on Ozempic has no factual basis beyond unverified online speculation. As of this writing, there is no statement from Obama or her representatives confirming the use of GLP-1 drugs. All publications reporting on the new pictures noted that such claims remain unverified. Public figures also retain the right to privacy about medical matters and should not be the subject of casual diagnosis on social media.\n\nMedical experts and photo professionals highlight many harmless reasons why a person might look different from one image to the next. Ageing, natural hormonal changes such as menopause, adjustments to diet and exercise, hydration levels and temporary fluctuations in body composition can all change the way someone appears. Professional photographers also use composition, lens choice, retouching and lighting to create a particular mood or aesthetic. Any one of those factors could explain the change without invoking medication.\n\nThe Cultural Cost of Speculation\n\nThere is a real cultural cost to turning every change in a woman's appearance into a conspiracy. When public reaction leaps straight to prescription drugs, it overlooks the full humanity of the person photographed.\n\nMichelle Obama has long been vocal about healthy living and body confidence, and she has faced intrusive commentary before. Spreading unfounded claims risks normalising a culture that imagines medical interventions where none have been proven. Fact checking and thoughtful reporting matter as social media reactions are rarely reliable. Currently, Michelle Obama appears to enjoy a strong family and social life, alongside running other ventures including her podcast and public outreach projects.\n\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK",

        "text": "Socialism has failed every time it has been tried because it is impossible for a group of people to implement a centralized governing apparatus capable of effectively organizing society. \n\nHeretofore, most people have resented and rejected the yoke of socialism, sometimes after long struggles, because collectivism is also antithetical to individual autonomy, free will, human nature, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nThis is not the case in the United States. Today, more than 30 years after the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, young Americans want socialism. \n\nAccording to new polling conducted by Rasmussen Reports and The Heartland Institute, which included 1,496 likely voters aged 18 to 39, more than half of young Americans want a democratic socialist to win the White House in 2028.\n\nLikewise, more than half of those polled have a favorable impression of New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, and nearly 60 percent support socialist policies like a nationwide rent freeze and government-run grocery stores in every town.\n\nSEE ALSO: Mamdani Wants Gov't-Run Grocery Stores in NYC. Here's How Well That's 'Working' in Kansas City.\n\nThere are many reasons why socialism appeals to young Americans. \n\nFirst and foremost, young people are not being taught about the dark history of socialism. Second, they are misled into believing that socialism is superior to free-market capitalism. Third, they are brainwashed into believing that collectivism is more righteous, fair, and just than personal freedom. Fourth, they feel that the American dream is dead and socialism is the solution to the cost-of-living crisis they face.\n\nNearly three-in-four young likely voters think the cost of housing is at a crisis level, and only 22 percent think they will be better off than their parents. \n\nAt this point in time, given the economic headwinds they face, coupled with their ignorance of socialism, it makes sense that an alarming portion of young Americans want socialism.\n\nRELATED: Magic Fairies and Pixie Dust: Listen to What Mamdani Says About Funding for 'Free' Buses in NYC\n\nEven more concerning, many young Americans also want to give an advanced AI system the authority to control the majority of public policy decisions. More than 40 percent of young likely voters are okay with letting AI, not human beings, determine the laws, rules, and regulations that govern society. More than a third think AI should revise the Constitution, be granted to authority to determine individual rights, and run the world’s largest militaries.\n\nThe reality that almost half of young Americans want AI to govern society, combined with the fact that more than half also want socialism, makes for a dangerous proposition.\n\nWhat if AI could make socialism feasible? What if AI and quantum computing could organize enormous amounts of data in real time and develop an efficient centralized system that could monitor and control everything? \n\nTheoretically, an AI-based socialist system could do a far better job than human-led bureaucracies when it comes to redistributing wealth, calculating and distributing resources, monitoring the population, etc.\n\nModern, AI-infused socialism could be billed as incorruptible, all-knowing, and most importantly, effective.\n\nUnlike the vast centralized bureaucracies that utterly failed to micromanage economies, an AI-driven command-and-control economy could use ruthless efficiency to guarantee equal outcomes.\n\nOf course, an AI-generated socialist utopia, in which Marx’s dream of “From each according to their ability, to each according to their need” is finally realized, could turn into a dystopian nightmare.\n\nBefore this happens, I hope young people realize that socialism is the problem, not the solution. Even more importantly, I hope they understand that liberty, free will, and individual autonomy are blessings that ought to be protected from any encroachment, whether from humans or machines.\n\nChris Talgo (ctalgo@heartland.org) is editorial director at The Heartland Institute.\n\nEditor's Note: President Trump is leading America into the \"Golden Age\" as Democrats try desperately to stop it. \n\nHelp us continue to report on President Trump's successes.

        "text": "Slick article\n\nI thank the Miami Herald for publishing the Nov. 20 article concerning the opening of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico to oil drilling and the after-effects of this action. Articles like these are crucial in protecting Florida’s extremely unique environments and thereby protecting the massive tourist industry alongside it.\n\nExpressing Florida residents’ concerns as a result of the previous oil spill is crucial in reflecting people’s views and stating how elected officials are representing their districts is an amazing example of the power of democracy. The article emphasizes the people’s views and the power of democracy at its finest.\n\nFrederick Landsea,\n\nPalmetto Bay\n\nCode of ethics\n\nPresident Trump’s latest rant about the congressmen who told military members they don’t have to follow illegal orders shows that Trump is ignorant or is trying to win the public relations contest by misrepresenting what they said. They stated what is in the U.S. military code: that service members have a duty to refuse orders that require the commission of a crime, violate the Constitution, federal law or clear international law obligations.\n\nFurthermore, if the military or its members commit a crime, they can be prosecuted by article 92 in the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Unlike Trump, they don’t have immunity and following orders is not a get out of jail card.\n\nThis might have been a factor in Admiral Alvin Holsey’s unexpected early retirement from Southcom, as the legality of the strikes in the Caribbean is extremely dubious and may come back to jeopardize military personnel who did them.\n\nTrump probably doesn’t understand that the military swore an oath to follow the Constitution, not the commander-in-chief’s orders if they are unconstitutional or unlawful.\n\nJose Teijeiro,\n\nWho would have thought it would come to this?\n\nGeorgia U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is now the voice of reason in the Republican Party. And for that, she is called a traitor and getting death threats. Unbelievable.\n\nNorman Segall,\n\nCoral Gables\n\nHighest hypocrisy\n\nIsn’t it rich and at the same time pathetic to hear Donald Trump threaten some elected members of Congress with “death” because they encouraged active military members to refuse to obey an illegal order?\n\nTrump justifies this as seditious behavior.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, Trump’s conduct and speech invited a mob of his MAGA followers to rebel against the authority of the U.S. Congress and the Constitution. That is seditious behavior. Trump was impeached. He also should have been convicted and imprisoned for his role in the events of Jan. 6.\n\nHe says he wants death. If so, for whom?\n\nDavid Kahn,\n\nPoints to consider\n\nRe: the Nov. 20 op-ed, “Does Trump have a tipping point?” I smiled as I read John M. Crisp’s theoretical proposition. It affirms everything I have told friends and family alike about the president. From past history to current events, Trump has been untouchable, getting away with everything he has wanted to do — with the unwavering assistance of his MAGA supporters.\n\nThere is no tipping point when your base is a political cult led by a charismatic person who orders the beliefs, behaviors and customs of all members. The cult’s characteristics convey authoritarian control, extreme beliefs, isolation from society and veneration of a single individual.\n\nTrump’s supporters are too deeply invested in him to conclude they were wrong. Doing so would tacitly be admitting they were duped, conned and lacked the wisdom to know any better. That embarrassing conclusion would prevent any MAGA supporter from reaching the tipping point.\n\nEdward Blanco,\n\nReducing exposure\n\nFor decades, PFAS (per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances), have been a class of synthetic chemicals used in products such as nonstick cookware, firefighting foam, stain-resistant fabrics and food packaging. Dubbed “forever chemicals” because they don’t break down easily in the environment, PFAS can accumulate in soil, water, even in the human body. Long-term exposure has been linked to liver damage, suppression of the immune system, thyroid disease and various cancers.\n\nPFAS have been detected in rainwater and some public water sources across Miami-Dade County, though testing shows levels remain below federal and state safety limits. Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department regularly monitors the contaminants. Residents concerned about exposure are encouraged to use certified water filters or have their tap water tested.\n\nElsewhere in Florida, PFAS contamination has drawn more urgent attention: elevated levels in groundwater and private wells near military bases, airports and industrial sites have prompted some counties to provide bottled water or install filtration systems. Communities in Pensacola, Orlando and Tampa have all reported PFAS above advisory levels, making this a state-wide problem.\n\nWith federal regulation still evolving, Florida continues to grapple with how to effectively monitor, limit and remediate persistent pollutants.\n\nJonathan Rubin,\n\nTastes change\n\nZohran Mamdani, the mayor-elect of New York City, obviously hit a nerve with most New York City voters. Mary Anne Mancuso’s Nov. 16 op-ed, “Miami GOP is right to sound the alarm on Mamdani,” did not mention how those New Yorkers came to support Mamdani.\n\nWhen members of a society are continually exposed to the greed and avarice of corporations and political cronyism, they begin to feel hopeless. They start thinking about change.\n\nThis has happened in the past and unfortunately, history repeats itself if lessons were not learned the first time. Today, this is especially true for our young people, who face excessive college debt, often lack a decent living wage and starter homes that can cost half a million dollars and up.\n\nMancuso writes that the distinction between communism and democratic socialism doesn’t matter. Apparently, it does. When we talk about wealth in our country, we look at median and average household income. The numbers can become skewed because the top tier includes billionaires and millionaires.\n\nMancuso further warns us that this threat of democratic socialism will bring more government intervention. Where has she been for the past 10 months?\n\nCutting SNAP benefits from children and the elderly, healthcare costs skyrocketing and ICE rounding up immigrants without due process is the epitome of government intervention.\n\nMancuso cautions us to remember history and warns others not to repeat it. That warning might be the only point of agreement she and I have.\n\nKathleen C. Fleischman,\n\nMiami Springs\n\nFloating library\n\nThe Presidential Library, which will be built on Biscayne Boulevard, will be a fitting tribute to Donald Trump and his presidency.\n\nOf course, it will have to be built on stilts, because after a hundred years of rising sea levels, the Atlantic Ocean will be lapping at its foundation and, in the distance, Miami Beach will be just a memory.\n\nJames Gross,\n\nNational Hurricane Center meteorologist,\n\nSouth Miami\n\nFat of the land\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio has issued an initiative that will affect me directly: a ban on obesity. I can understand why a nation would want their citizens as healthy as possible (although having visited the U.S. on several occasions, I didn’t see many salad bars).\n\nA guiding principle in life is that all people are equal, irrelevant of gender, race, religion. Now apparently, not bulk. Many in the world are obese, especially in the U.S., so I might have to cross it off my list.\n\nI would probably also be crossed off the list given that not all of my letters to the editors have praised President Trump, who looks like he is also in the obese category. Dennis Fitzgerald,\n\nMelbourne, Australia\n\nThat’s all folks!\n\nSo, can we now tell any woman, “Shut up, piggy?”\n\nAsking for a friend.\n\nMarcelo Salup,\n\nCoral Gables",

        "text": "Today we discuss Texas, overreaction and the voluminous field of candidates for California governor.\n\nIs there anyone who is not running for governor?\n\nI'm not. And neither are my two cats. At least they weren't as of this morning, when we discussed the race before breakfast.\n\nThat leaves us somewhat short of the 135 candidates who ran in California's 2003 recall gubernatorial election. But not by much.\n\nI count nearly a dozen serious candidates, with possibly more to come. Why so many?\n\nOpportunity.\n\nThis is the most wide-open race for California governor in decades. By comparison, you'd have to go back to at least 1998, when Lt. Gov. Gray Davis surged past a pair of moneybag candidates, Al Checchi and Rep. Jane Harman, in the Democratic primary, then stomped Republican Attorney General Dan Lungren in November to win the general election.\n\nNow, as then, there is no one who even remotely resembles a prohibitive front-runner.\n\nPolling in the governor's race has shown former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter and Chad Bianco, Riverside County's Republican sheriff, narrowly leading the field. But with support for both in the middling 13%-to-21% range, we're not talking about a pair of world-beaters.\n\nLike nature, political ambition abhors a vacuum.\n\nSpeaking of moneybags...\n\nTom Steyer!\n\nAfter making a bundle as a hedge fund manager, the San Francisco billionaire and environmental activist has been panting after public office for years. Running for president didn't work out in 2020, even after Steyer spent more than $345 million on his effort. (That's close to what the Dodgers spent on their 2025 payroll.)\n\nSo now Steyer is running for governor, a move he appeared to telegraph by airing nearly $13 million in self-promotional ads that, oh yes, supported passage of Proposition 50, the Democratic gerrymander initiative.\n\nWhat are his chances?\n\nLongtime readers of this column - both of you! - will know I make no predictions.\n\nBut California voters have never looked favorably upon rich candidates trying to make the leap from political civilian to the governorship or U.S. Senate. In fact, over the last 50-plus years, a gilded gallery of the well-to-do have tried and spectacularly failed.\n\nPerhaps Steyer will display the policy chops or the razzle and dazzle they all lacked. But his launch video certainly didn't shatter any molds. Rather, it presented a stereotypical grab bag of redwood trees, potshots at Sacramento, multicultural images of hard-working-everyday-folk, a promise to fight, a pledge to build more housing and, of course, a dash of profanity because, gosh darn it, nothing says \"unbridled authenticity\" like a political candidate swearing!\n\nMaybe his fellow billionaire, Rick Caruso, will show more creativity and imagination if he gets into the governor's race.\n\nAt least Democrats have been showing signs of life.\n\nIndeed. Dare I say, the party's mood swing from near-suicidal to euphoric has been quite something.\n\nWinning gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia - not by a little, but a lot - and prevailing in down-ballot contests in Pennsylvania and Georgia had a remarkably transformative effect. (Zohran Mamdani's mayoral victory in sky-blue New York City was no big surprise once the democratic socialist prevailed in the primary.)\n\nLiterally overnight, Democrats seized the momentum heading into the 2026 midterm election, while Republicans have begun scrambling to reposition their party and recraft its messaging.\n\nAll that being said, even before their buoyant off-year performance those widespread reports of Democrats' demise were greatly ... well, we'll leave that Mark Twain chestnut alone. As analyst Charlie Cook points out, 2024 was a deeply disappointing year for the party. But it wasn't a disaster.\n\nDemocrats gained two House seats. There was no net change in any of the 11 gubernatorial races and legislative contests across 44 states ended in something close to a wash. The party lost four Senate seats - and control of the chamber - but three of those losses came in the red states of Montana, Ohio and West Virginia.\n\n\"This is not to argue that Democrats had a great night in November 2024, but it certainly wasn't a massacre or a party-wide repudiation,\" Cook wrote in a recent posting. \"If voters had intended to take it out on the party as a whole, the results would have looked quite different.\"\n\nRather than a wholesale takedown of Democrats, the result seemed very much a rejection of President Biden and, by extension, his hasty replacement on the ballot, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWhat does that mean going forth?\n\nIf you're asking whether Democrats will win control of the House or Senate...\n\n...I haven't a clue.\n\nDemocrats need to gain three seats to take control of the House and both history and Trump's sagging approval ratings - especially as pertains to the economy - augur well for their chances. The president's party has lost House seats in 20 of the last 22 midterm elections and, according to Inside Elections, the fewest number of seats that flipped was four.\n\nThat's why I thought Proposition 50, which sets out to all but decapitate California Republicans in Congress, was a bad and unnecessary move, effectively disenfranchising millions of non-Democratic voters.\n\nAn appeals court last week tossed out a Republican gerrymander in Texas, putting Democrats in an even stronger position, though the legal wrangling is far from over. The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the decision, pending review. And still to come is a high court ruling that could gut the Voting Rights Act and yield Republicans a dozen or more House seats nationwide.\n\nSo the fight for control is far from decided.\n\nAs for the Senate, Republicans stand a much better chance of keeping control, given how the seats contested in 2026 are located on largely favorable GOP terrain.\n\nBut until the votes are counted, nobody knows what will happen. That's the thing about elections: they help keep wiseacres like me honest.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025, Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

        "text": "Kellyanne Conway, a former senior counselor to President Donald Trump, said Monday on Fox News that she thinks socialist New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani lost some of his credibility during his Friday meeting with the president.\n\nConway said during an appearance on “The Five” that her former boss got the better of Mamdani during the Oval Office sit-down, which has been widely described as stunningly friendly and civil in spite of the previous animosity between the two New York politicians. The former Trump advisor also said that the president demonstrated during the meeting his “classic” ability to charm people across the political spectrum, which she likened to a “gravitational pull.”\n\n“I think Mamdani would have done better saying ‘no’ to the meeting. He’s reduced some of his credibility among the folks who basically are addled with Trump Derangement Syndrome and essentially look at Trump and say, ‘The more that he enrages me, the less I should engage him,'” Conway said. “And Mamdani did the opposite here.” (RELATED: Everyone ‘Got Played’: Curtis Sliwa Says Americans Were ‘Suckers’ Going Into Trump-Mamdani Meeting)\n\n“This is classic Trump. He’s the charmer here,” the Republican strategist added. “He’s charming this guy who hasn’t even taken office yet, and he’s hoping that this guy will not follow through on some of his radical ideas, hope that he will rethink some of his non-radical ones.”\n\n“And for a movement, Jessica, that talks about ‘No Kings,’ you got Trump sitting there like royalty, and the guy looking like he’s going to go get him a Diet Coke,” Conway said, addressing “The Five” co-host and Democratic strategist Jessica Tarlov, and referencing the president’s favorite beverage. “It looked like the apprentice to the senior partner, no doubt.”\n\n“But this is classic Trump. He did this with Barack Obama and Joe Biden during transition. Same kind of meeting. He congratulated Hillary Clinton when he beat her and said, ‘Wow, she ran a really tough campaign. She’s really tough’. He hopes she’ll help in his presidency. Of course, she did nothing of the sort,” Conway said.\n\nThe Republican strategist said Mamdani could have either more directly confronted or ignored Trump but instead let himself become “cowed” by the president.\n\n“Imagine if Mandami had gone in there and said, ‘Look, I disagree with things you’re doing. Here are the names of the people who have been abducted by ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and deported unfairly. He did nothing like that. He looked totally cowed and charmed to be there,” Conway said. “If you really wanted to make Donald Trump irrelevant and wish him away, you would ignore him.”\n\nShe added that in the decade since Trump announced his run for president in the 2016 election, she has “never encountered” who could “actually ignore” him.\n\n“He [Trump] is a gravitational pull. He is a magnetic field,” Conway said, giving examples of the U.S. president’s recent meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\nThe Republican strategist said she hopes Trump and Mamdani “work together for the good of New York and the good of the country.”\n\nDuring a Sunday interview on “Meet the Press,” Mamdani said he still considers Trump to be a fascist following their meeting, after he was pressed on the topic by NBC News’ Kristen Welker.\n\n“And that’s something that I’ve said in the past. I say it today,” the avowed socialist politician told Welker. “And, I think, what I appreciated about the conversation that I had with the president was that we were not shy about the places of disagreement about the politics that has brought us to the moment.”\n\nDuring the Friday meeting, a reporter asked Mamdani if he stood by past remarks calling the president a “fascist.” As Mamdani seemed about to answer the question, Trump jokingly interjected, “That’s OK, you can just say yes … I don’t mind.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

        "text": "Linville A. M. McDonough is a University of Maine at Farmington student majoring in political science and minoring in creative writing.\n\nFor years, the Democratic National Committee has gotten involved in state races. And for years, this has been viewed as a positive. Support from the DNC has meant more funding for a race and extra help for Democratic candidates. But what happens when candidates are not chosen by those who live in the state? \n\nOutside funding has too much influence in state politics, and now Maine has become involved in the battle of wills over who should represent us and the Democratic Party.\n\nThe party leaders are becoming increasingly out of touch with everyday voters. They fear losing votes, but at the same time, they are blind to what American voters need. Interest has shifted intensely to Maine heading into 2026, with the Senate seat held by Susan Collins being eyed as a potential seat to flip. \n\nIn 2020, the DNC poured money into our state, hoping a Democrat could defeat Susan Collins. Ads were run with statements saying that Susan Collins had lost touch with Maine. \n\nA connection to Collins’ voters has always been her family’s history in Aroostook County. However, many people think that Collins’ time in D.C. has caused her to forget her roots. She has become more easily swayed into supporting bills that ultimately harm Mainers. We need a fresh face with a fresh perspective. That has been clear for years now. \n\nIn 2020, the DNC chose Sara Gideon to run against her, and she gained support from outside organizations. Polls taken at that time showed she had a good chance of winning. However, when the election results were announced, Gideon secured only 42% of the vote. It became clear that she had not been the optimal choice for Maine. Polling had failed to adequately represent working-class and rural Mainers, an unbelievably ridiculous mistake. \n\nIt did not matter what her polices were when it came down to the wire. As a candidate, she was unable to meld with voters in the 2nd Congressional District. Susan Collins’ Mainer roots were valued more than any change Gideon could bring. People felt a lack of connection with someone from Rhode Island, but that was ignored. The DNC had stuck its fingers in the race, but it didn’t understand how Maine works. \n\nWere Maine voters not asked who they wanted to represent them? Did they have enough of a say in the process? I don’t think we did. The Democrats acknowledged the problem, but the DNC has failed to agree on a solution. Will we see a repeat of the same mistakes made in 2020, again in 2026?\n\nGraham Platner announced his run against Susan Collins with much support from both the 1st and 2nd congressional districts and liberal, moderate and conservative voters alike. He’s an oyster farmer, a veteran and a Mainer in all the best ways. His kindness and ability to reach out to people and build bridges has proven to be very successful, as he visits every town hall he can in this time.\n\nPlatner certainly has not been without controversy, but he has approached his past with an honest attitude, which most people appreciate. He has acknowledged and apologized for the offensive things he has said, and has spoken openly about his military service, his PTSD, his depression and the dark times in his life. \n\nWhat should be focused on is his ability to overcome these challenges and learn from his mistakes, but the Democrats in D.C. have started using his past mistakes as leverage against him to support their chosen candidate. \n\nThey will likely spend a similar amount of money on anti-Platner campaigns to Susan Collins’ team. They did it with Zohran Mamdani, and they have even more motivation to get that Senate seat in the hands of someone they believe is best for us, Mainers. Or rather, the party. Whether we like it or not, money can tip the scale in a politician’s favor. It just depends on who has it and what their goals are.\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer and others have convinced Gov. Janet Mills, after months of persuasion and promises of support, to run against Susan Collins. Janet Mills has accomplished many good things for Maine, but she’s 77 and has been in politics for a long time. She has a history that can make her unintentionally biased. \n\nMills would likely not run for a second term due to age. Consistency in who represents our state is important, but I’m not sure the DNC is thinking ahead for Maine’s future. \n\nIt is hard to deny that some of Schumer’s support for Mills is self-motivated. Platner has said he is willing to go against Schumer if he thinks it’s in our best interest. Platner has also spoken out against corruption and has not been shy in saying he sees some of it in the Democratic Party.\n\nThe DNC’s involvement with this race so far is proof of its prejudice toward certain candidates, and it seems an awful lot like abuse of power or even corruption. Regardless of whether it’s money-motivated or not, the Democratic Party has been resistant to new candidates who want to shake things up. There is an unofficial club, and only approved Democrats are allowed to join.\n\nNew York and Mamdani are prime examples. Democrats in D.C. supported Andrew Cuomo despite clear cues from the people of New York City, who wanted Mamdani. Obviously, Platner differs from Mamdani in many ways, but there are similarities between them. \n\nBoth have been tailored by their generation’s experience growing up, and both have clear goals for the future and are willing to fight for them. And both are being put against DNC-funded candidates who are already entrenched in politics.\n\nIt seems to me, and my generation, that every time we have a candidate who is outspoken and different, the DNC actively works against them. They are suppressing valuable voices, and candidates who inspire young voters and connect with everyday people are being overlooked before they have a chance to prove themselves. \n\nI don’t want Maine to become a victim of the DNC’s meddling and uninformed outside opinions again. Maine voters know what Maine needs, and we need to be left alone to figure it out.",

However, months of this fearful rhetoric was swiftly undercut upon Trump actually meeting Mamdani last Friday. Meyers noted that Trump seemed practically smitten by Mamdani, even jumping to his defence several times during a press conference.\"That is the flirtiest I've ever heard anyone say, 'you can call me a fascist,'\" quipped Meyers. \"I've never seen someone so desperate to have another male friend. The nervous smile, the giddy laughter. And look, I'm not judging the man. I've been there.\"Elected as New York's next mayor earlier this month, Mamdani has long been a vocal critic of Trump. Considering the president's history of hitting out at his detractors, few likely expected them to be amicable, much less that Trump would apparently try to endear himself to Mamdani.\"[Fox News host] Sean Hannity is like, 'all my friends in New York are scared,'\" Meyers said. \"And meanwhile Trump is like, 'I have a friend in New York too, his name is Zohran.

        "text": "A communist went to the White House Friday. I was working in the Reagan administration when former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev came to the White House in 1987. To be honest, many of us were not happy.\n\nJust as President Reagan was, we were very dubious about the Soviet Union. Reagan had devoted his presidency to bringing “the evil empire” down. Of course, we were also welcoming a head of state for an official visit, and the flag of the Soviet Union was displayed on Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nA lot has happened since then. The Soviet Union is gone, but today’s Marxists are not bred in Moscow. They are bred in the United States, on our university campuses, and make their home in the Democrat Party.\n\nFriday afternoon, President Trump met the mayor-elect of New York City, Zohran Mamdani. There is no doubt that Mamdani is a Marxist Islamist, yet he won 50% of the vote in a three-way race.\n\nBefore the White House meeting, the House of Representatives voted on a resolution to denounce the horrors of socialism. It should have been unanimous, but the vote was 285 to 98. Every Republican present voted for the resolution, but 53% of House Democrats present voted against the resolution. Ponder the implications of that.\n\nBy the way, when I said a communist was coming to the White House, I was quoting the delightful White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. I visit the White House often and I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall at Friday’s meeting, which was described as cordial.\n\nSpeak with reporters after their meeting, President Trump stressed that he and Mamdani have disagreements, but he loves New York City and wants to see it thrive.\n\nNow, one of them believes you do that by punishing success and trying what has failed all over the world. The other believes in spurring economic growth, reducing regulations, and putting more police on the streets. Their meeting Friday may well be the “closest” they will ever be.\n\nSome analysts say that neither man’s base will be satisfied with Friday’s meeting. I can’t speak for Mamdani’s radical supporters, but President Trump has been willing to meet with anyone his entire political career, unlike the “dictator” Democrats and the media portray him to be.\n\nOut-Of-Control Corruption\n\nThe news out of Minnesota lately has not been so “nice.” A 77th defendant was just indicted in Minneapolis for his role in a massive scheme to defraud American taxpayers of $250 million in COVID relief funds.\n\nThe money was supposed to feed children in need during the pandemic. According to federal prosecutors, only 3% of the money actually went to feeding children. Many of the people involved in this scheme are members of the Minneapolis Somali community.\n\nHere’s another outrage.\n\nThe state of Minnesota just shut down a program to help seniors and people with disabilities secure housing. Why would they do that given the current housing affordability crisis? Exploding costs were a big reason.\n\nWhen the program was established in 2020, it was expected to cost around $2.6 million. But the next year, the program spent 8 times more than that. The following year, it spent 16 times more. When the program was shut down last month, it was on track to spend more than $120 million this year.\n\nHow do you go from spending $2.6 million to $120 million? Fraud. Six Somalis were just indicted for stealing money from the program.\n\nFederal prosecutor Joe Thompson said the “vast majority” of this program was pure fraud funneled through “fictitious companies solely created to defraud the system.” Thompson added:\n\n“What we see are schemes stacked upon schemes, draining resources meant for those in need… I have spent my career as a fraud prosecutor, and the depth of the fraud in Minnesota takes my breath away.”\n\nBut that’s not all.\n\nA similar thing happened with the state’s program to assist children with special needs. Medicaid autism claims in Minnesota went from $3 million in 2018 to $400 million in 2023.\n\nDuring that time, the number of autism treatment centers and providers went from 41 to 328—many were newly established centers in the Somali community. When the fraud was finally discovered, the rate of “autism” among Somali children was more than three times the state average—all part of the fraud.\n\nWhat happened to all that money meant to help Americans in need? Much of it was sent to terrorists in Somalia who want to kill Americans. One off-the-record source said, “The largest funder of Al-Shabaab [terrorists] is the Minnesota taxpayer.”\n\nMedia & Political Malfeasance\n\nWhy is this story not major headlines? It is in conservative media sources, but Big Media won’t touch it because it doesn’t serve the cause of the radical globalists.\n\nThe last thing they want you to know is that the corruption of Somalia actually followed the Somalians who came to Minnesota and now live in the part of Minneapolis known as “Little Mogadishu.” (Mogadishu is the capital of Somalia.)\n\nThree key people were either clueless or complicit in this corruption. Either they had no idea, which is impossible to believe given the extent of the fraud, or they just didn’t act because it didn’t serve their purposes.\n\nOne is the man who almost became vice president of the United States—Governor Tim Walz. Another is Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, who now serves as Minnesota’s attorney general. Ellison aggressively goes after conservatives, but not corrupt Somalis. The final individual is Rep. Ilhan Omar.\n\nDonald Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, and Omar deserves a prize for being the world’s greatest ingrate. America rescued her from an African refugee camp. But all she does is trash America, accuse American troops and our allies of war crimes, and stoke radical Islamism. And she is a hero and a role model to young Muslim girls all over America.\n\nTaxpayer money was diverted from needy Americans by Islamists in America and sent to avowed terrorists who want to kill us!\n\nAnd the Democrat leadership of Minnesota and the leftist media don’t care. The only reason we know anything at all is because of investigative journalism by conservative media outlets and appointees of President Trump.\n\nMigration Matters\n\nThe mass migration of Somalians to Minnesota began during Bill Clinton’s administration, when a civil war broke out in Somalia. The migration to the U.S. continued under several administrations.\n\nMinnesota should be a Republican state. It has a similar profile to much of the Midwest—states like Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. We have won all those states, but not Minnesota. It has many working-class people who were left behind by globalism.\n\nBut to win Minnesota, you have to win the greater Minneapolis area, which now has a significant number of Muslim voters. Former Minnesota state senator David Gaither said:\n\n“If you’re a politician, it’s a significant disadvantage for you to alienate the Somali community. If you don’t win the Somali community, you can’t win Minneapolis. And if you don’t win Minneapolis, you can’t win the state. End of story.”\n\nSo, mass immigration from a corrupt nation has put Minnesota firmly in the Democrat column. Moreover, the political influence of the Muslim vote prevented a Jew, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, from being on the 2024 Democrat presidential ticket.\n\n“Diversity” is not our strength—especially when immigrants from cultures that despise Western values refuse to assimilate. This “diversity” will be our destruction.\n\nBy the way, 47 mosques have reportedly opened in Texas in the past two years. One analysis finds there are at least 330 mosques in the state today.\n\nA Real “Both Sides” Problem\n\nSince there is news that the Bush family is plotting a political comeback, here’s a little reminder. After 9/11, George W. Bush wanted to visit a mosque ASAP. Why? To reassure Muslims that we were not at war with Islam.\n\nAt the time, I thought it was a bad joke. Muslims should have been rushing to the White House to reassure Bush that the “religion of peace” was not at war with us!\n\nBut another way Bush tried to reassure Muslims was to import more of them from the Third World—a trend Barack Obama and Joe Biden were all too happy to continue.\n\nThe Uniparty Comes Together\n\nThursday, the Uniparty that has frustrated so many of us for decades gathered in Washington, D.C., for Dick Cheney’s funeral.\n\nWhy would Anthony Fauci get an invitation to Cheney’s funeral? Because he is a creation of Cheney, who wanted Fauci to outsource biological experiments to other countries because it was illegal to do them here. Fauci did his job—sending money to the Wuhan lab!!\n\nWhy was Rachel Maddow there? She called Cheney every name in the book every night on MSDNC while he was vice president. What do they have in common? Only one thing I can think of: they both hate Trump and voted for Harris in the last election.\n\nWhy is James Carville there? The “Ragin Cajun” made his living attacking the Bushes and the Cheneys.\n\nBut they all come together to resist the populist president who wants to help the average American.\n\nLock Them Up!\n\nRemember Antifa, the group that Donald Trump designated as a terrorist organization? Democrats claim the group doesn’t even exist.\n\nWell, five members of the non-existent group were just convicted on terrorism charges for their roles in the July 4th ambush of a Texas immigration detention facility. \n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio has ordered nearly 300 State Department employees who were denied promotions during the Biden administration because of discriminatory “diversity, equity, and inclusion” policies to be compensated and promoted. \n\nA California school district dropped its appeal after losing a lawsuit over its radical gender ideology programs that forced elementary students to read books promoting transgenderism to kindergartners. \n\nFathers in Maine are collecting signatures for a ballot initiative to protect girls’ sports from cheating boys. More men in other states should follow their example to defend their daughters. \n\nLast year, pregnancy resource centers provided over $452 million in medical care, education services, and material goods to women who made the choice of life. Please support your local pregnancy resource center. \n\nDisney dropped references to “diversity, equity, and inclusion” during a recent employee event and from its 2025 business report—a small but notable win.",

        "text": "Renowned comedian Louis C.K. was recently seen sharing a passionate kiss with Mimi O’Donnell, the longtime partner of the late actor Philip Seymour Hoffman. This encounter comes 11 years after Hoffman’s tragic overdose.\n\nThe 58-year-old comedian, who faced widespread backlash after confessing to several sexual misconduct allegations in 2017, has been in the spotlight again. Most recently, he defended his decision to perform at a comedy festival in Saudi Arabia.\n\nDuring a romantic walk in New York City, C.K. and O’Donnell were observed closely embracing, with C.K. tenderly placing his hand on O’Donnell’s head as they paused for several kisses.\n\nO’Donnell, approximately 55, currently serves as the head of scripted fiction at Spotify. She had a 15-year partnership and three children with Hoffman, the acclaimed Capote actor who succumbed to a heroin relapse in 2014 at the age of 46.\n\nThis signifies O’Donnell’s first public relationship since Hoffman’s passing. The Daily Mail reached out to Louis C.K.’s representatives for a statement but has not yet received a response.\n\nIt marks her first public romance since Hoffman’s death. The Daily Mail has contacted representatives for Louis C.K. for comment and has yet to hear back.\n\nO’Donnell declined to comment to the Daily Mail. \n\nC.K., born Louis Alfred Székely, was previously married to Alix Bailey and has two daughters. \n\nHe has also been linked to Fiona Apple, Sarah Silverman, Blanche Gardin, and Dasha Nekrasova.\n\nC.K. became one of the first high-profile figures swept up in the #MeToo movement in 2017, when five women accused him of exposing himself and masturbating in front of them in nonconsensual and often bizarre circumstances. \n\nHe admitted the allegations were true the next day, saying: ‘These stories are true,’ and apologized. \n\nHollywood quickly cut ties, pulling him from projects and replacing him in roles that had already been filmed.\n\nSome comedians, including Chris Rock and Sarah Silverman, defended his right to return to the stage. \n\nOthers, including Judd Apatow and Rose Byrne, said it was too soon. \n\nC.K. launched a comeback in 2019 and has been steadily rebuilding his stand-up career since.\n\nHe has a string of sold-out shows for his current Ridiculous tour with two shows at New York’s Beacon Theatre tomorrow and Wednesday.\n\nHe then heads to California for nine stand-up gigs before ringing in the New year back in Brooklyn at Kings Theatre. \n\nO’Donnell, who lives in a multimillion-dollar West Village home, recently made headlines as an early supporter of New York City’s new Democratic Socialist mayor Zohran Mamdani. \n\nShe appeared in one of his first TV ads in April, jumping up and down beside the then-candidate while holding a campaign sign.\n\n‘I love a progressive candidate. He’s got the energy. I love free child care, free buses,’ she told the New York Post. \n\nThe father of O’Donnell’s three children, Hoffman, died of an accidental drug overdose in his Manhattan apartment in February 2014, at the age of 46.\n\nHoffman’s struggle with addiction stretched back to his early 20s, though few in Hollywood ever knew the full story. \n\nThe actor quietly got sober after graduating from NYU’s drama school in 1989 and stayed clean for more than 20 years, keeping his past heroin use so private that even close colleagues were unaware of the severity of his early battles.\n\nBut he secretly relapsed in 2012, beginning with prescription opioids before sliding back into heroin. \n\nFriends later said his habit escalated at alarming speed, with the Oscar winner allegedly spending up to $10,000 a month on drugs in the year before his death. \n\nHoffman even checked himself into a detox facility for just ten days in May 2013, a short stay that those close to him saw as a worrying sign he wasn’t confronting the relapse.\n\nThe addiction eventually fractured his long-term relationship with O’Donnell. \n\nShe separated from Hoffman months before his death because he wasn’t addressing his drug use, though the two continued co-parenting their three children.\n\nO’Donnell later described watching the relapse as ‘like witnessing a drowning in slow motion,’ saying she hoped the distance would force him to seek help.\n\nThe talented actor who won a Best Actor Oscar for his work in Capote was found dead on the bathroom floor of his $10,000-a-month West Village apartment. \n\nPolice discovered 70 bags of heroin and 20 used needles inside.\n\nHoffman’s drug habit allegedly saw a preferred narcotics were heroin and the prescription drug OxyContin. \n\nFriends said O’Donnell had separated from him in the months leading up to his death as his addiction spiraled. \n\nThey shared three children: son Cooper, now 22, and daughters Tallulah, 18, and Willa, 16. \n\nHe checked into a rehab center for just 10 days in May 2013, but his drug use had escalated before his death.\n\nThe actor won an Academy Award for Capote (2005) and earned further acclaim for Doubt (2008), The Master (2012), and the cult classic, The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999). \n\nHis final completed film, A Most Wanted Man, a spy thriller, was released after his passing in 2014.",

        "text": "A group of liberal senators, dissatisfied with Chuck Schumer’s leadership, has banded together to form a “Fight Club” ahead of the pivotal midterm elections. Their goal is to challenge the party’s continued support for establishment candidates.\n\nThe discontent stems from Schumer’s refusal to back Zohran Mamdani, a fresh face in politics, for New York City mayor, which has stirred frustration among these senators.\n\nThis newly formed group has already started strategizing against Schumer, according to insiders. Their rebellion became apparent following a meeting in the Oval Office, which some insiders describe as a shrewd maneuver by President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump’s unexpectedly cordial meeting with New York City’s mayor-elect last week was much warmer than anticipated, especially given their previous tensions.\n\nA seasoned Republican operative present at the meeting described it as a strategic move, likening it to a political grenade aimed at causing disruption within the Democratic Party.\n\n“Honestly, this could ignite the internal conflict among the Democrats,” the source revealed to Julia Manchester of The Hill. “It might push the Democrats to fully support Mamdani and his platform.”\n\nThe ‘political grenade’ may have already exploded, as the ‘guerrilla group’ is now planning to challenge Schumer during primaries for the 2026 midterms, particularly in Maine, Michigan and Minnesota.\n\n‘I can think of no historical example that would compare to this level of internal caucus fear and dissension,’ Josh Orton, a Democratic strategist, told The New York Times. \n\n‘To be essentially a guerrilla group of senators who are raising concerns not just about one bill or one decision, but questions of leadership’s entire disposition toward politics and the Trump administration, feels unique. \n\nThe liberal group includes longtime progressive faces Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, as well as Chris Van Hollen, Tina Smith and Chris Murphy, the Times reported. \n\nWhile many of them lean closer to Sanders’ brand of democratic socialism, reports suggest they want to the party to put up more of a fight against Trump, even referring to their meetings as ‘Fight Club’ in a reference to the 1999 film. \n\nA spokesperson for Schumer denied any favoritism or complacency with candidates, claiming they only have one goal. \n\n‘Our North Star is winning the Senate majority in 2026 and any decision is made to achieve that goal,’ the rep said.\n\nThe senators aren’t alone in their frustration with Schumer, as progressive members of the House have also been critical in the wake of the shutdown failure. \n\nRo Khanna, a California progressive, told Politico: ‘The question is what is the future of Democratic leadership. Who is going to be effective? And most Democrats around the country just don’t think that person is Chuck Schumer.’\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the most famous members of Congress and someone who many think could challenge Schumer for his Senate seat in 2028, was similarly critical. \n\n‘The Democratic Party cannot last much longer by denying the future, by trying to undercut our young, by trying to undercut a next generation of diverse and upcoming Democrats that the actual electorate and voters support,’ she said. \n\nThe rebel Democrats aren’t the only ones who see Schumer, who has led the party in the Senate since 2017, as weakened following the shutdown.\n\nTrump openly bragged that Republicans ‘broke’ Schumer during brutal negotiations to end the longest government in US history. \n\n‘I think he made a mistake in going too far,’ Trump told Fox News about the standoff in negotiations. ‘He thought he could break the Republicans and the Republicans broke him.’ \n\nThe US Senate voted to end the record-setting government shutdown by a 60-40 tally after a number of Democrats defected. \n\nThe seven Democrats and one Independent who caucused with the GOP were: Dick Durbin of Illinois, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Jacky Rosen of Nevada and Angus King (I) of Maine. \n\nNone of the members have been a part of any of these ‘Fight Club’ meetings with their fellow senators. \n\nAfter weeks of negotiations, the moderate Senate Democrats agreed to reopen the government without a guaranteed extension of health care subsidies, angering many in their caucus who have demanded that Republicans negotiate with them on the Affordable Care Act tax credits that expire January 1. \n\nThune promised a mid-December vote on the subsidies, but there was no guarantee of success. \n\nIn a possible preview, the Senate voted 47-53 along party lines Monday not to extend the subsidies for a year. Majority Republicans allowed the vote as part of a separate deal with Democrats to speed up votes and send the legislation to the House.\n\nThe president said Schumer’s status as a major party broker had withered as the lengthy shutdown dragged his beleaguered party into the abyss. \n\n‘I’ve never seen a politician change so much,’ Trump admitted. ‘He was a pretty talented guy. He’s lost his talent.’\n\nHe accused Schumer of having ‘Trump derangement syndrome’ and said the Democrat Party had been taken over by ‘crazed lunatics.’\n\nProgressive groups MoveOn and Our Revolution have also demanded that Schumer be removed as leader, citing liberal victories in off-year elections in early November showing a willingness for the public to wait out the shutdown.\n\n‘Americans showed a growing surge of support for Democrats who fought back – both at the ballot box last week and peacefully in the streets last month. Inexplicably, some Senate Democrats, under Leader Schumer’s watch, decided to surrender,’ said Katie Bethell, MoveOn’s political action executive director\n\n‘It is time for Senator Schumer to step aside.’\n\nWhile most Democrats have trashed the deal, some liberals have stepped up to back Schumer to continue.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries claimed that ‘the overwhelming majority of Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, have waged a valiant fight over the last seven weeks, defeating the partisan Republican spending bill 14 or 15 different times, week after week after week.’ \n\nWhen asked if Schumer was effective as leader and should keep his job, Jeffries answered: ‘Yes and yes.’ \n\nMSNBC commentator Rachel Maddow also defended Schumer but with faint praise, suggesting that there were no Democrats who could do any better. \n\n‘There’s nobody who is stepping up to take that job right now,’ Maddow admitted.\n\n‘There is no more wasted breath at this particular moment in our governing than the question of Chuck Schumer’s future. He has the vote of every Democratic member of the Senate. He will continue to have that,’ added fellow MSNBC anchor Lawrence O’Donnell. \n\nSchumer, in a speech to the Senate on Monday, said that Democrats succeeded in putting healthcare ‘at the forefront of people’s minds.’\n\n‘The American people will not forget Donald Trump’s cruelty and heartlessness over the past six weeks,’ he added.\n\nJon Cowan, president of the centrist think tank Third Way, said in an interview that the attacks on Schumer coming from the left will likely subside.\n\n‘Every Democrat and allied interest group is going to end their circular firing squad and aim all of their ammunition at Trump’ and at congressional Republicans who are vulnerable to losing their seats in next year’s elections, he said. \n\nSchumer, who has held his seat since 1999, is up for re-election again in 2028.",

        "text": "Top O' the Briefing\n\nHappy Tuesday, dear Kruiser Morning Briefing friends. Selenrecj and the Bouillabaisse Truck will be arriving at 7 AM to offer his wild reimagining of breakfast burritos. \n\nLast Friday, I kicked off the Briefing by asserting that we should just let the Democrats keep tripping all over themselves. I don't sweat politics as much as I used to because the post-Biden Dems are a real Keystone Cops kind of outfit. They have no concept of \"too far,\" especially when it comes to their unhinged hatred of President Trump. \n\nWhile enjoying a little publicity bump after some of the elections earlier this month (which I also didn't sweat), a few Democratic members of Congress decided to step in it by recording a video telling members of the military to ignore orders from President Trump. Trump Derangement Syndrome symptoms have always had a hint of sedition in them, so that was nothing new. It's just the latest proof that the Democrats in the upper echelon of the party are all mentally unwell. \n\nThere's a lot of you-know-what-covering going on right now over the video. As my Townhall colleague Amy Curtis writes, the \"narrative is falling apart at the seams.\" \n\nMichigan Senator Elissa Slotkin in one of the Democrats in the video, and she's struggling in her attempts to put the cat back in the bag. This is from Matt:\n\nAs PJ Media previously reported, Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and a group of Democratic lawmakers recently released a video telling military and intelligence personnel to refuse \"illegal orders\" from President Donald Trump’s administration. They didn’t mention Trump, but the implication was clear.This sparked a fierce backlash, with Trump accusing them of “sedition at the highest level” and saying their actions are punishable by death. The situation quickly escalated into a heated political firestorm with the pearl-clutching we’ve come to expect daily from Democrats every time Trump says or does something.But then Slotkin backed off.On ABC’s This Week, she admitted that she was “not aware” of any illegal orders coming from Trump.\n\nOddly, as Matt notes, ABC's Martha Raddatz kept the heat on Slotkin, and the senator didn't handle it well. I'm focusing on her today because she's a textbook example of how easily Democrats will lie about anything. \n\nI spend a lot of time with family in Ann Arbor and I was back there last year for the two months leading up to the election. The television was on a lot and nobody was muting the incessant campaign ads, so I got to see a lot of Elissa Slotkin's commercials. She pretty much ran as a moderate Republican, which Democrats often do when they're running for office in states that are still a bit purple. Yeah, some people still fall for that. \n\nWhen Slotkin was first sworn into the Senate earlier this year, she was one of the few Democrats who was acknowledging that they struggled last year because the party had gone too far to the left on some issues. She was one of only two Democrats to refrain from voting last March on a bill to ban transgender males from competing in women's sports. True, she didn't vote with the Republicans, but she also didn't join her party when they wanted to make a statement. \n\nThe 2025 Democrats are, as we're all aware, the Borg now. Everyone must be assimilated, and that's why we see Elissa Slotkin tacking hard left these days. She'll probably be hosting drag queen bingo at elementary schools in the new year. \n\nNo matter how sincere a Democrat new to Washington is about not becoming a whacked-out, TDS lefty, it's not going to last. The party has lurched too far to the left now. Even if it course-corrects, what they consider the center right now would have been Fidel Castro Land a decade ago. Zohran Mamdani isn't a drop in the commie bucket for them, he's the beginning of a flood. \n\nElissa Slotkin is falling all over her words now because words are sloppy and have no meaning in the mouths of Democrats. She's merely a perfect example of how far afield they've wandered. \n\nIt's a good thing to remember the next time any Dem in Congress starts squawking about bipartisanship.\n\nContributions to the Mailbag of Magnificence can be sent to [email protected]\n\nClick the button below to get the Morning Briefing emailed to you every weekday.

        "text": "“I have facts. They have opinions.”\n\nThat’s how Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent answered me when I asked him why he seems to have such an easy time dismantling the arguments of establishment media reporters. I shared with him my theory that he is able to calmly embarrass anti-Trump journos because he honed his skills debating Yale students while he was a professor. He didn’t reject my suggestion (he had nothing but kind words for his students), instead offering the aforementioned response. \n\nHe has facts, and they have opinions.\n\nIt’s quite simple, when you put it that way.\n\nWATCH the full interview:\n\nAnd through the first year of the Trump administration, Bessent, the avatar of MAGAnomics has certainly had the facts. He stood up to seemingly everyone in the elite consensus (aside from President Trump himself and the writers of the Breitbart Business Digest) and said that not only can we win trade wars with zero new inflation, but countries will be begging us to cut new deals.\n\nMy colleague John Carney and I got his thoughts on this and more than a dozen other topics in a 45-minute sit-down interview in the historic “Cash Room” at the Treasury Department adjacent to the White House. \n\nThe full interview is today’s episode of The Alex Marlow Show podcast with additional exclusive commentary in today’s Breitbart Business Digest. \n\nThe conversation began with a brief tour of Bessent’s past, where his anti-establishment mindset enabled him to conquer Wall Street (he’s worth more than half-a-billion dollars). “I’ve made money betting against elite consensus,” he said. \n\nHe told us that he specifically modeled his investment career on people who are not only contrarians, but are willing to change their minds. This was quite refreshing in what feels like an increasingly tribal political moment.\n\n“Policy is personnel. And when I saw what President Trump was doing, one of my biggest single trading game days was the 2016 victory,” he said.\n\nHe also identified that Donald Trump was going to become president, twice. \n\n“I thought I would be a good match to be President Trump’s Treasury Secretary,” he told us, “or just to be part of his administration.” \n\n“So, I went to him,” he continued, “almost three years ago now, and said, ‘Sir, I think you’re going to win. I think it’s going to be transformational, and I would like to be part of the economics team.’”\n\nBut Bessent was becoming MAGA many years earlier.\n\nHe described attending a Hillary Clinton fundraiser ahead of the 2016 election because he “wanted to go and sit in the room and hear what they had to say. And I walked out of that meeting, and I said, they’re going to lose.”\n\n“That was the best research money I ever spent,” he added. \n\nHillary Clinton wasn’t the only person he shaded during the event. I asked him to contrast himself with Jeffrey Epstein collaborator and arch-Democrat establishmentarian Larry Summers, to which Bessent said, “You always got to look and see what Larry’s motives are and who’s paying him,” noting that Summers has a “fascination with one of the biggest Chinese propagandists in the world.”\n\nSummers was the president of Harvard, the treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, and director of the National Economic Council under Barack Obama. He also sought seduction advice from Epstein after the convicted sex offender was busted for child sex trafficking. \n\nIn the second half of the interview, we focused on policy and strategy. Bessent detailed how the Trump administration applies maximum pressure to win trade negotiations and how rival nations routinely thank them for the new deal terms. Naturally, he heaped praise on President Trump’s dealmaking acumen.\n\nThe conversation then turned to inflation. The Treasury Secretary walked through “the three ‘i’s that are eviscerating working Americans”: immigration, interest rates, and inflation. He shared that he believed inflation will come down substantially in 2026 and teased a forthcoming study from the Council of Economic Advisers that shows that inflation in red states is 50 or 60 basis points lower than blue states.\n\nA deep discussion of rare earths followed, during which Bessent described the administration’s goal of “de-risking” from China, as opposed to “decoupling.” He touted the fact that rare earth magnets are being made in the United States for the first time in 25 years and that this new industry is likely to generate thousands of new jobs.\n\nBut that’s not the only industry where China’s hold on our supply chain gives him concern.\n\n“We got a problem with pharmaceuticals. We got a problem with semiconductors, steel, ship building. Those are strategic,” he said. “We don’t need to decouple from China. We just have to de-risk. And no one was willing to de risk because it’s hard. It’s not easy, but President Trump has told the pharmaceutical companies, you’re bringing the production here.”\n\nElsewhere in the conversation, the Secretary describes how the national security aspects of his job are amongst the most time-consuming. He also offered advice for Zohran Mamdani (even though “he knows everything”) and explained how the Trump administration views deregulation as the centerpiece of their economic agenda.\n\nThe interview ended on a positive note, with some kind words from the Treasury Secretary: “Congratulations. You both get A’s for your early analysis.”\n\nThe full interview is available now on The Alex Marlow Show feed on YouTube, Apple, Rumble, and Spotify. \n\nLook for more clips and analysis at Breitbart.com and in the Breitbart Business Digest.",

He was then rushed to a local hospital and pronounced deceased.\n\nPhotos from the scene show what appears to be a large pocketknife, blood stains on the pavement, and bloody cloths:\n\nAccording to Pix 11, a motive in the case was unclear. It was the second homicide in that area over the past few days.\n\n“On Sunday, 39-year-old Gibson Winters was fatally shot near West 46th Street and Twelfth Avenue at around 4:15 a.m., cops said. Winters was shot in the back and groin and died at the hospital. There have been no arrests in either case,” the outlet said.\n\nNow, authorities are searching for the three men suspected in the Monday incident. Sources told the Post one was wearing a purple sweater and black ski mask, and another was wearing a black jacket, dark colored pants, and brown boots. The third person was wearing black clothes.\n\nIn May 2024, a man was accused of stabbing a tourist near Times Square and in a separate case, another man was the target of a machete attack in the same area, per Breitbart News.\n\nThe news came as New York City Police Department (NYPD) officers also reportedly endured a 63-percent rise in assaults against them over the past six years.\n\nPrior to winning the New York City mayoral race, socialist Zohran Mamdani seemed to suggest he wanted “mental health experts” to lead in responding to certain crises, Breitbart News reported in October.",

I couldn’t believe that as a Republican, he would … could live with himself and the Republicans could live with him as the person who elected Zohran, which is exactly what happened.”\n\n“If he had dropped out, I would have won, I’m convinced,” Cuomo added. “Because I would have gotten that seven, I would’ve been about a point from Zohran, but it would have changed the whole dynamic.”\n\nCuomo continued to accuse Sliwa of being out there “with the clown show,” spending more time criticizing Cuomo than Mamdani. Referencing how Paterson said the radio station was receiving calls from Sliwa’s relatives, claiming Sliwa had not received equal time, Cuomo pointed out that WABC and radio host Sid Rosenberg “made Sliwa” and “gave him tremendous coverage.”\n\n“Again, talking about election coverage — nobody ever mentioned that Sliwa has been a total fraud for decades,” Cuomo said. “I think Sid Rosenberg was still in Florida when it turned out that the Guardian Angels and Sliwa made up a whole raft of stories of rescues that they did, that turned out not to be true — that Sliwa said he was kidnapped by the New York Police Department and held, and then admitted that wasn’t true.”\n\nCuomo added, “I believe he cost me the election,” and stated that if Sliwa had not run, he would have won the election.\n\nCuomo’s comments come after Mamdani, a democratic socialist, won the city’s mayoral election over his opponents. Breitbart News reported that Mamdani’s win came after “consistent polling” showed him leading in the election.\n\nAccording to CNN, Mamdani received 50.4 percent of the vote, while Cuomo received 41.6 percent of the vote. Sliwa received 7.1 percent of the vote.\n\nPrior to the mayoral election, Sliwa was reported to have melted down during an interview with 77 WABC after he was warned by Rosenberg that he would lose the election.\n\n“So far, you’ve been on this show for eight minutes, and all you’ve talked about is Cuomo,” Rosenberg said at the time to Sliwa. “And, I know you hate him, and I’m going to be honest with you, Curtis — because we’ve been friends for a long time — I don’t feel like you’re running against Mamdani anymore.”",

        "text": "Millennials moved to cities in droves during the 2000s and 2010s, drawn by the restaurants, the nightlife, and the high-paying jobs. Urban planners and local leaders celebrated, embracing what became known as the “creative class” theory — the idea that attracting educated, creative workers would drive cities’ economic growth.\nReal estate developers built accordingly, constructing apartment buildings filled with studios, one-bedrooms, and two-bedrooms designed for singles, roommates, and childless couples. Young professionals could afford the rent, and investors got steady returns. Building larger apartments for families felt risky when the smaller units were working so well. As for single-family homes or townhouses, the types of housing that families with children typically seek out — well, cities weren’t building those either.\n\nKey takeaways:\n- Cities attracted millennials in their 20s but are losing them in their 30s as they start families — and Gen Z, a smaller generation, won’t fill the gap.\n- Families leave cities during their peak earning years in part because there aren’t enough homes that fit their growing needs, which makes cities even less family friendly and hurts the local economy. \n- Demographic decline, economic pressures, and even the real estate industry signal to city leaders that ignoring families is no longer sustainable.\n\nThe strategy worked — until millennials aged out of it. As they now enter their 30s and 40s and start having children, they’re ditching cities where the housing stock never caught up to their changing needs. Across the nation, large urban counties lost roughly 8 percent of their under-5 population between 2020 and 2024, according to data from the Economic Innovation Group. In New York City, families with children under 6 have left at twice the rate of everyone else, a trend that became central to incoming mayor Zohran Mamdani’s winning affordability campaign.\nWhen families leave, cities lose far more than tax revenue; they lose their highest earners, biggest spenders, and the next generation of workers. Because Gen Z is a smaller generation, and the rise of remote work means there’s less pressure for them to live in expensive cities to access high-paying jobs, they aren’t going to fill the gap left by millennial families. \nThe creative class theory wasn’t wholly wrong, but it missed that cities need to retain those people through their peak earning years, which happen to coincide with when they have children. And as baby boomers retire, working parents become even more critical to a city’s economic strength.\nIf cities hope to remain economically healthy, they’ll need to build more housing for families with kids. \nWhy cities haven’t been building for families\nSeveral forces have worked against family-friendly development. Homeowners increasingly tend to be older and past their child-rearing years and often oppose changing zoning laws to allow more housing in their neighborhoods. Worried that the increased density could hurt their property values or quality of life, these more affluent, politically engaged residents tend to wield their outsized influence to keep newcomers out. \nAs a result, American cities are overwhelmingly zoned for single-family housing, leaving little room for the kinds of duplexes, townhouses, and smaller apartment buildings that offer young families an affordable middle ground between cramped apartments and expensive homes.\nThere is also resistance to certain kinds of families moving in. “I’m sorry, but class and race matter in America,” said Mildred Warner, a professor of city and regional planning at Cornell University. Put differently, many cities have used exclusionary zoning over the years to keep out Black and low-income families. \nUpending these historic patterns will require policy changes beyond just fixing zoning codes. Ending parking minimums — which force developers to build a certain number of costly parking spaces per unit — would make it cheaper to construct family-sized apartments. Allowing single-stair buildings up to four stories — rather than requiring two staircases — would free up space for larger, more flexible floor plans better suited to families. Making it easier to approve smaller buildings (those under 50 units) would let developers experiment with different housing types.\nAnother option is to pass laws requiring developers to include more family-sized units, like three- or four-bedroom apartments, though real estate experts warn that such a prescriptive approach could backfire.\nAn alternative idea, proposed by the Institute of Family Studies (IFS) this year, is to change how governments measure the success of their affordable housing programs. Right now, funds that finance apartments at public expense focus on maximizing the number of units built. IFS researchers suggest they should instead prioritize the number of bedrooms and the number of people housed in order to incentivize family-sized apartments. \nA professional culture problem exists, too. Many planners simply don’t consider designing urban communities for families to be part of their job. Michael Huling, a senior county planner in Clark County, Nevada, traces the issue back to dynamics from the 1960s and 1970s, an era when people were flocking en masse to suburbs. Limits on density, rules on how far houses must be from streets, and onerous parking regulations all contributed to a development culture that treated families as a suburban concern, not an urban one.\n“A lot of those anachronistic development patterns and development priorities are still lingering today and we’re still stuck with them,” he told Vox.\nStill, there’s a structural problem that goes deeper than zoning and building codes, or even professional norms. Kids don’t pay taxes, but they do absorb plenty of government services, and cities crave population growth without the associated costs of funding it.\nThe economic reality is harsh and unevenly distributed. Public support for seniors can be up to three times higher than for children, but the federal government provides the vast majority of senior aid while covering less than a third of child subsidies. Instead, state and local governments bear the bulk of K-12 education costs, creating a negative incentive for cities to welcome families with school-age children.\nWarner has found that many politicians restrict family housing, because they don’t want to pay for the schools those children would attend. Because schools are funded largely through local property taxes, cities treat school spending as a direct burden on local budgets while ignoring that businesses benefit enormously from having its future workforce educated nearby. They “ignor[e] the increasing importance of human capital investment as a critical economic development strategy,” she wrote.\nRobert Verbruggen, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, put it bluntly. “Kids don’t pay for themselves while they’re still kids,” he told Vox. “They pay for themselves later when they grow up and get jobs.”\nHis advice for mayors is pragmatic: If you want a thriving city, you need growth and more people paying taxes. Welcome families now and “you have a built-in fan base of the next generation of kids who grew up there and are already familiar with city life.”\nA belated recognition of the consequences\nIn addition to city planners, more elected leaders are beginning to recognize the crisis of housing in their cities. They’re right to, given the compounding challenges their cities face if the crisis continues pushing families to leave. If people in their early-to-mid-30s leave cities right when they’re becoming most productive and experienced in their careers, then they take their mentorship skills and institutional knowledge with them. Cities tend to end up with extremes at both ends: lower-income residents and very wealthy residents in luxury housing, but fewer middle and upper-middle class families.\nOnce families leave, cities are left with fewer vocal advocates pushing for better schools, parks, and transit, making the areas even less attractive to the next generation of parents. And as stressful as more kids in schools might be to finance, in the long run, declining school enrollment (fueled in part by more people leaving cities) and fewer children born mean even fewer taxpayers and less consumer spending. \nIndeed, declining birth rates are another problem. Recent research has found clear links between housing costs, housing size, and birth patterns. Not only is a lack of suitable housing steering families out of cities, it’s contributing to some people choosing not to have kids at all. \nThe Institute for Family Studies found that housing costs limit childbearing goals more than any other factor, including undesired singleness, preference for leisure, schooling, child care costs, and student debt. Housing costs can lead to living with one’s parents for longer, and that has a huge negative effect on fertility.\nAnother study published this month by an economist at the University of Toronto estimated that rising housing costs in the US since 1990 have led to 11 percent fewer children being born and building more two- and three-bedroom apartments could more than double the impact on birth rates compared to building more one-bedroom units. \nIdeas to stem the bleeding\nThese and other changes are forcing the real estate industry to shift. Some institutional buyers — the investors who purchase apartment buildings to operate as rentals — are starting to reject studio and one-bedroom heavy buildings, worried that tenants will keep moving out after short stays, driving up their operating expenses. And construction financing challenges driven by tariffs and high interest rates have created new openness among developers to rethink their more conservative approaches. The “built-to-rent” boom has also demonstrated to investors that families with kids will, in fact, rent homes. \nOne developer is advocating for a range of other solutions. Bobby Fijan is one of the country’s most vocal critics of his industry’s inertia. He started the American Housing Corporation to build family-sized row homes, with the first one set to open in Austin in December. Eventually, Fijan wants to expand into apartments.\nHe’s pushing other ideas, too. In a study published in September, Fijan and IFS senior fellow Lyman Stone surveyed over 6,000 Americans about their housing preferences. When shown apartments of the same square footage but different bedroom configurations, many people preferred layouts with more rooms, even if they don’t currently have children.\nOne model emerged as particularly promising: the one bedroom plus a den. Dens, which often have no windows or closet, are commonly used for an office, a TV room, or nursery. Fifty-seven percent of childless-by-choice people preferred this layout over a standard one-bedroom of the same total size, as did 54 percent of people who say they’d one day want kids. \nFor the real estate industry, the IFS pitch is straightforward. Since developers are already building apartments at 750 to 1,100 square feet, adding one more wall to divide the space could create units that appeal to a broader market. And because families with kids stay in apartments longer than singles, lower turnover could translate to lower operating costs.\nIf cities can keep couples expecting their first child even a half decade or so longer, they might begin to address the problems Warner and others have warned about. More families staying means more of the high earners and high spenders who drive local growth.\nBut Warner is skeptical of the bedroom-plus-den plan, which puts a ceiling on family size. People “like to stay where they are,” she said, and with that arrangement, you’d probably relocate as your family grows. It could accommodate babies and toddlers, but would be less ideal for teenagers who want real bedrooms with doors and windows (and parents of teenagers who’d want that, too). She’d rather see cities build actual two- and three-bedroom units — a return to how cities used to build before developers shifted to smaller apartments. \nFijan and Stone don’t disagree but see their proposal as a way to work within existing constraints. Their hope is that keeping families in cities through their children’s early years could create ongoing political pressure for the deeper changes needed to truly fix the problem.\n\nWill the “abundance” movement embrace families?\nThe growing “abundance” movement argues that removing regulatory barriers to housing and energy — for instance, cutting zoning restrictions and speeding up permitting — is key to economic growth. But making cities family friendly often requires direct government spending on schools, child care, parks, and transit. That’s a harder sell for a movement built around deregulation, not public spending. \nAt the national abundance conference this past fall, Leah Libresco Sargeant, of the Niskanen Center, tried to find a more palatable way to bring her movement on board with new family investments. She argued that the upfront costs of having children prevent families from forming, similar to how high housing costs prevent cities from growing. Baby bonuses and reducing barriers to family-friendly housing, she pointed out, could address both obstacles.\nBobby Fijan welcomes the support from abundance but remains cautious. “I genuinely think that families need to be the goal and not a byproduct” for policymakers, he told Vox.\nFijan believes the abundance movement, which skews younger, may grow into prioritizing families more as its members age. On the political right, he worries that Republican distrust of Democratic-controlled cities could also complicate support for urban family investments. But he remains optimistic, since millions of people want and need to live in cities.\n\nIn the end, housing alone won’t keep families from leaving cities. Cities still need to address public safety concerns, improve schools, and fix basic infrastructure like broken sidewalks and unreliable buses. That will require substantial investments in education, transit, and child care, not just removing regulatory barriers. It will mean challenging homeowners who benefit from the status quo and making spending choices that might not pay off for years.\nThe cities that figure out how to keep their families will thrive. For local leaders watching parents flee and school enrollments drop, these are fights worth having.\nThis story was supported by a grant from Arnold Ventures.

        "text": "Voters want stuff to be cheaper.\nTo most economists, the best way to make things more affordable is to make them more plentiful: When the supply of a good rises, its price tends to fall. Thus, to push down the costs of expensive commodities, the government should make them easier to produce. \nFor example, zoning restrictions make it illegal to build apartment towers in many urban centers. This reduces the supply of housing, which leads to higher rents. Therefore, economists argue that the government should make housing more affordable by legalizing the construction of multifamily buildings.\nBut voters don’t love this answer. After all, it asks them to accept some immediate costs (construction noise, for example) for hypothetical future benefits. More critically, supply-side reforms do little to address their affordability concerns today. When a city council votes to upzone a neighborhood, a dozen condo towers don’t promptly sprout up through the concrete. \nSo, some politicians have recently gravitated towards a simpler solution to high prices: Make prices above a certain threshold illegal.\nIn New York City, mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani campaigned on a promise to “freeze the rent” on rent-stabilized apartments. In New Jersey, the incoming Democratic governor, Mikie Sherrill, vowed to cap electricity rates.\nEconomists consider such price controls counterproductive in most markets because they discourage investment, thereby reducing affordability in the long run. Yet some of the Democratic Party’s leading economic thinkers are warming to them — sort of.\nCan voters have a little bad economic policy, as a treat?\nIn a New York Times op-ed last week, former Biden administration official Bharat Ramamurti and economist Neale Mahoney argue that price controls tend to be economically corrosive, but that Democrats should embrace them, anyway.\nTheir case is primarily political. In their telling, “voters are demanding short-term price relief” and “price controls may be the only viable way to provide it.” Ramamurti and Mahoney acknowledge that price caps have often backfired historically, leading to lower production and less affordability in the long run. But they contend that policymakers can largely avoid these pitfalls by making their price controls temporary. Essentially, they suggest that the government should increase the supply of energy and housing through public investment and regulatory reform — but, while we’re waiting for those new houses and power plants to come online, it should tide consumers over with price controls. \nI think this argument is largely misguided, for four chief reasons:\n* The economic costs of most price controls are quite large.\n* Price controls are rarely the best way to address affordability concerns, even in the short-term.\n* Letting a “temporary” price control expire is politically difficult.\n* Achieving the public’s preferred economic outcomes is more important than echoing its policy intuitions. \nMost price controls take a big toll\nThe case against price controls boils down to one simple claim: When prices move freely, they can make the economy work efficiently, to everyone’s benefit. \nIn competitive markets, rising prices are a symptom, not a disease. They signal that a good has become either more scarce or more desired: If a Labubu factory burns down, then the supply of Labubus available to consumers will shrink. If wearing a menagerie of slightly monstrous stuffed animals somehow becomes fashionable, then demand for Labubus will soar. Either way, a mismatch between how many Labubus people will want — and how many producers can provide — will emerge. If the price of Labubus is allowed to rise and fall freely, then this mismatch will become visible. \nPrice increases therefore surface critical information about supply-and-demand mismatches. And they also give both producers and consumers an incentive to mitigate those incongruities.\nWhen Labubu prices rise, producers earn higher profits, which encourages investors to direct more capital into Labubu production. Over time, that leads to more — and therefore cheaper — Labubus on the market.\nThis same dynamic holds for more vital goods, such as electricity. If a gas plant breaks down, and the power supply in an area suddenly falls, then electricity prices will rise. And that will attract investment toward new power infrastructure — solar panels, gas plants, transmission lines — which will make electricity more plentiful in the long run.\nIn the meantime, elevated prices help consumers ration scarce power efficiently. Rising rates discourage individuals from using power frivolously — such as by leaving the lights on when they’re not home — freeing up electricity for more essential uses. \nPrice controls undermine these mechanisms of economic coordination. When a city caps rents on existing housing units, it discourages investment in new residences. In fact, San Francisco’s 1994 rent control law actually reduced the supply of rental homes in the city, as many landlords converted their units into condos or commercial properties. This ultimately led to higher rents.\nLikewise, price controls can undermine efficient rationing. Gasoline was in short supply in the early 1970s. When gas prices moved freely, this led consumers to economize: People cut back on inessential trips, leaving more gasoline available to commuters. When Richard Nixon put a price cap on gas, however, scarce fuel was allocated more haphazardly. People who showed up to a station at the right time got below-market price gasoline; those who arrived a bit later got no fuel whatsoever, since the pumps had run dry.\nThis is not to say that market prices always produce efficient or socially desirable outcomes. Markets can fail in all sorts of ways. And in some eccentric sectors — where consumers have little choice, sellers have little competition, or the government drives demand — price controls can actually be beneficial. \nHealthcare may be the clearest example. The market for mastectomies isn’t much like the one for Labubus. When the price of a life-saving surgery rises, consumers don’t respond by purchasing a different, lower-cost medical procedure; people are generally willing to pay most any sum to avoid death. And in any case, most people have insurance that will cover at least some of the cost of a medically necessary operation, irrespective of its price.\nFor these reasons, allowing healthcare prices to rise won’t necessarily promote efficiency. Rather, doing so might just transfer income from patients and insurers to doctors, hospitals, and drugmakers. Putting limits on what providers can charge, therefore, makes sense and is common practice in advanced economies.\nFree markets don’t ration scarce resources justly. But neither do price controls.\nThis said, there is a natural objection to rationing scarce consumer goods through market prices: Rich people can afford to pay more for goods and services than poor people can. \nPerhaps, the argument goes, elevated prices will divert electricity from frivolous uses to essential ones. But high rates could just as easily shift kilowatts away from a working-class person’s air conditioning to a billionaire’s private ice rink.\nThis is a legitimate concern. And there are circumstances in which policymakers would be wise to impose non-market rationing systems in light of it. Amid a devastating drought, governments should ensure that all households have enough water for basic needs before allowing golf courses to keep their fairways green — even if the latter can outbid the former in the marketplace.\nNevertheless, for several reasons, price controls generally aren’t the best way to ensure a just allocation of resources amid temporary shortages.\nFirst, a price control does not actually shift scarce goods towards the least fortunate: It caps the price that everyone pays — even the rich — rather than reducing costs specifically for the disadvantaged.\nSecond, a price control often functions like a tax on the production of a good that’s already in short supply. At an intuitive level, there’s an appeal to compensating the victims of high prices by taking money from those who are charging them the exorbitant rates: When tenants are paying high rents — and landlords are making large profits — there’s some justice in redistributing from the latter to the former. \nAnd yet, if there is a housing shortage, then funding transfers to working-class tenants by taxing producers of housing — rather than rich people in general — doesn’t make much sense. Doing so effectively encourages the wealthy to invest in anything besides new housing. \nThird, since price controls tend to undermine long-term supply, their ultimate distributional implications can be complex and regressive. Rent control does not simply transfer income from landlords to tenants. Rather, it often redistributes from newer residents to long-time ones, from younger households to older ones, and — over the long run — from renters to landlords by constraining new construction and driving up market rents.\nFor all these reasons, the best way to address short-term affordability challenges is to shift purchasing power from the rich to the working class through taxes and transfers. \nRamamurti and Mahoney dismiss this option on the grounds that giving people more money to purchase housing or electricity often pushes up demand, and thus, prices.\nYet if a transfer program is properly designed, this should not be too great a concern. The affluent account for a disproportionate share of consumption. So hiking their taxes will meaningfully reduce consumer demand. If the government then targets aid at those who are most in need, then it will increase that portion of the public’s purchasing power without putting much upward pressure on prices.\n“Temporary” price controls die hard\n\nOne surprising thing\nNew York enacted rent controls as an emergency measure during the post-World War II housing crunch, yet some restrictions persist to this day.\n\nRamamurti and Mahoney are well aware of price controls’ downsides. But they suggest these costs can be mitigated by making price caps temporary. In their view, if policymakers put “sunset clauses” into their rent or utility freezes, then such measures won’t take that big a bite out of long-term investment and supply.\nYet there’s a tension in this argument. On the one hand, Ramamurti and Mahoney suggest that voters won’t tolerate politicians who oppose new price controls. On the other hand, their plan assumes that electorates will allow future politicians to let already-existing price controls expire.\nThis isn’t logically contradictory. But it seems empirically dubious. After all, voters famously exhibit status-quo bias and loss aversion — which is to say, they prioritize avoiding losses over securing gains. For this reason, they are much more likely to punish politicians for taking away existing benefits than failing to create new ones.\nIf a price control is economically disastrous and unpopular, then this dynamic won’t prevent its repeal. Nixon had little trouble phasing out his price caps once they’d yielded shortages and inflation. But Ramamurti and Mahoney clearly presume that their price controls would be valued by some constituencies. And this has certainly been true of rent control: Those who happen to live in rent-controlled units tend to appreciate the policy. For precisely this reason, however, “temporary” rent controls tend to have staying power: New York implemented rent limits as an emergency measure after World War II. Yet various rent restrictions remain on the books in NYC to this day. \nThus, if policymakers must avoid permanent price controls — as Ramamurti and Mahoney seem to believe — it’s not clear why it would be politically easier for them to do this by implementing controls and then letting them expire, rather than simply never imposing controls in the first place.\nTo be fair, I suspect Ramamurti and Mahoney have an implicit answer to this: There is an affordability crisis today, but there won’t be one tomorrow, if policymakers take various steps to expand the supply of key goods. Therefore, demand for price controls will decline over time.\nBut there are two problems with that reasoning. First, as just noted, some rent control measures enacted amid acute shortages never fully expired, even during times when housing was relatively well-supplied. \nSecond, by historical standards, life is unusually affordable for Americans today. Accounting for inflation, the median US household earned a higher income in 2024 than at any time on record. Today, prices are rising at a historically unremarkable 3 percent rate, while unemployment is relatively low. \nNone of this means that ordinary Americans should be grateful for their lot. Housing is outrageously and needlessly expensive. The rich commandeer a grossly outsize share of wealth and growth. The typical US household may be better off today than it was in the past. But it could be dramatically more comfortable, if economic policy were more efficient and egalitarian. \nMy point is simply that today’s economic problems aren’t exceptional. If they constitute an emergency that demands price caps, then future conditions are liable to constitute the same — especially since price controls tend to make life less affordable over the long term.\nWhat voters want even more than price controls\nAll of this said, there may nevertheless be contexts where embracing temporary price controls is justified on political grounds. \nRent control polls extremely well. And the issue is highly salient in some places; it seems doubtful that an opponent of rent limitations could have won New York City’s mayoral race this year. \nPoliticians can’t implement reforms that truly enhance affordability if they cannot get elected. Further, there is some evidence that tenants are more supportive of new construction when they enjoy rent protections. \nFor these reasons, it’s conceivable that some municipal politicians can best advance the cause of housing abundance by embracing narrow forms of rent control.\nBut at the national level, neither party faces a political imperative to embrace price controls. Given this, they should not enact controls that will, in practice, make most people worse off — both because doing so is bad in principle and because voters are unlikely to reward politicians who deliver unpopular economic outcomes (no matter how well their counterproductive economic policies may initially poll). \nInstead, national candidates should campaign on the broad goal of making life more affordable for ordinary Americans — then, once in power, they should pursue policies that would actually do that. \nIn the peculiar market for prescription drugs — in which companies commonly hold patent monopolies that forbid competition and the government picks up much of the bill — this would likely involve imposing some price controls. When it comes to housing and energy, by contrast, delivering greater affordability will principally require cutting red tape and increasing public investment. Meanwhile, to ensure a more just distribution of scarce resources, policymakers can increase taxes on the rich and social welfare benefits for working people.\nPerhaps, this platform would buy candidates fewer votes than across-the-board price controls. But the latter’s cost is too damn high.",

        "text": "The housing market keeps getting worse. Home prices have risen more than 50 percent since the pandemic. About a third of Americans households now spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing. In 2014, the median age of a first-time homebuyer was 31. In 2025, it was 40 — the highest on record.\n\nThe core of the problem is simple: Too much money chasing too few homes. How many more homes does America need? I've seen estimates ranging from 2 million to 5 million. It's a shortage decades in the making — and one we're nowhere near on track to solving. In 2025, America built fewer homes per 100,000 people than it did in 2005, 1995, 1985 or 1975.\n\nEvery White House since President Barack Obama's administration has recognized the need to build more homes but the results, under both Democrats and Republicans, have been anemic. Housing is a hard problem to solve from the Oval Office. Zoning and building rules are set at the state and local levels. Interest rates are set by the Federal Reserve. In 2024, Kamala Harris promised to build 3 million new homes and released a plan that no housing expert I spoke to thought could come anywhere near achieving that goal.\n\n\" The thing that I think we learned is that federal housing policy is stuck in a really weak equilibrium,\" said Jared Bernstein, who led President Joe Biden's Council of Economic Advisers. \"There is just far too little asked of cities and states. They won't do much to push back on the barriers that are blocking affordable housing.\"\n\nBernstein, who is now a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, wants to change that. He's among the authors of a new housing plan that tries to deliver the next administration a set of solutions nearer to the scale of the problem.\n\nAt the core of the center's plan is an idea it calls \"Rent Relief for Reform.\" I don't love the name, but I like the idea: Places with a housing shortage — and that's a lot of them — get a choice. Build the housing and the federal government will give all the renters in the city up to $1,000 off their rent — or don't build the housing and lose access to certain federal grants.\n\nThe Searchlight Institute, a new Democratic think tank, recently proposed a similar idea. In that version, cities and other places that hit ambitious housing targets would qualify for a federal rebate that would give every household — so both homeowners and renters — a check equal to the average increase in rent over the last year. In other words, build enough housing and the federal government will give the people who live near that housing money.\n\nBoth those ideas are trying to solve the hard problem at the heart of housing politics: It's the people who already have homes who have a voice in local politics and planning. They often like their neighborhood the way it is. They don't want more traffic or new neighbors or the hassle of nearby construction. What's in it for them?\n\n\"You can put this kind of crassly as you're incentivizing renters to show up at local elections and push their elected officials to do things that are renter-friendly, which I don't hate as a strategy,\" said Jenny Schuetz, who leads housing policy at Arnold Ventures. \"If most renters showed up in the primaries and demanded that their mayor and City Council actually do good things, we could have some pretty different outcomes. But mostly renters don't show up — particularly in the primary — and so you get these homeowner-dominated coalitions in cities that make it hard to build.\"\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nThe other problem is that even a housing policy that does benefit a community will do so slowly. It takes years to plan and build new homes. It takes time for new supply to lower costs. That time breaks the feedback loop between good policy and good politics. \" If you're a politician and you have a four-year term, you really need to do all of your housing stuff in year one if you want to have people feel the benefit within that single term,\" said Aaron Shroyer, who served as special assistant to Biden for housing policy and co-authored the Searchlight plan.\n\nSome polling Searchlight did is telling here. Seventy-nine percent of Americans say housing costs are \"too high\" or \"way too high.\" Sixty-two percent say it's become harder to find housing they can afford. But only 24 percent think building more housing in their community would lower costs. People do not believe building housing near them will benefit them. So policymakers need to create that benefit; they need to turn the indirect and slow gains of growth into something more visible and immediate for the community that is creating that growth.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nThe other big idea in the Center for American Progress plan is to change the way we build housing in America. \"If you go back to 1910, somebody showed up with a toolbox and a hammer to build a house,\" Bernstein said. \"And if you go to 2025, it's the same damn thing. This is the one sector where productivity has been literally falling for five decades while everything else has been going up.\"\n\nThe comparison that often gets made here is to manufacturing. Between 1950 and 2020, productivity in the manufacturing sector — how much you could produce with the same number of workers — rose by more than 900 percent. That's a big part of why everything from tables to televisions is cheaper today than decades ago. But over the same period, productivity in the construction sector has fallen. That's not the only reason housing is so expensive today, but it's part of it.\n\nBut you can manufacture housing — constructing homes in an off-site factory much the way we construct cars and then shipping them for final assembly. This is technology pioneered in the United States when George Romney, Mitt Romney's father, served as secretary of housing and urban development during the Nixon administration. But the United States never figured out the rules nor the financing to make an industry out of it. Instead, it's taken hold elsewhere. In Sweden, for example, more than 40 percent of new homes — and more than 80 percent of single-family homes — are fabricated off-site.\n\nThe Center for American Progress's plan proposes a slew of projects to take this industry America invented and make it one where America is a leader. They want the government to seed a major research program to fund innovation in housing construction. They want to have the federal government leverage its purchasing power to become an initial buyer for modular housing — one idea here would be to have the Department of Defense upgrade its military base housing using modular construction. They want to modernize building codes to make modular easier — removing, for instance, an outdated federal requirement to attach a permanent steel chassis to all modular construction — and updating federal insurance and financing rules to make sure modular production qualifies.\n\nYou could imagine states and cities acting even before the federal government does. \"New York was once a beacon of creative, public sector-led, affordable housing production,\" says Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's housing plan. \"But decades of disinvestment and shrinking government capacity have left us waiting on the real estate industry to solve a housing crisis from which they profit.\"\n\nLeft unsaid in his plan is that publicly subsidized, affordable housing has become monstrously expensive to construct because the public money triggers rules and process and reviews and negotiations that market-rate housing doesn't contend with. A Rand study found that, per square foot, affordable housing cost more than 1.5 times as much to build in California as market-rate housing; a Washington Post investigation revealed an affordable housing development in D.C. where the units cost $800,000 each to build, even as the same developer was building market-rate units for $350,000 next door. One reason we don't build enough affordable housing is we've made affordable housing unaffordable to build.\n\nMamdani proposed investing $100 billion to build 200,000 \"publicly subsidized, permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes\" over the next decade. That works out to $500,000 per unit — if all goes well. What if New York City became a test case for how modular construction could allow public housing, ordered and built at massive scale, in unionized factories, to become cheaper and faster to build than market-rate housing? If it was only $350,000 per unit, that would mean building almost 300,000 units for the same cost.\n\nOne problem the modular housing industry has faced is the absence of steady demand to keep the factories running and work out the kinks of construction. A place like New York City that wanted to build public housing at scale, over a long period of time, could create that steady demand and use it to seed an industry — New York could become America's leader in modular construction.\n\nPerhaps that's fanciful. But our thinking on housing — both public and private — has been far too small for far too long. We've accepted shocking cost increases paired with stagnating productivity. We've made it impossible for tens of millions of families to build the lives they want in the cities they'd ideally choose. At this point, making it possible to build more housing just isn't enough. We need to change how we build housing. I don't know if modular housing is really the answer. But it's worth trying.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.",

But the fact that these discussions are happening signals something important: The existing primary model is divisive and has served our party’s broad base poorly.\n\nA primary system driven by majority support, not fractured pluralities\n\nParty stalwarts know the challenges primary season brings—the formation of camps as activists and rank-and-file Democrats pick their candidates. It is rarely enough to simply support one’s own; people feel pressure to tear down everyone else. Few of us are immune to those dynamics, including me. We are human, after all. \n\nBut ranked voting changes that dynamic. You can no longer alienate supporters of other candidates; you need them. Candidates have to court those voters, convince them that even if their first choice is someone else, they’re still worthy of a high ranking. Obnoxious, destructive behavior serves zero purpose.\n\nAn end to outsized early-state distortions\n\nRanked choice voting fixes some long-standing distortions in the primary calendar. Iowa and New Hampshire may no longer have top billing, but there will still be early states—meaning most of us still won’t have a meaningful voice in the opening rounds. Under the current system, those early results create intense pressure for candidates to consolidate or drop out. Ranked voting weakens that incentive. It rewards broad appeal rather than whoever happens to eke out, say, 22% in the first few contests.\n\nA check against media-manufactured momentum surges\n\nBy producing clearer, majority-driven outcomes, ranked voting blunts the breathless media narratives that inflate or deflate campaigns based on tiny, unrepresentative early-state pluralities. The early-state circus becomes less important, and candidates who don’t appeal to wide swaths of the electorate can’t ride a fluke finish into weeks of free media.\n\nProtection against crowded-field chaos in 2028\n\nRanked choice voting is also a hedge against crowded fields, which we’ll certainly have in the 2028 cycle. Under the current system, someone can walk away with the lead simply because everyone else cancels each other out. Ranked voting breaks that dynamic and ensures candidates can’t prevail with narrow, factional support.\n\nA boost for candidates who actually build coalitions\n\nRanked choice voting rewards candidates who do the hard organizing work—building relationships in multiple communities, showing up for constituencies outside their ideological home turf, and proving they can win not just a slice of the party but a majority of it. \n\nEven candidates who seem to win on “vibes,” like New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, succeed because that energy rests on top of real coalition work. His campaign may have projected momentum and enthusiasm online, but underneath that was the kind of multilingual, cross-community organizing that ranked voting structurally favors. \n\nThat kind of coalition building led to one primary ad in which Mamdani and one of his opponents, Comptroller Brad Lander, endorsed each other, telling their backers to rank the other person second.\n\nPut simply, vibes help, but they don’t replace the coalition—they amplify it.\n\nHigher turnout from voters who no longer fear “wasting” their vote\n\nA lot of people skip primaries because they think their preferred candidate isn’t “viable.” Ranked choice voting eliminates that psychological penalty. Voters can safely choose their favorite and still influence the final outcome. That especially matters for younger voters, working-class voters, and voters of color—exactly the parts of the Democratic coalition that benefit from having their voices counted in full.\n\nA calmer, more unified party heading into the general election\n\nRanked voting lowers the temperature inside the party. This isn’t about being nicer for the sake of niceness; it’s about avoiding the durable bitterness that can seep into the general election. When candidates need second-choice votes, they have real incentives to avoid torching their rivals’ supporters.\n\nSpace for ideological allies to cooperate instead of cannibalize\n\nIdeological blocs can work together rather than undermine each other. Imagine a 2020 Democratic primary cycle where Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders didn’t split the left but ran as an informal one-two ticket—encouraging their supporters to rank them together, strengthening each other rather than sabotaging both of them.\n\nA system that welcomes movement candidates without creating spoilers\n\nRanked choice voting discourages spoiler narratives without discouraging participation. Movement candidates, regional candidates, and single-issue candidates can all run without getting blamed for “splitting the vote.” The system absorbs that diversity instead of letting it distort the outcome.\n\nA nominee tested across the entire Democratic coalition\n\nPerhaps most importantly, ranked choice voting produces a nominee who has been tested across the full breadth of the party—someone who has earned not just passionate first-choice supporters but broad second-choice goodwill. That’s the kind of candidate who enters the general election stronger, more grounded, and with fewer wounds to heal.\n\nRanked choice voting in primaries won’t magically heal every tension inside the Democratic Party, and it won’t guarantee a drama-free primary season. Nothing ever does. But it does offer something better than what we have now. \n\nRanked voting rewards coalition building, respects the full diversity of the Democratic electorate, and reduces the incentives to burn down half the party in the name of a fleeting advantage. It gives voters more freedom, gives campaigns better incentives, and gives the eventual nominee a stronger foundation heading into the general election.\n\nWhether the DNC ultimately embraces the change or not, these discussions are an acknowledgment that the old model has limits—and that a healthier, more representative process is out there.",

        "text": "James Carville may be best known for a single line he uttered during the 1992 presidential race when he helped Bill Clinton defeat George H.W. Bush. The line was \"It's the economy, stupid\" and it wasn't just a random thought, it was Carville's strategy for capitalizing on voter dissatisfaction with the economy.\n\nJump forward 33 years and Carville now sees that a very similar message could provide Democrats a way out of the political dungeon they've found themselves in. He's mostly looking at the recent election in which affordability seems to have trumped (no pun intended) every other issue.\n\nZohran Mamdani, Abigail Spanberger, Mikie Sherrill — even down-ballot Georgia Democrats — all won with soaring margins because the people are pissed. And the people always point their anger at the party in charge. Rent is out of control. Young people can’t afford homes or pay student debt. We’re living through the greatest economic inequality since the Roaring Twenties.President Trump has done nothing to curb the cost of what it requires to take even a breath in America today, the centerpiece promise of his 2024 campaign. The people are revolting, and they have been for some time.\n\n\"The people are revolting and they have been for some time\" is a hilarious line. In any case, Carville says the key to giving Dems a second chance is to make the midterms all about economic rage.\n\nI am now an 81-year-old man and I know that in the minds of many, I carry the torch from a so-called centrist political era. Yet it is abundantly clear even to me that the Democratic Party must now run on the most populist economic platform since the Great Depression.It is time for Democrats to embrace a sweeping, aggressive, unvarnished, unapologetic and altogether unmistakable platform of pure economic rage. This is our only way out of the abyss...Just as it was for the Mamdani campaign, raging against the rigged, screwed-up, morally bankrupt system that gave us the cost of living crisis must be the centerpiece of every Democratic campaign in America. Unless you’re the top 1 percent, this touches everybody...We have to present ourselves as adamantly, even angrily, opposing the system that is preventing younger rural voters from buying homes, jacking up utility bills and keeping grocery prices at astronomical levels. It is vital that Democrats, with some big ol’ cojones, rail against the unjust economic system that has created these conditions.\n\nIs he right? Well, affordability does seem to be the issue that is driving voters at this moment. Of course, the reason affordability isn't great in the first place is that we had record inflation during the Biden administration. That inflation was partly caused by massive overspending championed by Democrats, including one massive bill absurdly labeled the Inflation Reduction Act. (Remember when Joe Manchin became public enemy #1 for trying to limit spending?)\n\nSomeone made this slightly silly but memorable chart.\n\nAngry about affordability? Why are prices so high?Blame Joe Biden.𝐈𝐍𝐅𝐋𝐀𝐓𝐈𝐎𝐍 𝐑𝐀𝐓𝐄 𝐁𝐘 𝐏𝐑𝐄𝐒𝐈𝐃𝐄𝐍𝐓Trump 1.0 --> NO INFLATIONBiden --> RUNAWAY INFLATIONTRUMP 2.0 --> INFLATION COMES DOWN pic.twitter.com/ly9lR6HZ0R— Stephen Moore (@StephenMoore) November 14, 2025\n\nSo, yes, Carville is probably right that shrewd Democrats can escape responsibility for their own mess by suddenly becoming the champions of affordability. It's also true that the party in power usually suffers during the midterms, so they have historical precedent on their side.\n\nBut it's also true that President Trump and Republicans can fight for for affordability themselves. And they have the advantage of actually having political power to carry out their plans over the next year. If they can bring some prices down that should limit Democrats' ability to capitalize on the unhappiness with the economy they helped to create.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Hot Air's conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

He’s got the energy. I love free child care, free buses. I like all the stuff he’s said,” Hoffman’s longtime girlfriend told The Post back in April.\n\nAs for C.K., he tied the knot with actress Alix Bailey in 1995. The pair welcomed daughters Kitty, 23, and Mary Louise, 20, before their divorce in 2008 after 13 years of marriage.\n\nThe surprising photos of the comedian and Hoffman’s ex kissing come nearly eight years after several women accused C.K. of sexual misconduct in a bombshell New York Times exposé.\n\nFive women claimed that the “Lucky Louie” comic, whose real name is Louis Alfred Székely, exposed himself and masturbated in front of them without their consent.\n\nC.K. later admitted to the allegations and issued a lengthy apology in 2017.\n\n“These stories are true,” he began. “At the time, I said to myself that what I did was okay because I never showed a woman my d–k without asking first, which is also true.”\n\n“The power I had over these women is that they admired me,” C.K. added. “And I wielded that power irresponsibly.”\n\nThe comedian came under fire again more recently for performing at the Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia.",

        "text": "Joe got pulled over by a cop in Portage County, Wisconsin, and could have gotten off with a mere traffic ticket — or perhaps just a warning — but he was defiant, looking for trouble. If you’ve watched a lot of police body camera videos on YouTube (it’s a hobby of mine), you’ve become familiar with this scenario, the routine traffic stop that “escalates,” sometimes fatally. It often begins with a motorist’s refusal to give the officer a driver’s license, proceeding to the demand that the officer summon a supervisor, etc. Joe ended up in handcuffs in the back of a squad car, charged with assault and other crimes, adding to his already lengthy history of run-ins with the law.\n\nWhat causes these unnecessary confrontations? In a word, equality — or, as I’ve previously pointed out, Equality, with a capital “E,” denoting the quasi-religious faith in Equality common among liberals. “All men are created equal,” as our Declaration of Independence famously proclaimed, and that simple five-word phrase has become the foundation of a dangerous cult, which threatens to wreck the very nation that the Declaration announced our ancestors’ intent to create.\n\nEquality, as conceived by liberals, is not merely a political ideal, but a moral principle, so that any sort of inequality is to them a sort of sin. If your bank balance is even a dollar more than your neighbor’s, this is oppression — your poor neighbor is being oppressed and exploited, and you should feel guilty about it. Sins against the cult of Equality are denounced as injustice, and once someone starts viewing the world through such warped lenses, they see injustice everywhere. The rich are oppressing the poor, whites are oppressing racial minorities, men are oppressing women, so on and so forth, and the liberal will never find an end to these alleged injustices that cry out for remediation. (RELATED: The Dangerous Cult of Income Equality)\n\nIf you were fortunate enough to have studied political science under old-fashioned professors, as I did, you understand that the ideals expressed in the Declaration of Independence — “unalienable rights,” etc. — are somewhat self-contradictory. That is to say, equality and liberty are at odds with each other. People have different interests and different abilities, and, insofar as they have liberty to engage in what the Declaration calls “the pursuit of happiness,” their fortunes will vary greatly, so that they are not equal in terms of their income, wealth, and social status. To view this kind of naturally occurring inequality as proof of oppression is absurd, and yet it is on the basis of such a belief that liberals spend their lives crusading for what they think of as “social justice.”\n\nPermitted to advance unchecked, the Cult of Equality must ultimately destroy all established authority, all commerce and industry, and unleash bloody violence — e.g., the Khmer Rouge in “Year Zero” — before finally imposing absolute dictatorship.\n\nOf course, liberals deny any such intent, but the road to Hell is proverbially paved with good intentions, and liberals have become accustomed to not being confronted about their fanatical belief in Equality, by which so many evils may be justified. Given how common it is for children to be taught to revere Equality as an unquestionable good, even conservatives may hesitate to point out what’s wrong with this idea. It’s not politically popular to criticize Equality, or to defend any particular species of actual inequality, and so the liberal syllogism is permitted to avoid scrutiny of its basic premise.\n\nNew York City is preparing to inaugurate a new mayor who campaigned on a platform of wild-eyed radicalism. Zohran Mamdani has promised to freeze rents, to build thousands of “affordable housing” units at taxpayer expense, and to impose punitive taxation on the rich. Critics have pointed out the practical obstacles to Mamdani’s agenda, but the real question is why a majority of voters in New York City have bought the “democratic socialist” hokum that Mamdani is peddling. However bad the status quo in New York may be, what is the basis for the apparent belief of most New Yorkers that extreme left-wing measures are the solution to their problems? Is it just a blind hatred of the rich? (RELATED: The Mamdani Model: More Socialist Mayors to Come)\n\nHate can be a powerful force in politics, and the Cult of Equality justifies the kinds of hatred that Mamdani expresses, including his Hamas-style denunciations of Israel. Anyone can see that the Israelis are richer than their Palestinian neighbors and that, in terms of organized military power, Israel is vastly superior to any of its enemies. It is Israel’s success, contrasted to the failures of its neighbors, which has attracted the hatred of those like Mamdani who incite paranoia about a wicked Zionist conspiracy. (RELATED: The Anti-Colonial Shadow Over Mamdani’s Socialism)\n\nLet us return, now, to Joe and his traffic stop in Wisconsin. At the root of Joe’s confrontational defiance was his belief that he is equal to the cop — denying the police officer’s authority to order Joe to hand over his driver’s license. But it becomes impossible to enforce any law if the authority of duly-sworn officers is not recognized. We, as citizens, vote for legislatures that enact laws, and we elect local governments that hire police to enforce those laws. The Bill of Rights guarantees certain protections — habeas corpus, trial by jury, etc. — and with those guarantees in mind, a law-abiding citizen has no reason to fear the police, much less to take a defiant attitude toward the cop just doing his job.\n\n“You’ll have your day in court,” the supervising sergeant of the township police told Joe during the traffic stop that ended with Joe handcuffed in the back of the squad car. This was an adage among Americans for generations: “You’ll have your day in court,” meaning, basically, don’t argue with the cop, but take it up with the judge in whatever hearings or other court proceedings may follow. Some people, however, act as if police authority is an insult: “How dare this cop presume to boss me around?” To acquiesce with the officer’s orders would be to admit that the officer is in some way superior, and any kind of superiority is unacceptable to the Cult of Equality.\n\nJoe got a free ride to jail (not his first such ride) because he could not accept the reality of the officer’s lawful authority, and here, dear readers, you must excuse me for invoking a much higher authority. To put it bluntly, Joe needs Jesus, and so do we all.\n\nThe eighth chapter of Matthew’s gospel tells how, in Capernaum, a Roman centurion appealed to Jesus, “Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented”:\n\nAnd Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him. The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.\n\nJesus “marvelled” at the centurion’s expression of what it means to be “a man under authority” and, having praised the centurion for his “great faith,” said the word that accomplished his request, so that the centurion’s “servant was healed in the selfsame hour.”\n\nThese few verses are sufficient to inspire many lengthy sermons, but notice first that the centurion appealed for the healing of his own servant. A few years ago, when one of my sons was studying Hannibal’s invasion of Italy (218–204 B.C.), he remarked that historians now believe slaves constituted fully half of the population of the city of Rome at the time. Slavery was commonplace in the ancient world, and the fact that the Roman centurion had a servant was not remarkable.\n\nSecond, notice how the centurion abases himself to Jesus: “Lord, I am not worthy.” At the time, Judea was under the imperial yoke of Rome, so that an officer of the legions could expect any of the conquered Jews to show respect toward him, but this centurion was so desperate for the healing power of Jesus that he confessed his own unworthiness even to have him “come under my roof.” It was this that led the centurion to describe himself as “a man under authority,” requesting Jesus just to “speak the word” that would heal his servant, eliciting the response: “Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel…. And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee.”\n\nSet aside, for the sake of argument about more secular matters, whether the reader believes in the miracles recorded in the Bible. The point is that Christians, who do so believe, are called to emulate the example of Jesus in complying with lawful authority. Even when He was betrayed, persecuted, and crucified, Jesus did not resist. He came to serve as an atoning sacrifice, in fulfillment of prophecy, and we who call ourselves Christians are commanded to take up the cross and follow Him.\n\nThe police officer is “a man under authority.” Is that not apparent? Is further explanation needed? Why would Joe in Wisconsin, or anyone else, have a problem with the cop just doing his job? Isn’t such lawless defiance a predictable consequence of the Cult of Equality, which encourages fools to think there is no such thing as superior authority?\n\nWhen I was a boy attending Sunday School at the First Baptist Church of Lithia Springs, Georgia, obedience to authority was among the lessons most strenuously taught. It’s right there in the Ten Commandments: “Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land.” And this duty extended also to respecting civil authority, as the Apostle Paul admonished the early church in Rome: “Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God.”\n\nWe may observe that Paul was counseling those early believers to comply with “the powers that be” at a time when Christians faced persecution by Roman authority. The duty of being “subject unto the higher powers” was not contingent on whether those powers were exercised by godly men, or whether Christians suffered wrongly under the “powers that be.” Faith that everything is “ordained of God” — even our own suffering — is an obligation for all Christians, because we have the promise that one day we will have “our day in court,” at the Final Judgment, when our plea will be entered by He who healed the centurion’s servant.\n\nThe Cult of Equality is anti-Christian, both in the theological sense and in a practical sense. Paul warned the Ephesians to “put on the whole armour of God” in the struggle “against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.” In the very same chapter, however, Paul admonished children to obey their parents and servants to obey their masters. The Cult of Equality rejects traditional distinctions of authority, and the Christian church today faces no enemy more hostile than the atheistic radicalism of the Left.\n\nReal injustice and actual oppression are not so rare that they can be ignored, but the Cult of Equality conjures up imaginary victimhood — “heteronormative patriarchy,” “structural racism,” “systemic transphobia,” blah blah blah — to seduce its gullible followers into a delusional rage. Meanwhile, there are analogous delusions among the angry young men who heed a competing victimhood narrative (promoted by Nick Fuentes, among others), thinking themselves cheated out of what they deserve by Zionists and other enemies. It’s a crazy world we’re living in, where liberals claim that everybody is being oppressed by white men, while at the same time, some white men claim that they are the real victims of oppression.\n\nBack once again to that traffic stop in Wisconsin — Joe’s a white guy, and the officers arresting him were white, too. The last census found that Portage County is about 90 percent white, so there was no “racial injustice” involved in Joe getting manhandled into the back of a cop car. Joe nevertheless behaved like every BLM-inspired black suspect who decides to resist arrest because he believes his rights are being violated, turning a simple traffic stop or domestic disturbance case into a violent confrontation. Law enforcement officers risk their lives and, alas, too often lose their lives, because of the anti-police attitudes that have flourished in recent years. At the same time, calls to “defund the police” have endangered public safety, as has misguided leniency toward habitual criminals like Decarlos Brown.\n\nBy undermining law enforcement, the Cult of Equality endangers those “unalienable rights” which, in the words of the Declaration of Independence, governments are instituted to secure. When governments fail to protect the property and lives of their citizens, the result may be catastrophic — riots, anarchy, civil war. Why do you think it is, after all, that anarchist vandals in places like Seattle and Portland have made “ACAB” (All Cops Are Bastards) their most common graffiti slogan?\n\nNowhere is the Cult of Equality’s anti-law enforcement attitude more evident now than in the Left’s attempts to obstruct the Trump administration’s effort to apprehend and deport illegal aliens. Liberals have adopted such a radical egalitarian stance that they view any random foreigner as having an “equal right” to reside in the United States, no matter what the law says. Thus, the Salvadoran gangster Kilmar Garcia is described as a “Maryland man,” without regard either to his immigration status or the crimes he has committed since illegally crossing the border. Democrat politicians actively encourage attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents — calling them “Gestapo,” “Nazis,” “thugs,” etc. Why? Because somehow Democrats, in their maniacal devotion to the Cult of Equality, consider it unfair to enforce immigration law. (RELATED: The Geography of Defiance)\n\nWe are in a dangerous place, politically, when such contempt for authority is promoted by those who style themselves defenders of “Our Democracy.” It’s not just idiots getting themselves arrested because they can’t cope with a simple traffic stop. It’s members of Congress indicted for obstructing ICE agents. America itself is at risk when lawmakers become lawbreakers, but this is where the fanatical belief in Equality leads, and destruction awaits if we do not reverse course.\n\nREAD MORE from Robert Stacy McCain:\n\nDots and Patterns: What History Can Teach Us\n\nDemons and Demonization\n\nThe Historic Roots of Russiagate",

        "text": "Rioters outside Park East synagogue in New York recently chanted genocidal screeds such as “There is only one solution: intifada revolution” and “we don’t want no two states, we want all of it.”\n\nBut rather than unequivocally condemn the rabid antisemitism inherent in the protests, New York City’s mayor elect Zohran Mamdani’s office chose to not only tokenize synagogues as “sacred spaces,” but to then also condemn the synagogue and its event guest, Nefesh B’Nefesh, an organization that strives to get Jews to move to Israel, as “promot[ing] activities in violation of international law.” (RELATED: The New York Times Sets a New Low on Israel)\n\nAs I have argued before, far before fungible, fair-weathered concepts of “international law” ever existed, Jews were the indigenous people of the Land of Israel, having sovereignty or pseudo-sovereignty there during:\n\nThe Kingdom of Israel (1020 to 930 BCE);The northern Kingdom of Israel (930 BCE to 720 BCE);The southern Kingdom of Judah (930 BCE to 586 BCE);The Yehud under the Neo-Babylonian/Chaldean Empire (586 BCE-539 BCE);The Yehud Medinata under the Persian Achaemenid Empire (539 BCE to 332 BCE);The Hasmonean Dynasty under the Greek Seleucid Empire (164 BCE to 63 BCE)The Hasmonean Dynasty under the Roman Empire (63 BCE to 40 BCE);The Herodian Dynasty under the Roman Empire (37 BCE to 6 BCE);The First Jewish-Roman War (66 CE to 73 CE);The Palestinian Patriarchate under the Roman Empire (80 CE to 425 CE)Full independence from the Roman Empire as a result of the Bar Kokhba Rebellion (132 CE to 135 CE); andJewish autonomy in Jerusalem under the Persian Sasanian Empire during the Jewish revolt against Heraclius (614-617 CE).\n\nApparent in the above timeline is not only the millennia-old Jewish ties to the Land of Israel, but that the Jews regained control of it several times after losing it to colonizers: in 586 BCE under the prophets Ezra and Nehemiah (brokered with King Cyrus, who allowed the Jews to return following Persia’s defeat of the Babylonians), under the Hasmonean Dynasty (featured in the story of Hanukkah when the Jews defeated the Greeks), several times during the Roman Empire, during the Jewish revolt against Heraclius from 614-617 CE, and finally during the re-establishment of Israel in 1948.\n\nMamdani slanders Jews and Judaism, as a yearning for the Jews to return to the Land of Israel is baked into Judaism itself. In the liturgy, Jews have prayed to return to the Land of Israel since Time Immemorial. Jews conclude the Passover Seder and the Yom Kippur service (“Neilah”) with the words “Next Year in Jerusalem.” The Grace After Meals pines for the restoration of Jerusalem. (RELATED: Israel, the Church, and the Unraveling of Conservative Unity)\n\nPsalm 137:1 states that during the Babylonian Captivity, “By the Rivers of Babylonian we sat and wept when we remembered Jerusalem.” Psalm 137:5 states, “If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand lose its skill.”\n\nThe Jews’ return to the land of Israel is predicted in the Hebrew Bible. According to Deuteronomy 30:1-5,\n\nWhen all these things have happened to you, the blessings and the curses that I have set before you, if you call them to mind among all the nations where the Lord your God has driven you, and return to the Lord your God, and you and your children obey him with all your heart and with all your soul, just as I am commanding you today, then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you, gathering you again from all the peoples among whom the Lord your God has scattered you. Even if you are exiled to the ends of the world, from there the Lord your God will gather you, and from there he will bring you back. The Lord your God will bring you into the land that your ancestors possessed, and you will possess it; he will make you more prosperous and numerous than your ancestors.\n\nAnd Isaiah 11:11-12 states,\n\nAnd it shall come to pass that on that day, the Lord shall continue to apply His hand a second time to acquire the rest of His people, that will remain from Assyria and from Egypt and from Pathros and from Cush and from Elam and from Sumeria and from Hamath and from the islands of the sea. And He shall raise a banner to the nations, and He shall gather the lost of Israel, and the scattered ones of Judah He shall gather from the four corners of the earth.\n\nAnd Ezekiel 20:41-42 states, “With a pleasing savor I shall accept you when I take you out of the nations, and I shall gather you from the lands in which you were scattered, and I shall be hallowed through you before the eyes of the nations. And you will know that I am the Lord when I bring you to the land of Israel, to the land that I lifted My hand to give to your forefathers.”\n\nJeremiah 29:14 states that “And I will be found by you, says the Lord, and I will return your captivity and gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I have driven you, says the Lord, and I will return you to the place whence I exiled you.” Jeremiah 31:17 states, “There is hope for your future, says the Lord, and your children will return to their border.”\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Zion is mentioned 152 times in the Hebrew Bible and Jerusalem 669 times. Israel and Judah (as the names of land, in addition to the names of the biblical figures from whom they are named) are obviously in there, too.\n\nAnd if not because of all that, Mamdani should know that the Quran states that the land belongs to the Jews and that they will return to it.\n\nAs the prophet Isaiah stated in Isaiah 62:1, “For the sake of Zion I will not be quiet, and for the sake of Jerusalem I will not be still.” So let it be known that Mamdani defames Jews and Judaism by undermining the Jews’ inalienable right to live in (and return to) their ancestral homeland, the Land of Israel.\n\nREAD MORE from Steve Postal:\n\nWill Trump Get Saudi Arabia to Join the Abraham Accords?\n\nKazakhstan Joins the Abraham Accords.

        "text": "New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani revealed the “weirdest” thing he observed during his visit to the White House to meet President Donald Trump in an appearance on The Adam Friedland Show on Monday.\n\nWhen Friedland asked, “What was the weirdest thing he [Trump] showed you?” Mamdani said on the web-based talk show, “I sit down, waiting for the time of the meeting, and in front of me are all of these different coffee table books. And one of them is UFC at the White House. I had no idea, and I was just flippin’, flippin’ through that.”\n\nPressed on whether he would go to the White House UFC event scheduled for June 2026, Mamdani simply said, “No,” drawing a laugh from Friedland and himself.\n\n View this post on Instagram A post shared by THE ADAM FRIEDLAND SHOW (@theadamfriedlandshow)\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nThe lighthearted comments stand in stark contrast to the contentious relationship between the two politicians during the mayoral campaign. Mamdani defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary, then faced Cuomo again in the general election after he launched an independent bid alongside Republican Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani won the November 4 election with a clear majority.\n\nTrump repeatedly criticized Mamdani throughout the race, calling him a “communist lunatic” while questioning his fitness for office. The president also threatened to withhold federal funding from New York if Mamdani won.\n\nHowever, Trump appeared to completely reverse course after meeting Mamdani at the White House last week, showering the mayor-elect with glowing praise while fully endorsing him. Trump said he would feel comfortable living in Mamdani’s New York.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nDuring the interview, Friedland questioned how Mamdani maintained composure during the White House press conference, noting observers were surprised by his calm demeanor. When asked how he kept a straight face, Mamdani said he stayed focused by concentrating on his priorities for the city.\n\n“Honestly, I was just thinking about New York City,” Mamdani told Friedland.\n\nThe interview then turned to unusual elements of the White House visit. When Friedland asked about the strangest thing Mamdani encountered, the mayor-elect described his pre-meeting experience.\n\n“I sit down waiting for the time of the meeting, and in front of me are, like, all these different coffee table books, and one of them is UFC at the White House,” Mamdani said. “I had no idea, but I was just flippin’, flipping through that.”\n\nMamdani has provided additional details about his White House visit in other media appearances. During an NBC News Meet the Press interview with host Kristen Welker, he addressed the moment when reporters asked if he still considers Trump a fascist. Trump interjected that he didn’t mind the characterization because it was “easier than explaining” alternative views.\n\nMamdani confirmed he maintains that position but emphasized the productive nature of their discussion. He said their conversation focused on affordability issues including housing costs, childcare expenses, grocery prices, utility bills, themes central to his campaign.\n\nThe mayor-elect identified specific obstacles to addressing these concerns, citing zoning regulations, approval processes, construction costs. He particularly highlighted childcare expenses, noting they represent the second-largest cost for families at $22,500 annually per child.\n\nMamdani explained his strategy of building a working relationship with the federal government by emphasizing shared priorities. He referenced conversations with New York voters who supported Trump, using their concerns to find common ground with the president.\n\nThe meeting extended beyond the Oval Office to include time in the Cabinet Room, where Mamdani said they viewed historical presidential portraits, including one of former president Franklin D. Roosevelt. He drew parallels between his vision for New York and the legendary partnership between Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia and FDR during the New Deal era.\n\n“You can’t tell the story of LaGuardia without telling the story of FDR and the story of a relationship with the federal government that finally delivered at the scale of the crisis it was facing,” Zohran said. \n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Truth Social wrote: “It was a Great Honor meeting Zohran Mamdani, the new Mayor of New York City!”\n\nNew York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani wrote on X: “Working people have been left behind in New York. In the wealthiest city in the world, one in five can’t afford $2.90 for the train or bus. As I told Trump today—it’s time to put those people right back at the heart of our politics.”\n\nWhat Happens Next?\n\nMamdani takes office on New Year’s Day 2026.",

You said, in those since-deleted tweets, that the Metropolitan Police Department in Nashville should be dissolved, another shared on a teacher's union tweet that Defund the Police should be a requirement for schools reopening, and another saying \"Good morning to the 54% of Americans who believe that burning down a police station is justified.\" 2020 was a very fraught year. Do you still stand by those comments, and if not, is there anything you want to clarify?BEHN: Uh – I'm not going to engage in cable-news talking points, but what I will say is our communities need solutions, we need local people deciding, solving local problems with local solutions. And that's not the overreach of a federal government or a state government, of which we are dealing with in Nashville and our cities across the state of Tennessee. If Behn does not want to \"engage in cable-news talking points,\" why is she making an appearance on cable news? It's not as if Behn wandered into a TV studio accidentally. Behn did the interview in an attempt to rescue her special-election campaign in a congressional district that has a Cook index of R+10 and which went for Donald Trump and Marsha Blackburn last year, 60/38. \n\nBehn is, as you can see, a terrible candidate, about as electable as...Jay Jones. \n\nWhich is my point. Democrats keep nominating terrible candidates with backgrounds that should be immediately disqualifying, but it doesn't seem to matter in some cases. Chesa Boudin got elected as the chief law enforcement officer of San Francisco, Jay Jones as Attorney General, and Zohran Mamdani as Mayor of New York City. I could go on, but you get the point. \n\nFor God's sake, Brandon Johnson got elected as Mayor of Chicago! He is more dedicated to Marxism than Mamdani and twice as racist. \n\nDemocrats love their awful candidates, although Boudin was so awful that he got booted. So there is that.\n\nIt's not that Republicans haven't nominated some real clunkers. For all his virtues, Trump is at least partly responsible for some of them. But in many of those cases, the clunkers lost because voters—even voters in love with Trump—exercise at least a modicum of personal judgment. \n\nDemocrats seem to vote on only one issue: opposition to Donald Trump. Their loyalty to that cause is so much greater than to the country or common sense that they will fill out that oval for a serial killer, it seems. They have come close enough, and I hope the experiment is never run. \n\nFor all the talk about love of democracy and belief in the good of the country, that is complete BS. If you voted for Jay Jones, you don't give a damn about anything but knifing Republicans in the back. \n\nDemocrats like to claim that Republicans are in a cult. To which I say: look in the mirror, folks. You are projecting something fierce. \n\nEditor’s Note: Every single day, here at Hot Air, we will stand up and FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT against the radical left and deliver the conservative reporting our readers deserve.

        "text": "Just a few months ago, it seemed that the political landscape was changing permanently, with young people shifting right – especially young men. Democrats spun up a vortex of efforts to win them back, but they often appeared to be flailing. This month’s elections, however, told a different story.\n\nYoung men in the US face a political identity crisis. It should not be controversial to say that the world that many were promised as children has not come to fruition. Two decades of war and a turbulent economy have combined with a massively changing workforce. Young men’s disaffection should come as no real surprise.\n\nAn entire ecosystem of hucksters has emerged to take advantage of these young people, peddling a dark vision that offers violence and control as a response to a changing world. Meanwhile, the Democratic party failed to imagine a political future that included these young men. In Democrats’ parlance, anyone who took one step in that direction was hopelessly lost, unable to see the beautiful egalitarian future that we could create together.\n\nThere is a fine line here. I am not arguing for the redemption, welcome, or whitewashing of the people who have peddled this bleak reality. But we can and should build a political coalition that includes this generation, that doesn’t leave them out in the cold, only to find a home in the most bleak fringes of a political movement that tells them that a lust for control over other people, especially women, is the only way to find meaning.\n\nOn the left, we tell ourselves the story of our own vaunted sympathy, and yet we assign only blame to the young men who do something similar, looking for community and only finding it among the most opportunistic and dangerous political movements. We have done little to welcome them in.\n\nAnd while Democrats had solid policies and economic plans, Republicans, backed by an army of digital content, were able to take the mantle of running on the economy and framing the left as cultural warriors out of touch with the majority of Americans.\n\nBut the good news is that this month’s elections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City show Democrats have learned a lesson.\n\nThe three marquee campaigns of this year were all remarkably similar, despite coming from different parts of the ideological spectrum. Their messaging was relentlessly focused on affordability – how expensive and difficult life has become for the working and middle-class people of their communities. Their solutions covered a wide ideological range, but the focus remained the same.\n\nMost young men, like most trans people and Black people and immigrants and everyone else, are dealing with housing that has skyrocketed in price, especially compared with our parents’ generations. Instead of having one career in our lifetimes, we now have to continually seek new jobs. Living independently as an adult is much more expensive and complicated now than it has been. These affordability campaigns gave young men something to do about those pressures rather than ceding that frustration to the most cynical actors.\n\nUndoubtedly this conversation is easier to have when Donald Trump is taking three steps every day to dismantle the economy. There’s a real sense that the economy is getting worse. That it’s more difficult to pay bills and keep food on the table, especially when Republicans are, quite literally, ensuring that 42 million people cannot afford to keep food on their table by refusing to fund Snap during their government shutdown.\n\nRepublicans got distracted, trying to defend Trump and also trying to repeat his playbook of tying Democrats to the culture war of the moment. But without Trump’s singular ability to control a media narrative, Republicans with far less political talent and capital floundered, making themselves look weak and silly in the process.\n\nThe political miracle is that this ruthless focus on affordability and cost of living may have brought in many of those same young men who had followed Trump a year ago. In Virginia and New Jersey, men under 30 broke for their new Democratic governors, with about six in 10 supporting Spanberger, according to the AP. In New York, young men went for Zohran Mamdani over Andrew Cuomo by a margin of nearly 40 points, according to a Tufts Circle analysis.\n\nIt turns out that these young men are not completely lost to us. We just failed to imagine a reality where they could be in our camp.\n\nAffordability broke through amid the longest government shutdown in US history, as consumer prices were rising ever higher thanks in part to Trump’s tariffs. For all of his bluster, eventually the economic reality becomes an unavoidable political crisis for anyone not far gone in his cult of personality who has to pay their bills.\n\nMikie Sherrill in New Jersey, Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, and Mamdani in New York City showed us that the frustration that every working and middle-class person feels could be directed into a political coalition that sees marginalized people as people also affected by the greed and corruption that has made life unaffordable for so many.\n\nYoung men, like everyone else, are looking for a politics that can make life a little better. Democrats are finally figuring out how to offer them that chance.\n\n Cory Alpert is a PhD researcher at the University of Melbourne looking at the impact of AI on democracy.

        "text": "Over the weekend, Elon Musk’s X rolled out a feature that had the immediate result of sowing maximum chaos. The update, called “About This Account,” allows people to click on the profile of an X user and see such information as: which country the account was created in, where its user is currently based, and how many times the username has been changed. Nikita Bier, X’s head of product, said the feature was “an important first step to securing the integrity of the global town square.” Roughly four hours later, with the update in the wild, Bier sent another post: “I need a drink.”\n\nAlmost immediately, “About This Account” stated that many prominent and prolific pro-MAGA accounts, which signaled that they were run by “patriotic” Americans, were based in countries such as Nigeria, Russia, India, and Thailand. @MAGANationX, an account with almost 400,000 followers and whose bio says it is a “Patriot Voice for We The People,” is based in “Eastern Europe (Non-EU),” according to the feature, and has changed its username five times since the account was made, last year. On X and Bluesky, users dredged up countless examples of fake or misleading rage-baiting accounts posting aggressive culture-war takes to large audiences. An account called “Maga Nadine” claims to be living in and posting from the United States but is, according to X, based in Morocco. An “America First” account with 67,000 followers is apparently based in Bangladesh. Poetically, the X handle @American is based in Pakistan, according to the feature.\n\nAt first glance, these revelations appear to confirm what researchers and close observers have long known: that foreign actors (whether bots or humans) are posing as Americans and piping political-engagement bait, mis- and disinformation, and spam into people’s timeline. (X and Musk did not respond to my requests for comment.)\n\nX’s decision to show where accounts are based is, theoretically, a positive step in the direction of transparency for the platform, which has let troll and spam accounts proliferate since Musk’s purchase, in late 2022. And yet the scale of the deception—as revealed by the “About” feature—suggests that in his haste to turn X into a political weapon for the far right, Musk may have revealed that the platform he’s long called “the number 1 source of news on Earth” is really just a worthless, poisoned hall of mirrors.\n\nIf only it were that simple. Adding to the confusion of the feature’s rollout are multiple claims from users that the “About” function has incorrectly labeled some accounts. The X account of Hank Green, a popular YouTuber, says his account is based in Japan; Green told me Sunday that he’d never been to Japan. Bier posted on X that there were “a few rough edges that will be resolved by Tuesday,” referring to potentially incorrect account information. (On some accounts, a note is appended pointing out that the user may be operating X through a proxy connection, such as a VPN, which would produce misleading information.) For now, the notion that there might be false labels could give any bad actor the ability to claim they’ve been mislabeled.\n\nThis is the final post-truthification of a platform that long ago pivoted toward a maxim used by the journalist Peter Pomerantsev to refer to post-Soviet Russia: Nothing is true and everything is possible. This is how you get people apparently faking that the Department of Homeland Security’s account was created in Israel (a claim that has 2 million views and counting); both DHS and Bier had to intervene and assure users that the government’s account was not a foreign actor. High-profile right-wing accounts that previously served as yes-men for Musk—such as Ian Miles Cheong, a Malaysian who purportedly lives in the United Arab Emirates and posts incessant, racist drivel about American politics—have melted down over the platform’s decision to dox users.\n\nAcross the site, people are using the feature to try to score political points. Prominent posters have argued that the mainstream media have quoted mislabeled accounts without “minimum due diligence.” This nightmare is not limited to trolls or influencers. On Sunday, the Israel Foreign Ministry posted a screenshot of an account that purported to be reporting news from Gaza, next to a screenshot saying it was based in Poland. “Reporting from Gaza is fake & not reliable. Makes you wonder how many more fake reports have you read?” In response, the person in question posted a video on X on Sunday evening insisting he was in Gaza, living in a tent after military strikes killed his wife and three children. “I’ve been living in Gaza, I am living now in Gaza, and I will continue living in Gaza until I die.”\n\nWatching all of this unfold has been dizzying. On Sunday, I encountered a post claiming that, according to the “About” feature, a popular and verified Islamophobic, pro-Israel account (that posts aggressively about American politics, including calling for Zohran Mamdani’s deportation) was based in “South Asia” and had changed its username 15 times. When I went to X to verify, I noticed that this same account had spent Saturday posting screenshots of other political accounts, accusing them of being fake “Pakistani Garbage.” This is X in 2025: Potentially fake accounts crying at other potentially fake accounts that they aren’t real, all while refusing to acknowledge that they themselves aren’t who they say they are—a Russian nesting doll of bullshit.\n\nThere are a few ways to interpret all of this. First is that this is a story about incentives. Platforms not only goad users into posting more and more extreme and provocative content by rewarding them with attention; they also help people monetize that attention. Just before the 2016 election, BuzzFeed’s Craig Silverman and Lawrence Alexander uncovered a network of Macedonian teens who recognized that America’s deep political divisions were a lucrative vein to exploit and pumped out bogus news articles that were designed to go viral on Facebook, which they then put advertisements on. Today it’s likely that at least some of these bogus MAGA accounts make pennies on the dollar via X’s Creator program, which rewards engaging accounts with a cut of advertising revenue; many of them have the telltale blue check mark.\n\nAs Bellingcat’s Eliot Higgins noted on Bluesky, X’s architecture turns what should be an information ecosystem into a performative one. “Actors aren’t communicating; they’re staging provocations for yield,” he wrote. “The result is disordered discourse: signals detached from truth, identity shaped by escalation, and a feedback loop where the performance eclipses reality itself.” Beyond the attentional and financial rewards, platforms such as X have gutted their trust-and-safety or moderation teams in service of a bastardized notion of free-speech maximalism—creating the conditions for this informational nightmare.\n\nThe second lesson here is that X appears to be inflating the culture wars in ultimately unknowable but certainly important ways. On X this weekend, I watched one (seemingly real) person coming to terms with this fact. “Fascinating to look through every account I’ve disagreed with and find out they’re all fake,” they posted on Saturday. To be certain, X is not the main cause for American political division or arguing online, but it is arguably one of its greatest amplifiers. X is still a place where many journalists and editors in newsrooms across America share and consume political news. Political influencers, media personalities, and even politicians will take posts from supposed ordinary accounts and hold them up as examples of their ideological opponents’ dysfunction, corruption, or depravity.\n\nHow many of these accounts, arguments, or news cycles were a product of empty rage bait, proffered by foreign or just fake actors? Recent examples suggest the system is easily gamed: 32 to 37 percent of the online activity around Cracker Barrel’s controversial logo change this summer was driven by fake accounts, according to consultants hired by the restaurant chain. It’s impossible to know the extent of this manufactured outrage, but it doesn’t necessarily matter—the presence of so much fakery makes it possible to cast aspersions on any piece of information, any actor, or any conversation to the point that the truth is effectively meaningless.\n\nIt’s worth stepping back to see this for what it is: the complete perversion of the actual premise of not just social media but the internet. Although this crisis centers on X, most major social-media networks have fallen victim to variants of this problem. Fakery and manipulation are inevitable for platforms at this scale. Even when Twitter and Facebook were more committed to battling outside influence or enforcing platform rules, they were playing whack-a-mole. The idealism that these companies were founded with—Mark Zuckerberg wanted to connect the world, and Musk has said he wants to maximize free speech (Twitter’s original founders used similar language)—has decayed as they steered their products toward maximizing profits and playing politics. The self-proclaimed techno-utopians in Silicon Valley who have helped build, invest in, or cheerlead for these companies have enabled this ruin. They’ve traded reality for profit and prioritized technologies that aren’t just soulless and amoral, but inhuman in the most literal sense of the word.\n\nA rational response to all of this would be for people to log off. Indeed, that now seems like the least likely, but most optimistic, conclusion—that a group of people who realize they’re being goaded into participation in an algorithmic fun house decide to opt out of a psychologically painful discourse trap altogether. We should all be so lucky.",

She had donated $1,100 to Mamdani’s campaign.\n\nMamdani was flanked by several lower-profile, but still influential advocates and experts who’ll be part of his transition committees — including Annemarie Gray, executive director of the vocal YIMBY group Open New York, on one focused on housing.\n\nGray, who’s also a veteran of the de Blasio administration, and Open New York helped push voters to pass ballot measures giving the mayor new powers over building new housing.\n\n“I joined this committee because Zohran is committed to an all-of-the-above approach to the housing crisis that we know New York City needs, one that protects current tenants, while also building the homes of future families,” she said.\n\nThe two new committees consist of a grab bag of local organizers, labor leaders and policy experts, including Ai-jen Poo, who heads the National Domestic Workers Alliance, received a 2014 MacArthur “Genius” Grant and once attended the Golden Globes with actress Meryl Streep.\n\nMamdani argued the worker justice committee was necessary because of how the city has failed blue-collar New Yorkers in the past.\n\nHe said the community organizing committee likewise addresses a gap.\n\n“There has too often been a distance between the intent of what City Hall does and the impact of what it actually has in any given neighborhood across the five boroughs,” he said. “And you will typically find out from the New Yorkers who live there of the ways in which it’s fallen short.\n\n“We want to use this period as an opportunity where we learn from those lessons, we learn from that history, and we also learn how City Hall could be far more effective in actually executing its vision.”\n\n— Additional reporting by Carl Campanile",

        "text": "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries insisted Monday that he didn’t coordinate with Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on the New York City Democratic Socialists of America’s decision not to endorse his primary challenger. \n\n“No. We’re focused on making sure that the mayor-elect is successful in terms of delivering upon both his affordability agenda as well as his public safety agenda,” Jeffries (D-Brooklyn) said, when asked if he struck a possible deal with Mamdani, a DSA member.\n\nThe Queens assemblyman just last week urged his fellow NYC DSA comrades in a closed-door meeting not to back Brooklyn City Councilman Chi Ossé, who was seeking the group’s endorsement for his campaign against the top House Democrat.\n\nA key group within the DSA’s local chapter later narrowly voted against endorsing Ossé’s Dem primary challenge.\n\nA source told The Post that Mamdani’s camp had tried to get ahead of potential blowback from the minority leader by leaking a story about the mayor-elect attempting to dissuade Ossé from mounting the uphill primary challenge.\n\nA representative for Mamdani did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJeffries, meanwhile, was in his Eighth Congressional District Monday jumping on Mamdani’s key campaign issue of affordability with a press conference in Bedford-Stuyvesant about food insecurity. \n\nBut he said he hadn’t discussed with Mamdani the incoming mayor’s signature campaign promise to open city-run grocery stores, one in each borough, in an attempt to provide more affordable food and other goods to New Yorkers in need.\n\n“I look forward to having a conversation with him – we speak frequently – but look forward to having a conversation with him about that particular policy proposal,” he said, while specifically commending Mamdani’s focus on the overall affordability issue.\n\nThe moderate congressman — who waited until just days before the Nov. 4 election to offer a lukewarm endorsement for Mamdani as mayor — also didn’t directly answer when asked if he had any reservations about the proposed program.\n\n“I think that generally, Mayor-elect Mamdani has been strongly focused on the issue of affordability, but as he transitions from where he is not into the mayorship, it’s going to be important to figure out how at the city, state and federal level we can all align to make sure that we’re delivering on the policy things that he’s proposed,” he said.\n\nOssé has said that his primary campaign would attempt to win over voters by comparing federal military spending to defend Israel against investments in the district, The Post previously reported.\n\nWithout mentioning Ossé by name, Bed-Stuy Assemblywoman Stefani Zinerman told Jeffries at the event “nobody could do your job,” emphasizing the number of federal funds that have flowed to the district.\n\n“It is hard going to work every day to have to fight for people to have a moral code, the decency to just have resources – for people to have food on the table, a good job and healthcare to take care of their family,” she said.\n\nJeffries continued to praise Mamdani’s decision to retain Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch to lead the NYPD in his incoming administration. \n\n“I think that’s a great thing for the communities that I represent, a great thing for the city, and a great thing for his administration to get off to a fast start on public safety,” he said.",

        "text": "And she’s unlikely to be the only GOP lawmaker heading for the exit.\nAs Punchbowl News’ Jake Sherman reported Monday, several other House Republicans are considering leaving their post in the middle of the current term over frustrations with the Trump White House and Speaker Mike Johnson. “This entire White House team has treated ALL members like garbage,” a senior GOP member messaged Punchbowl. “And Mike Johnson has let it happen because he wanted it to happen.”\n“The arrogance of this White House team is off-putting to members who are run roughshod and threatened,” the member added, saying that Republican lawmakers have little hope of maintaining the House majority they held on to in 2024. They predicted more high-profile resignations, and that Johnson would lose his gavel. “Morale has never been lower.”\nIt’s a far cry from where Republicans were this time last year. In 2024 they were coming off a resounding electoral victory—they took the White House, retained control of the House of Representatives, and won back the Senate—and believed they had been given a “mandate” to radically remake America, as Trump claimed after defeating Kamala Harris. But they quickly abused that so-called mandate, with Trump authorizing Elon Musk to take a “chainsaw” to the federal government; forcing through his unpopular “big, beautiful bill”; and pursuing an aggressive tariff regime that has exacerbated the economic precarity he told voters he’d remedy. The public frustration with Trump has intensified further in recent months amid his administration’s brutal immigration crackdown, a historic shutdown, and his handling of the Epstein files—the latter of which was a catalyst for the rupture between Trump and Greene.\nCongress, meanwhile, has been “mostly sidelined,” as Greene lamented in a lengthy statement announcing her resignation, which will be effective January 5. Johnson has outsourced much of his chamber’s legislative duties to the White House, which is unilaterally pushing tariffs, conducting strikes on what it claims are drug boats in the Caribbean, and even replacing the East Wing with an ostentatious ballroom. The bulk of Johnson’s job, as he is currently performing it, appears to be standing in front of reporters and saying that he didn’t hear about the latest Trump scandal.\nThis year of chaos, cowardice, and corruption culminated in off year elections earlier this month that could foreshadow a 2026 blue wave. Democrats dominated in races across the country, including in high-profile contests in Virginia and New Jersey—where moderates Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill won gubernatorial elections—as well as in New York City, where democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani was elected to succeed Eric Adams as mayor. Even Trump acknowledged afterward, “I don’t think it was good for Republicans.”\nIt’s understandable why some Republicans might be frustrated with the position he and the sycophantic Johnson have put them in. But any lawmakers who are considering following Greene’s lead might want to look in the mirror before they leave the House and ask themselves what, exactly, they expected to happen when they cast their lot with Trump. In 2024, Democrats learned the hard way about the pitfalls of making opposition to Trump the core of their political identity. Perhaps Republicans, 10 years into this loathsome MAGA era, will finally be made to understand the danger of basing their entire political identity around supporting him.",

        "text": "In early October, RedState issued a warning about the critical need for local vetting of candidates before they run for higher office and potentially rise to positions of state and national prominence. \n\nCitizens must work to recognize and neutralize terrible candidates at the local level, before they have the chance to not just wreck a school board or a city, but a municipality, an entire state, and potentially, the nation. \n\nRead More: Des Moines School Board and VA AG Race Show Local Communities Must Vet Before Candidates Gain a Foothold\n\nFor New York City and Virginia, the die has been cast. Communist and Democrat Socialist Zohran Mamdani is now New York's mayor-elect. As for Virginia, they elected the sociopath Jay Jones, a Democrat legislator who ran for attorney general, even though text messages were exposed where he fantasized about violent deaths for his Republican colleague, his wife, and his children. This is a tragic commentary on not just voter standards, but the cavalier attitude toward violence that certain Americans have embraced — especially when the violence is directed toward people who hold views they don't like.\n\nAlso in early October, while the majority of politicos were obsessing over both these races and the New Jersey governorship, a school board in NJ's Monmouth County exposed what will now be known as \"The Jay Jones Effect.\" Marlboro Township School Board member Danielle Bellomo, a conservative and self-proclaimed supporter of President Donald Trump, was targeted by Scott Semaya, a liberal candidate for the board, with sexually-charged and violent threats over a text thread that allegedly involved the board vice president and the husband of one of its members.\n\nYou cannot make this stuff up. \n\nA New Jersey school board candidate was caught red-handed sending vicious, sexual messages about a conservative female board member in a group chat labeled “ThisBitchNeedsToDie.”Photos of Scott Semaya’s vile texts about Danielle Bellomo at a July school board meeting leaked this week on social media — and the widening scandal is now being investigated by local cops and roiling the affluent suburb of Marlboro.“Bellomo must be cold — her nips could cut glass right n” read one text, allegedly captured on camera while Semaya’s fingers typed an “o.”Outrage was immediate, and Semaya this week dropped out of the race for the Marlboro Board of Education, followed by his running mate Melissa Goldberg.The scandal in the leafy Monmouth County enclave has drawn parallels to the recent controversy in Virginia, where attorney general candidate Jay Jones was recently outed for a 2022 text message suggesting the state’s then-Republican House Speaker deserved to be shot in the head.“It was absolutely terrifying,” Bellomo exclusively told The Post. “When I found out about the messages I was absolutely shocked, especially with the climate of our country. It sent chills down my spine.\n\nIt should send chills down all our spines. This is a school board, where the education and concerns for the children of the community are supposed to trump any political leanings or personal animus. \n\nApparently not. \n\nSo, what evil has Bellomo done that has caused these hyperbolic and vicious attacks? She ran and won on a platform of curriculum transparency and parental rights, and she continues to stand for these things.\n\nBellomo has spent more than a decade volunteering in Marlboro Township schools. She says she ran for the board to support curriculum transparency and parental rights, not to become a target.\"I got involved in the school boards because I’m an active volunteer in our community. I’ve been involved with the parent organization that I account for going on 12 years,\" she said. \"So I saw the school board as the next step in furthering my involvement in the community and I wanted it to enhance my children’s educational experience while they were in the K-3 district. I never imagined that it would have led to this.\"\n\nYet Democrats and the left persist in downplaying this type of violent and charged rhetoric when it is directed toward conservatives and Republican candidates and officials. Even Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) commented on Bellomo's case, pointing out that the political violence seems to be weighted to one side and one side only.\n\nBut last week, Democrat electeds decided to create a video about the military having a constitutional duty to \"defy illegal orders\" from President Donald Trump, knowingly skating a line that could be classified as sedition. When the president called them out with a post that outlines what the price of sedition is, they cried about violence and hateful rhetoric. \n\nDive Deeper: Morning Minute: The Dems Released a Sedition-y Ad, and I Have Questions\n\nTo make a finer point: These types of dangerous individuals with flexible allegiances and violent fantasies are sitting in our U.S. Congress, trying to start a color revolution. How many of them started out as a city council person or on the school board? We need to start taking the vetting and ruling out of local candidates seriously. Many of these people should not be elected to dog catcher, let alone have public oversight over a school district, a city, or a county. Another illustration of this is playing out in Nashville with Democrat congressional candidate Aftyn Behn. She is being vetted and exposed ahead of a special election, and let us hope the citizens of Nashville are paying attention. Like this circumstance in New Jersey, these opportunistic and sociopathic characters must be exposed early and barred from any form of elected office. \n\nThe vicious chat group was believed to be composed of five men, and allegedly included Chad Hyett, current Marlboro school board vice president, according to a source. Many in the town of 41,000 are now calling for Hyett’s resignation.Semaya and Goldberg were running on a purportedly apolitical slate called Collaborators for Responsible Education, or CORE. The third candidate on the slate, longtime incumbent Michael Lilonsky, remains in the race. He did not return a message.Goldberg told New Jersey’s Patch.com she was abandoning her bid for the board because she “currently cannot commit to this role in addition to my other responsibilities.”\n\nUnlike Jay Jones, Semaya had some modicum of shame and stepped out of the race. But it only gets worse. Weeks after the egregious text thread was laid bare, Bellamo revealed in a school board meeting that board VP Chad Hyett had been harassing her for months over social media. One of the thoughts Hyett shared about Bellomo was that she is \"a real piece of work and a stain on our board.\"\n\nThe Marlboro BOE meeting last week was straight-up chaotic—and heartbreaking. Board member Danielle Bellomo bravely shared how Vice President Chad Hyett relentlessly harassed and trashed her on social media before the vile group chat surfaced, where he and others plotted her death ('ThisBitchNeedsToDie'). He refuses to step down from the Board of Education as the vice president.\n\nAccording to the New York Post, Bellomo filed a temporary protective order against one person who is alleged to be part of the text chain: Mitesh Gandhi, whose wife happens to be a board member. \n\nA Monmouth County judge this week extended a temporary protective order against Mitesh Gandhi, the husband of another school board member, after reading aloud a series of text messages allegedly written by him. The messages included a group chat titled, \"This B---- Needs to Die.\"In one of the text threads, Gandhi allegedly referred to Bellomo as \"a lying c---\" and wrote, \"Mission is to just let her die by herself lol.\"\n\nFox Digital reported that a judge extended that temporary protective order through January 2026.\n\nThe judge overseeing the protective-order hearing refused to dismiss Gandhi’s request to end the order, allowing Bellomo’s protective order to continue through January, when a full trial will be held. Under New Jersey law, a harassment-related protective order can be extended if a judge finds an ongoing risk to the petitioner.\n\nDespite the Marlboro Township Police Department recommending criminal charges, the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office has declined to do so. But Bellomo's disappointment is extended toward the Township district and board president's handling of the situation.\n\nBellomo says the most painful part has been the response, or lack thereof, from her own school district. One of the text threads, she claims, was sent during an in-person board meeting while she sat just feet away.\"Our township has policies. If someone is a threat, they’re not supposed to be allowed on school property,\" she said. \"Our superintendent, Dr. Michael Ballone, did nothing. Our board president, Brian Cohen, did nothing. They chose not to implement the policies that are already in place.\"\n\nBellomo also points out that this situation has produced a chilling effect. Upstanding citizens who should be running for public office are too afraid to do it because of the ugliness perpetrated by these men.\n\nBellomo says she has already heard from dozens of women who say her situation has scared them away from public service.\"They say, ‘I could never go through what you’re going through,’\" she said. \"That’s heartbreaking. Local government should not require you to put your family at risk.\"\n\nLocal government should not require that citizens resign themselves to being led by unconscientious and insane people. We must confront and deny them, and encourage brave individuals like Danielle Bellomo to step into the fray. Otherwise, we will continue to foster the Jay Jones Effect and see our nation rot from the inside out. \n\nAbraham Lincoln said it well:\n\nWe the people are the rightful masters of both Congress and the courts, not to overthrow the Constitution but to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution. \n\nEditor's Note: President Trump is fighting to dismantle the Department of Education and ensure America's kids get the education they deserve.\n\nHelp us fight back against Big Government waste and restore power back to the states.

        "text": "Radio host Charlamagne tha God said on Monday he doesn’t want to hear politicians recklessly accuse each other of fascism or communism anymore after the friendly meeting between President Donald Trump and NYC mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. The assassination attempts on Trump's life and the murder of TPUSA co-founder Charlie Kirk have sparked a national conversation about whether accusing one’s political opponent of extremism is contributing to a dangerous political environment. The friendly meeting between the two elected leaders made headlines for being surprisingly chummy after months of wary rhetoric from both. In one viral moment, Trump gracefully shrugged off a reporter asking Mamdani about his past comments of Trump being a fascist, saying he doesn’t care. Charlamagne argued in the \"Donkey of the Day\" segment of Monday’s episode of the \"Breakfast Club\" that the Trump-Mamdani meeting proved such accusations are overused and hypocritical. CHARLAMAGNE TELLS VAN JONES TO 'SHUT THE F UP FOREVER' AFTER CALLING MAMDANI’S VICTORY SPEECH DIVISIVE \"I don't want to hear any politicians call each other ‘fascists,’ ‘authoritarians,’ ‘wannabe dictators,’ ‘communists,’ none of that kind of rhetoric anymore. It's all dead. Because if you call someone that, and then turn around and say, ‘But I'm willing to work with them,’ it looks hypocritical,\" he said. Charlamagne also reacted to Mamdani’s interview on the following Sunday, when he told NBC host Kristen Welker on \"Meet the Press\" that he still believes Trump is a fascist, but even so, was willing to work with him. \"So, if Zohran truly believes Trump is a fascist, then working with him makes zero sense, but this is my issue. He doesn't fully believe Trump is a fascist, just like Trump doesn't fully believe Mamdani is a communist. It's all political theater,\" Charlamagne said. Charlamagne argued that while such rhetoric is irresponsible on its own, it leaves the voters divided. \"You know who it hurts the most? Us!\" Charlamagne said. \"You done told your aunt and three of your cousins, ‘F you, you [are] not invited to Thanksgiving this year’ because of who they supported politically. Meanwhile, the people we supported politically are willing to support each other. If Zohran and Trump can be in the White House smiling at each other and excessively touching on each other, then you and your family can enjoy Thanksgiving dinner together. Okay?\" ZOHRAN MAMDANI SAYS HE WILL DISCOURAGE 'GLOBALIZE THE INTIFADA' PHRASE He warned, \"Listen, to all elected officials, if you call somebody a ‘fascist’ or ‘communist,’ but then sit down and work with them like everything is normal, you make those words meaningless. Alright? It's dangerous to do that. It's dangerous to weaken those terms, and it confuses the public!\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",

        "text": "President Trump believes he has the upper hand in his budding relationship with Zohran Mamdani, according to a source who helped arrange last week’s bizarre lovefest at the Oval Office – and if you want to know why, just follow the money.\n\nTrump on Friday startled voters and pundits alike as he lauded New York City’s mayor-elect as a “rational person,” who “has a chance to really do something great for New York.” Previously, Trump branded Mamdani a “100 percent communist lunatic,” ripping his stance on taxes, the police and Israel and his refusal to condemn the phrase “globalize the Intifada.” \n\nLikewise, Mamdani, who has referred to Trump as a “fascist” and a “despot,” gushed about the duo’s “shared purpose.”\n\nTo make sense of the surreal spectacle, it’s helpful to know that behind the scenes, the meeting was brokered by a New York business titan close to Trump who believes the president should play the long game with the lefty Mamdani for the good of the city and for his own agenda – particularly as it relates to deportations, The Post has learned. \n\nIt’s also helpful to know that this was after said businessman was approached by a top official in Mamdani’s inner circle. \n\nThe surprise message from Mamdani’s transition team: The mayor-elect – who in his election-night speech had dared Trump to “turn the volume up” – would now like to smooth things over with Trump. \n\nThe Mamdani official indicated the newly elected mayor knows he needs help from the White House to pay for even a few of his vast spending promises and to balance the city budget as he must by law, say people with direct knowledge of the matter. \n\nThat, according to sources, was after Mamdani – a 34-year-old backbench assemblyman and former rapper – was briefed on the $7.5 billion in federal aid the city receives each year. That cash, sources noted, is crucial for his socialist agenda – and could be throttled by the president. \n\n“He faces a $17 billion budget deficit in the next fiscal year to pay for all the free stuff he’s proposing,” said the city business leader who helped organize the event and advised Trump to take the meeting. “Even if (Gov. Kathy) Hochul agrees to raise taxes, he still faces a multibillion-dollar shortfall. He needs Trump and Trump knows it.”\n\n“Trump is playing nice for now,” this person added. “But if Mamdani doesn’t allow deportations, or defunds the police or goes full on communist, Trump is ready to lower the hammer.”\n\nA White House press rep had no immediate comment. A spokesman for Mamdani also had no comment.\n\nTrump holds the upper hand, among other things, because the mayor faces a requirement under state law to balance the budget. Accordingly, the business leader advised the president that he has nothing to lose by offering an olive branch – even if it’s to an avowed socialist with far left cultural views. \n\nIn the weeks and months ahead, however, don’t count on uninterrupted warm and fuzzies. Trump continues to view Mamdani with extreme skepticism. The mayor will only get the money if he tempers his socialist economic and cultural agenda in the city where the president’s real estate empire still has a major footprint.\n\nOver the weekend, Mamdani on a Sunday talk show refused to disavow his past name calling of Trump as a “fascist” and a “despot.”\n\nOnly a few days earlier ahead of the meeting, Mamdani is said to have agreed not to antagonize Trump at the powwow and to keep the conversation on how best to fix the city’s affordability issues. \n\n“What I really appreciate about the president is the meeting that we had focused not on places of disagreement, which there are many, but also focused on the shared purpose that we have in serving New Yorkers,” Mamdani said of Trump in keeping his promise. \n\nIn the next fiscal year, New York City faces a budget shortfall of as much as $8 billion. When accounting for Mamdani’s plans for free buses, massive new spending on housing, plus items like subsidizing trans care for children, the deficit widens to as much as $17 billion, according to some estimates.\n\nMamdani is calling for higher taxes on individuals who make $1 million and a vast increase on the corporate tax rates. Both have to be approved by Gov. Hochul and the state legislature.\n\nHochul has been warming up to Mamdani’s plans, but he must finish the year without a deficit, and raising taxes could force more of the so-called 1% to keep moving out of the state as they have been for the past decade.\n\nAll of that could make Mamdani more beholden to Trump and his policy goals. Some say it’s already happening, pointing to Mamdani’s plans to re-appoint the tough-on-crime NYPD commissioner Jessica Tisch. Ditto for Mamdani’s recent support for the re-election of House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) over a DSA-endorsed challenger. \n\n“Trump is not worried about Mamdani,” said another city business leader. “He has a ‘plan B’ if Mamdani misbehaves.”",

        "text": "At that time, Edwards said, inflation was generally being blamed on raw material prices because of the Ukraine war, as well as the labor market, with very few people saying there was profit-driven inflation, but he took a different view: “This is unprecedented,” he noted, pointing out, “when unit costs rise, always, unit margins fall, always, in history.” He said that shouldn’t have happened, and the reason it did was because of so much stimulus from the government that “companies could get away with doing it, using [inflation as] cover.”\n\nThe consequence of this money printing and fiscal expenditure was a “bonanza for the corporate sector,” resulting in corporate profit margins soaring “off to infinity” after the pandemic. Edwards noted specific sectors benefited enormously, recalling a St. Louis Fed study that showed corporate profits as a share of national income surging since the inflation spike, a total outlier compared with the rest of the world.\n\nThis period of corporate excess laid the groundwork for severe political instability and public outrage, Edwards argued. Just look at the election in New York, he said, which was all about the cost of living. Zohran Mamdani’s election is “an indication that this still is a big issue.” Edwards agreed “affordability” is a major topic of the moment, along with the U.S. housing market: “It stands out as, like, ‘What’s going on?’”\n\nThis latest twist in the populist turn isn’t necessarily something to celebrate, Edwards said. As an economist, he said he considers Mamdani’s policies, deriving from his democratic socialist background, such as rent control and price controls, to be “lunacy,” having experienced them himself in the 1970s. Still, dysfunction in capitalism means that society will “come back full circle to this.” The increasing intergenerational strife, driven by young people being shut out of the housing market and out of wealth concentration, has created a primal sense of betrayal, especially among Americans who no longer feel they are better off than their parents.\n\nEdwards was speaking as the first-time homebuyer hit an average age of 40 years old, a stark symbol of how the largely youthful voter base that elected Mamdani is shut out of the market. Sean Dobson, CEO of the Amherst Group, one of America’s largest institutional landlords, recently estimated the same post-COVID economic landscape that so outraged Edwards meant “we’ve probably made housing unaffordable for a whole generation of Americans.”\n\n‘You reap what you sow’\n\nComing back to his critique of capitalism, Edwards argued Mamdani’s election is “part of the consequence … The corporates, by being excessively greedy, hence ‘greedflation,’ have laid the seeds for their own destruction—and backlash.” Edwards added that “more and more people are identifying corporate excess.”\n\nSpeaking about what he called “intergenerational strife,” Edwards said he thinks this is “the first generation where people are not seeing themselves as better off than their parents were.” Everywhere you look in modern capitalism, “young people can’t get on the housing ladder, they see wealth extremely concentrated … It takes the incentivization out of the economy if young people don’t feel they’re participating.”\n\nEdwards’s argument here has some strange bedfellows, as none other than Peter Thiel has been warning about this incentivization problem for years. Mamdani’s election seemed to send a shiver through Silicon Valley’s right-wing contingent, as Chamath Palihapitiya shared Peter Thiel’s 2020 email to Mark Zuckerberg and Marc Andreessen, warning of a “broken generational compact” and reasoning, “if one has no stake in the capitalist system, then one may well turn against it.” In a follow-up interview days later, Thiel told The Free Press, “if you proletarianize the young people, you shouldn’t be surprised if they eventually become communist.”\n\nOn the left wing of legal thought, Columbia Law School professor Tim Wu recently told Fortune that he wrote his new book, The Age of Extraction, about a similar feeling. “My understanding of America is that it’s the place where things are supposed to get better,” Wu said, but instead we’re living through a time with “an economy-wide problem” where “everything kind of just creeps. It’s that weird feeling of something you like becoming worse.” He added that American politics right now are “very angry” and marked by “economic resentment” but also a general feeling that “we let things go a little too far” and we “just kind of lost touch with the tradition of broad-based wealth that was the American way.”\n\nOn the subject of greedflation, Edwards was philosophical but insisted that what happened in 2023 was a mistake. “Okay, I can understand this is capitalism, this is how it works,” he said about pursuit of the profit motive, “but if the government doesn’t step in” then a backlash is bound to happen. Edwards declined to say whether this was a particularly Democratic or Republican issue, but, he noted, “there’s a reluctance” in American culture to dictate to the corporate sector. At any rate, the consequence of it is “there’s a day of reckoning coming in,” he said.\n\nEdwards, who is also convinced artificial intelligence is in a bubble, said he views his role in this often overly optimistic market as similar to “Caesar’s slave,” referring to the story from antiquity about the Roman emperor ordering someone to follow him around and always whisper in one ear: “You are mortal.” (This is also commonly referred to by the Latin phrase “memento mori.”) Edwards warns while the macro-level excesses might not be visible in aggregate, drilling down reveals “things are pretty crappy under the surface.” The political reaction embodied by Mamdani’s focus on affordability is a clear sign that the economic consequences of corporate greed are now driving mainstream political change. \n\nEdwards concluded there’s a fitting phrase for the dysfunctions of capitalism in the 2020s: “You reap what you sow.”",

        "text": "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt broke her silence on New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. Leavitt was asked about Mamdani’s ‘fascist’ label for Donald Trump, and she replied, “I think talk is cheap… and I think the President is going to judge Mamdani by his actions that he takes in New York.”\n\nKaroline Leavitt went on to describe the Trump-Mamdani meeting as “positive” and continued, “The meeting was positive as you heard from the President last week and I think the fact that the President is willing to meet with somebody who said those types of things about him shows that he really is interested in being a President for all Americans regardless of where they live or who their leader is.”\n\nIn her response to the reporter, Karoline Leavitt spoke about Trump’s long association with New York and said, “He wants what’s best for New York. He loves New York City. He helped build the skyline. He spent his whole life there and so he really wants to see New York do well. So, that’s how that meeting played last week.”\n\n.@PressSec on NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani: “Talk is cheap… The fact that @POTUS is willing to meet with somebody who said those types of things about him shows that he really is interested in being a President for ALL Americans.” pic.twitter.com/uA6pDjde36\n— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) November 24, 2025\n\nDuring their Oval Office meeting last week, Mamdani was asked by a reporter stationed there, “Just days ago, you referred to Trump as a ‘despot’ and accused him of having a fascist agenda. Are you planning to retract any of these remarks?”\n\nDuring the meeting, Trump said that it was ok for Mamdani to refer to the President as a ‘despot.’ Mamdani straight up told the reporter, “We are both very clear on our positions and our views, and what I really appreciate about the president is our meeting focused not on places of disagreement but the shared purpose we have.” In addition to Mamdani’s answer, Trump responded, “I’ve been called much worse than a despot.\n\n.@POTUS on Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani: “He’s got views that are a little out there, but who knows. We’re going to see what works.” pic.twitter.com/5qBVFKDLxm\n— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) November 21, 2025\n\nAfter the meeting, both Trump and Mamdani seemed to have taken a U-turn from their original views about each other. The President claimed that the meeting actually “surprised” him. He wants to see no crime. He wants to see housing being built. He wants to see rents coming down. All things that I agree with,” Trump said.\n\nHe added, “I expect to be helping him, not hurting him — a big help, because I want New York City to be great. I think he wants to make it greater than ever before and if he can, we’ll be out there cheering. I’ll be cheering for him.”\n\nMeanwhile, here’s what Mamdani said about Trump after the Oval Office meeting on Friday, “I appreciated the time with the president. I appreciated your conversation. We are very clear about our positions and our views, and what I really appreciate about the president is the meeting that we had focused not on places of disagreement, of which there are many, but instead focused on the shared purpose that we have in serving New Yorkers.”\n\nTrump and Mamdani’s equation can be labeled as somewhat complicated. The two publicly challenged each other on several occasions. During his victory speech in New York earlier this month, Mamdani, openly challenging Trump, said, “Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up.”\n\nBefore the exchange of heated words, Trump claimed in an interaction with the media that he’s “much better-looking” than Mamdani. To which, the democratic socialist replied, “My focus is on the cost-of-living crisis, bro.”",

        "text": "Zohran Mamdani reaffirmed on national television that he still considers US President Donald Trump a 'fascist', just days after what appeared to be a surprisingly friendly Oval Office meeting.\n\nIn a Meet the Press interview aired on 23 November 2025, the New York City mayor-elect flatly stated, 'Everything that I've said in the past, I continue to believe'.\n\nUnlikely Cordiality in the Oval Office\n\nOn 21 November 2025, Mamdani and Trump met in the White House for a 45-minute session. The tone was unexpectedly warm, given their prior political animosity.\n\nDuring a press-conference-style exchange, a reporter asked Mamdani if he still characterised Trump as a 'fascist'. Trump, who has frequently clashed with Mamdani, intervened. 'That's OK. You can just say yes ... It's easier than explaining', he said, patting Mamdani on the arm.\n\nMamdani smiled and said, 'Yes'.\n\nReaffirming the Critique — With Purpose\n\nIn the television interview, Mamdani made clear he had not softened his critique. He said that working with Trump did not mean abandoning his previous assessments. 'That's something that I've said in the past. I say it today', he told NBC's Kristen Welker.\n\nHe framed his willingness to cooperate not as a betrayal, but as an act of responsibility. 'I think working for the people of New York City demands that you work with everyone and anyone — and that you always look to find those areas of agreement while not overlooking the places of disagreement,' he said.\n\nMamdani also emphasised that his trip to the White House was not a symbolic gesture. He told Welker, 'I'm coming in there to deliver for New Yorkers', pointing to the central issues on his agenda: housing, childcare, groceries, utilities.\n\nFar from retaliating, Trump struck a conciliatory tone during the meeting. He defended Mamdani from adversarial questions, calling him 'a very rational person'.\n\nHe also expressed optimism about Mamdani's ability to govern, saying, 'We agree on a lot more than I would have thought ... I want him to do a great job'.\n\nAt one point, when Mamdani mentioned his cost-of-living concerns for New Yorkers, Trump publicly signalled his support. 'We are going to be helping him ... having a strong and very safe New York', he said.\n\nA Strategic Meeting With Sharp Undercurrents\n\nObservers have described the meeting as politically calculated. On the surface, it was a spectacle, long-feuding figures sharing smiles, shaking hands. But under that veneer lies something more transactional. Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, and Trump, the Republican President, found common ground on affordability.\n\nMamdani noted that when he asked his constituents, including Trump voters, why they supported him, they consistently raised cost-of-living as their top issue. In their meeting, he said, this theme came 'back again and again', messaging that may resonate beyond their ideological divide.\n\nBy reasserting his 'fascist' label, Mamdani underscores a larger political point. Ideological disagreements do not preclude governance. He insists that his deep-rooted critique of Trump's style and policies remains intact, even as he negotiates with him.\n\nHis remarks also reflect a broader anxiety on the left about the erosion of democratic norms. Mamdani's use of 'despot' and 'fascist' is not idle insults, they serve as warnings. He has argued, repeatedly, that his election is not simply about policy, but about resisting authoritarian tendencies.\n\nIn a moment of political theatre, Mamdani and Trump found cordiality; yet the ideological chasm remains gaping, and Mamdani is unrepentant.\n\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK",

        "text": "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins declared on Monday during an interview about affordability that the American dream is making a comeback under the Trump administration and \"real relief\" was coming \"very soon.\" \"But as we’re restructuring the entire economy, as we’re bringing down inflation, bringing down fuel, bringing down labor, Americans, we believe, will see real relief very, very soon. Those numbers are already down, but much more to come,\" she told CNBC. \"This administration has been incredibly focused on getting the American dream back into every American’s home and goals, et cetera. And affordability is a huge piece of that. Of course, I’m the agriculture secretary. So food, food production, supporting our farmers and ranchers is a big piece,\" she said. Affordability has been a dominant political topic in 2025, with Democrats like Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race successfully touting addressing price concerns on the campaign trail. President Donald Trump was elected in 2024 in part on frustration with inflation and affordability under the Biden administration, but new polls show impatience with his economic stewardship. TRUMP GROWS FRUSTRATED WITH GOP FOR NOT TOUTING HIS ‘GREATEST ECONOMY IN HISTORY’ Rollins said that the previous administration was a different story. \"And when you look at under Joe Biden the last four years, we had an increase in inputs, interest rates, 73%, fertilizer, 36%, labor increased 47%… No new trade deals during those four years, no way to move the food out,\" she said. \"So when you look at all of that in total, it’s no surprise that what we inherited was an absolute economic mess. But those numbers are coming down.\" She added that nonetheless, \"There are a few outliers. And you mentioned Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent talked about a couple of those yesterday. We’re working on those extremely diligently.\" In response to the trajectory of Trump's tariff agenda, Rollins explained that she has been at Trump’s side for a long time and has seen measurable results. \"His vision of realigning the entire world economy around putting American products first and America first, but also using tariffs as a really important economic tool to make sure that we are doing everything we can for our country and to keep our country at the top of the world,\" she said. \"But what the president did was using these as economic tools, but also important foreign policy tools as well.\" WHEN DID MAGA BECOME MAKE ARGENTINA GREAT AGAIN? She juxtaposed the Trump administration with the preceding Biden administration again, noting the variety of new trade deals that have emerged. \"What the president did with liberation day, with enacting all these tariffs back in February. We now have dozens of new trade deals, and within Indonesia, Australia, Japan, EU, England, it’s just remarkable. And a lot of these deals people tried for 20, 25 years to get these deals again. Under the last administration, we didn’t have one new trade deal. We went from an agriculture trade surplus under Trump to a deficit, $50 billion deficit in just agriculture,\" she said. \"So think about the effects on our farmers and ranchers. $50 billion is a significant amount when you’re growing corn or soybeans or apples or whatever you’re growing. So being able to solve for that, which now we’re doing again, it’s incredible.\" American farmers, she said, have been Trump’s priority since the beginning of his initial campaign and will be receiving forthcoming aid.

        "text": "Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, a Republican whose county neighbors New York City, said that he is directing authorities to install cameras and security technology along the border with the city in light of the election of Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. In an interview with Fox News Digital, Blakeman, who was just re-elected earlier this month to serve a second term in the majority blue county, said he will be taking extra precautions to preserve law and order in Nassau County in light of the socialist mayor-elect, Mamdani. \"We are doing everything necessary to make sure that Nassau County is safe,\" he said. \"We are installing technology along the border of New York City that will read license plates, that will have facial recognition, that will have video cameras.\" He also stated that the county is hiring new police officers in addition to its existing force and the 100 police cadets currently enrolled in the Nassau County Police Academy. NYC SUBURB OFFICIAL REVEALS HOW ICE PARTNERSHIP HAS FLIPPED SCRIPT ON CRIME AS MAMDANI VICTORY LOOMS \"Our cops are doing a great job, and I'm going to continue to give them the personnel and the resources, technology and equipment and training that will now allow them to combat any situation that would jeopardize the security and safety of our communities here in Nassau County,\" he said. Meanwhile, Blakeman said Mamdani \"talks like he's pro-criminal, not pro-victim.\" While Republicans in Virginia, New Jersey and New York suffered electoral defeats earlier this month, Blakeman won his race by close to 12 percentage points. He beat out a Democrat in a county with over 100,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans. He attributes this victory to leaning into his messages on improving public safety and affordability, which he said resonates with all demographics. He did not even shy away from his condemnation of New York sanctuary policies and the county’s partnership with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. NEW YORK LEADER PLEDGES MORE COPS, TOUGHER ICE PARTNERSHIP IF NYC ELECTS SOCIALIST MAYOR \"New York State was an area that was safe, and I think basically that's what the people are craving,\" he explained. \"I never ran away from my pro-Trump policies. I supported the president, and I continue to support the president. People respected me for that, even if they disagree, because they knew that I wasn't a phony.

I'm going to keep taxes down.\" \"Our campaign appealed to the independent voters and crossover Democrats,\" he explained. \"That's why I think we were a bright star on an otherwise dark night on election night.\" This law-and-order message stands in stark contrast with Mamdani’s history of comments calling the police racist, anti-queer and a public safety threat. Though Mamdani walked back those statements during his campaign, his proposal to replace law enforcement officers with mental health workers has raised concerns about a further deepening of crime in New York City.

        "text": "Few would disagree with the notion that President Donald Trump is rather malleable on issues of policy and political alliances. Friends and enemies swap places with surprising regularity. Must-pass initiatives become rejected agendas just as quickly.\n\nAs visual evidence of this, consider two scenes.\n\nBack in February 2025, the president hosted a chummy joint press conference in the Oval Office with the world's richest man, Elon Musk, who outlined his plans to slash the federal government to the bone via his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nThen, just last week, Trump hosted another amicable joint press conference where his guest was the self-described socialist mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani, who plans on making New York City great again with tax hikes on billionaires like Musk to fund billions in new social spending.\n\nThe president was rather unembarrassed when pressed by reporters on his willingness to host someone whom he described as a dangerous communist just a few weeks ago.\n\n\"We all change. I changed a lot, changed a lot from when I first came to office,\" said Trump at last week's press conference.\n\nWhile DOGE did not come up in the president's press conference with Mamdani, their friendly Q&A helps to bookend the sunsetting of his administration's signature state-slashing initiative.\n\nReuters reported yesterday that DOGE no longer exists. Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor told the news outlet that the agency has been disbanded as a standalone entity. Former DOGE staffers have been transferred to another executive initiative tasked with beautifying government websites.\n\nThe DOGE effort to dismantle, reform, and streamline the entire federal government started with such a bang. It's now sunsetting with barely a whimper.\n\nNumerous retrospectives on DOGE's success have been written since Musk, the animating force behind the initiative, left the White House on less-than-amicable terms several months ago.\n\nIts official closure provides another opportunity to assess what, if any, success it had, and whether (as the Mamdani press conference might indicate) we've fully transitioned into a new phase of this second Trump administration: one interested in growing government, instead of shrinking it.\n\nGiven its quiet slide into irrelevance, it's important to remember that DOGE began as the signature initiative of the Trump White House. Its ambitious remit included closing the federal deficit, eliminating whole departments, zeroing out unauthorized regulation, and upgrading the federal government's \"tech stack.\"\n\nAs I detail in the latest issue of Reason, DOGE mostly failed at these goals.\n\nThe most glaring disparity between promises and reality was DOGE's impact on federal spending. Musk's agency went from promising potentially trillions in spending cuts to claiming hundreds of billions in savings from canceled grants and contracts.\n\nAlmost all of those cuts proved illusory. What we were left with was a small $9 billion rescission package codifying cuts to foreign aid and public broadcasting. The federal government is on track to spend more, not less, during Trump's second term.\n\nHigh hopes that DOGE would completely remake the federal government's I.T. infrastructure have also come to naught.\n\nThe Trump administration's record on deregulation is salutary. More regulatory costs are being eliminated than added, although this elimination of red tape has generally come from agencies themselves rather than DOGE specifically.\n\nThe one area where DOGE has arguably fulfilled its mission is in reducing federal headcount. While the government shutdown and consequent delay in federal jobs reporting obscure DOGE's full impact, the estimates we do have indicate a sizable drop in federal employment.\n\nThe Partnership for Public Service estimates that 211,000 civil servants (close to 10 percent of the entire federal workforce) have left federal employment via the Trump administration's workforce reduction plans.\n\nThat count includes workers let go during the shutdown, many of whom are likely to get their jobs back as a result of language included in the continuing resolution that reopened the government.\n\nYour mileage may vary on how laudatory you find his record of government cost cutting. My colleague Eric Boehm provided the \"glass half empty\" take here, which is well worth reading.\n\nI confess to looking more positively on DOGE's record. Not because I dispute any of the underlying numbers about its relatively minor impact on government operations. Rather, it's because it outperformed any expectations I had about the Trump administration's interest in cutting government at all.\n\nLibertarian Party convention speeches notwithstanding, Trump has never pitched himself as a small government champion. His record during his second term has made this abundantly clear.\n\nAs Reason's new issue on \"Republican socialism\" details, his administration is increasingly embracing big government across the board.\n\nThat includes policies one might expect from a Republican administration, like masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. It also includes any number of big government initiatives that the pre-Trump Republican party of recent memory would at least be embarrassed about—from tariffs to the government taking equity stakes in private companies.\n\nThe libertarian moment, this is not.\n\nFollowing the press conference with Mamdani, we can't even rely on Trump's reflexive anti-leftism to keep some of his administration's interfering tentacles at bay.\n\nThe socialists of all parties are finding out they actually agree on a lot.\n\nGiven the increasingly dark and interventionist trajectory of the Trump administration, it's hard not to have a little bit of nostalgia for the ever-so-brief DOGE era.\n\nFor a few short months, the White House's primary focus was on what spending could be cut and which federal workers could more productively serve their country in the private sector.\n\nIncompetent and slapdash as this effort was, it was at least stumbling in a more libertarian direction. Here was some evidence that anti-statism still had some role to play in the broader MAGA movement.\n\nWith the shuttering of DOGE now official, this transient and incomplete experiment in small government populism is definitively over. The high-water mark of what libertarians could hope for from the Trump administration has passed.\n\nPeople aren't wrong to bemoan DOGE's failures. I, for one, am still sad that it's gone. It's passing portends an even more authoritarian turn in our national politics.",

Two of the committees are unique to the Mamdani administration: the Worker Justice and Community Organizing committees.\n\n“These two committees illustrate the administration’s commitment to honoring and building upon the movement of working class New Yorkers that delivered the Mayor-elect’s historic victory,” a Mamdani transition release said.\n\nThe latter committee includes DSA member Asher Ross. Two other named DSA members, Katherine Jin and Julie Swoope, will be on the technology committee. Sebastian Leon Martinez of the Young Democratic Socialists of America will be on the Youth and Education committee.\n\nTransition Executive Director Elana Leopold said in a statement, “Excellence is the guiding light driving this transition, and today’s committee appointees are no exception. Together, these leaders will help prepare Mayor-elect Mamdani’s administration to take on the city’s toughest challenges—from housing access to emergency preparedness to the day-to-day operations of city government that must be exceptional.”\n\nThe 402 appointed members also include former New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, former Education Secretary John King, former New York City Fire Department Commissioner Daniel Nigro, former Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger, and former New York City Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot.\n\nGordillo and Mausser appear to be the first major NYC DSA appointments to the mayoral transition. Former Mayor Bill de Blasio and current Mayor Eric Adams did not have any NYC DSA leadership appointees in their transitions.\n\nMausser said last month that she does not expect to be in lockstep with Mamdani’s administration, though she will now take part in shaping it. \n\n“Of course, there will be instances where we disagree. Zohran’s administration is not the same as NYC DSA. We know that,” she told Politico. “We really want to put our energy into what we can build together with the power of a mayoral administration and the power of not only DSA but of a broad left-labor coalition.

        "text": "One of the more curious aspects within our present system of identity politics is the assumption that a person is in agreement with all of those with whom they share demographic likeness. Someone who is Muslim and also against Donald Trump, while also spouting the hope of equality and fairness for “the people” should be my cup of tea, right? Wrong.\n\nA cornerstone of democratic socialism, I suppose is the resting face of self-righteousness needled throughout any collective reallocation of wealth when it is based upon human similarity. To be sure, New York continuing to be New York is at least one of the few warm comforts left remaining to our United States. Since its inception, this city’s ethos (even when it was “Old” York in merry old England) has remained consistent: “these inhabitants are well-fit to be our servants, and they too comfortably and sit on a wealth that should be ours.” What were once the Scots to the Yorkers and Lenape to the Colonists, now we have New Yorkers to the invading throng of immigrants.\n\nOf course, of course. This nation has been built with the sweat and blood of immigrants, and New York itself has never been more than just a pinnacle of greed infecting one group after the next. Maybe the issue is the democratic socialism rhetoric bubbling up during a time of pre-imperial Trumpism? Take something’s name and separate it from its function, and you are left with a roomful of worried lobbyists. After you sort through those who are there simply for their cut, a tired, lonely mass of perpetual optimists are all that remain.\n\nDon’t blame them though. What has led to the rise of democratic socialism on the far left wing of American nonsense is partly due to the equally foul aroma of “Trump was right about everything” on the far right. As a spectator, today’s political melodrama is better than professional wrestling. However, as a citizen and a father, the continuing disagreement within our levels of governmental systems has me reaching for the history books.\n\nIf recent events have told us anything, it is that one must not put too much stock in the words uttered by an elitist speaking on behalf of the people. Though we have two seemingly different people in Zohran Mamdani and Trump, when we peel back their particular branch of used-car salesmanship, we are left with two people who lived in the half of New York reserved for the privileged. This is maybe why I still keep up with politics. It is as if the common people forget the broken promises and outright lies of our elite overlords every time one of them puts on a suit and asks us to “hope.” Though, as an epicurean and a cook, Mamdani’s election may be exactly what Greenfield needs.\n\nYears ago, a man got me into the habit of smoking cigars. Though I didn’t keep up with it, one little morsel of potential fact-hood this man left me was the events which followed Castro’s rise to power in Cuba. In short, I was told that the most talented cigar makers actually left for the Dominican Republic, and it is there that the skill of cigar-making actually continued to flourish. Perhaps this was not true, though something similar was described to me after the rise of Mao in China. Though this time dealing with martial arts, I have been advised by at least one of my Kung Fu teachers that many of the skilled practitioners fled to Taiwan after China became “Red China.” As historians and academics could debate ad infinitum as to the facts and possible realities which led to these emigrations, we have, at least, reflections of the human mind which refuses to be set to standard.\n\nWhen anything is “socialized,” it is made readily available and achievable by the meaty part of the bell curve. The drive for human excellence refuses the yoke of generality. If it didn’t, then why do the elite among us stock their refrigerators with grass-fed, raw cheddar and not with state-issued government cheese? This, my friends, is why I celebrate the election of Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York City. If this man is successful with his intended socialist policies, the world’s greatest bakers, chefs, and baristas are poised to flee to locales which have not enslaved them with regulation and mandate. I ask that the Greenfield City Council invite these future émigrés to our lovely city, if only to improve the flavor.\n\nAhmad Esfahani lives in Greenfield.",

I’m touching you. . . until the touched kid explodes. . . so the toucher can then say, look, he’s hitting me!\n\nAnd they certainly succeeded in pissing-off the president enough for Mr. Trump to suggest they could be hanged for their little prank — though he was probably incorrect about the legal niceties therein.\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe in a pensive moment\n\nThat members of the out-party in Congress and the Senate must resort to this kind of skylarking japery tells you how desperate they are. \n\nThe organizer, Minnesota Senator Elissa Slotkin, is a former CIA officer. Is she in communication regularly with any of her former colleagues at the Agency? And did she coordinate any part of her prank with them? I bet DNI Tulsi Gabbard could find out and let CIA Director John Ratcliffe know so he can fire their ass.\n\nThe intel bureaucracy remains a hotbed of resistance to the swamp-draining project underway since 01/20/25. The swamp creatures like their swamp fecund and fetid as it has been, with the rich revenue stream it is used to feeding on, and Mr. Trump has done much to change that. Alas, the CIA remains the most implacably opaque major operation in government. It insists that its activities require secrecy, and the awful downside is that the Agency has run without real oversight since its inception after the Second World War. Gawd knows how many John Brennan clones are still lodged over in the Langley, VA, HQ.\n\nOf all the celebrated new appointees in the agencies, Mr. Ratcliffe has been the least visible.\n\nHe went into the job with very promising credentials, having served as DNI in the last months of Trump 1.0. He must know where a whole lot of bodies are buried (some of them actual bodies) but the public has heard squat from him all year.\n\nSurely Mr. Ratcliffe must also know by now who in the CIA was scheming along with John Brennan to perpetrate RussiaGate, and who was on the leak-line to the news media. He must know how Adam Schiff coordinated impeachment No. 1 with CIA agent Eric Ciaramella, then Intel Inspector-General Michael Atkinson, Col. Alexander Vindman, and Lawfare ninjas Norm Eisen, Mary McCord, and Andrew Weissmann. He must know who in “Joe Biden’s” White House was coordinating the 92 felony prosecutions against Mr. Trump with DA Alvin Bragg and AG Letitia James in New York and DA Fani Willis Fulton County, GA.\n\nHe must know how BLM and Antifa were allowed to burn down Minneapolis in 2020, and riot in scores of other places. He must know what agencies and what persons in them coordinated the Covid-19 operation and which foreign entities were involved. (Was it the US military, as many suspect, and how, if at all, did freelance players such as Bill Gates and George Soros’s myriad organizations fit in the picture?) And how is the machinery of the Democratic Party entangled in the workings of US intel? (Prime suspects: Sen. Mark Warner and his staff.)\n\nYou can say much the same thing about FBI Director Kash Patel and his Deputy Director, Dan Bongino. They were apparently horrified by the rot they encountered there on taking office earlier this year. What is so difficult about firing people, even a whole lot of people? And why wouldn’t you say you are doing it? Likewise, Pam Bondi, at her resistance-infected DOJ?\n\nMy bags are packed, I’m ready to go. . . .\n\nMr. Trump had a rough week working through his “divorce” from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. Both of them behaved rather badly; he the usual name-calling; she playing up to the cluster-B ignoramouses on The View, and then resigning from Congress in a snit (walking away from Daddy). The Epstein Files legislation she was twanging on the president about got passed in a flash and signed, but it contained rules that can easily be used to keep key documents suppressed. The suspicion will linger that it’s all about protecting Israel, and thereby stir-up continued animus against the Jews.\n\nMr. Trump had a ju-jitsu session in the Oval Office with NYC mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, the avowed communist jihadi — putting the young insta-celebrity pol off-balance by acting all nice and accommodating. “I want him to do a great job. . . “ “We agree on a lot more than I would have thought. . .” “It was a great honor [to meet him]. . . .” the president declared on his Truth Social account. Stand by on what any of that means.\n\nAnd now, as we plunge into Thanksgiving week, comes the Ukraine peace proposal. Everybody knows it is a recognition that Russia is grinding toward victory in any case, and carrying-on further slaughter and destruction on-the-ground is insane. But then, Ukraine’s ruler, Mr. Zelenskyy, is insane (probably high on drugs, too), and the EU leadership is insane seeking to start a war with Russia that it has zero ability to prosecute — and nevermind whatever the obdurate defenders of the UK’s sclerotic empire think they’re doing to keep the Ukraine War going. But, bottom line: there’s a good possibility that the war will be over before Christmas, and the world will be better off for that.\n\nWith all the above going on, America needs a break. \n\nEnjoy a turkey, if you can afford to buy one, and count your blessings — for we are still a blessed people in a blessed land, and we should all show a little gratitude for the privilege of just being here on a planet so superbly suited to our needs.",

Before he could respond, Trump inserted himself.\n\n“You can just say yes, it’s easier than explaining,” Trump said at the time. \n\nIn a Sunday interview on “Meet the Press,” Mamdani affirmed to host Kristen Welker that he does indeed still think the president is a fascist.\n\n“So, Mr. Mayor-elect, just to be very clear, do you think that President Trump is a fascist?” Welker asked.\n\n“And after President Trump said that, I said, ‘Yes.’ And–,” he began before Welker cut in to ask, “So you do?”\n\n“And that’s something that I’ve said in the past. I say it today,” Mamdani answered. \n\n“And I think what I appreciated about the conversation that I had with the president was that we were not shy about the places of disagreement, about the politics that has brought us to this moment. And we also wanted to focus on what it could look like to deliver on a shared analysis of an affordable crisis for New Yorkers.”\n\nYou can watch “The Breakfast Club” segment in the video above.",

        "text": "Your suspicions about the user you're arguing with on Elon Musk's X being a fake might just be true.That's an experience that many users on X, formerly Twitter, are sharing since the platform's new \"About this account\" page went live with its \"Account based in\" feature. Basically, each X profile now discloses the country of origin a user is posting from. The feature, which X head of product Nikita Bier first teased last month, was originally rolled out on Friday night. Hours later, X removed the feature with Bier claiming there were some changes that needed to be made to address users that utilized VPNs to hide their location. However, by Saturday night, X had once again made the country of origin feature live for each account.\n\n X's location revealing feature is live. Here's how to make it less precise.\n\nThere are ways to obscure your location in X's settings. Users can choose to only show a general region like North America or Europe instead of the specific nation like the United States or Germany. While this might protect users who are afraid of being doxxed or need to be more private living under an oppressive regime of a more authoritarian country, these settings don't really affect how fake accounts are revealed.For example, X users discovered that the account @American, complete with a U.S. flag and bald eagle in their avatar, was not in fact a user from the United States but someone posting from \"South Asia.\"\n\n This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n\nAnother account called \"Mariana Times\" presented themselves as a U.S. citizen who spoke out about wanting to deport New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani because \"we want a nation\" and not \"foreigner\" who has not \"assimilated into American culture.\" While their avatar had an Israeli flag with an AI-looking woman standing in front of it, X's new feature revealed that Mariana is actually posting from India.\n\n This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n\nMany social media users have long wondered if foreign actors have been behind prominent anonymous political accounts that use the platform to sow discord or even just make easy money through monetization schemes. It's unclear just how large the scale is, but X's new location feature certainly confirmed the suspicion that this is happening.In addition, it shows that Elon Musk's goal to \"defeat the bots\" on X has largely been a failure. In fact, studies have shown that the bot and fake account problem on X has been even worse since Musk took over and made changes to the platform that made it easier for these type of fake accounts to prevail.However, with X's latest change, spearheaded by the newly-hired Bier, at least users will now get a good idea if they are arguing with one of these fake accounts. And more transparency is always a good thing.So, that \"Make America Great Again\" themed account that you've been duking it out with online for years? You may just now find out that the user claiming to be from the U.S. is actually from Russia, Nigeria, India, or elsewhere.\n\n This Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\n\n let cbeScripts = {\"twitterEmbed\":[\"https:\\/\\/platform.twitter.com\\/widgets.js\"]};\n let cbeScriptObserver = function (nodeType, scriptsArr) {\n let firstElem = document.querySelector('.' + nodeType)\n let self = this\n\n if (firstElem == null) {\n console.warn(`CBE cannot find element with class .${nodeType} for script observer.`)\n\n scriptsArr.forEach((scriptSrc) => {\n const linkEl = document.createElement('link')\n linkEl.rel = 'dns-prefetch'\n linkEl.href = scriptSrc\n document.head.append(linkEl)\n\n window[nodeType + 'Loaded'] = false\n\n this.embedObserver = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {\n entries.forEach((entry) => {\n if (entry.isIntersecting && window[nodeType + 'Loaded'] === false) {\n scriptsArr.forEach((scriptSrc) => {\n const el = document.createElement('script')\n el.src = scriptSrc\n el.async = true\n document.head.append(el);\n\n window[nodeType + 'Loaded'] = true\n self.embedObserver.disconnect()\n\n }, {root: null, rootMargin: '750px'})\n this.embedObserver.observe(firstElem)\n\n for (const item in cbeScripts) {\n new cbeScriptObserver(item, cbeScripts[item])",

        "text": "Shoppers plan to cut back their spending during the crucial Black Friday weekend for the first time in four years — the latest sign of mounting affordability concerns in the US, according to a survey.\n\nThose who plan to shop during the busy Black Friday and Cyber Monday events expect to spend an average of $622 – roughly 4% less than last year, according to a Deloitte survey of 1,200 US consumers.\n\nThe trend is hitting consumers on both ends of the income spectrum.\n\nShoppers making less than $50,000 a year are expected to spend 12% less than last year, while those earning more than $200,000 plan to cut spending by 18%, according to the survey.\n\nOf those who plan to spend less, 69% cited higher costs of living while 43% blamed financial constraints, according to the survey conducted between Oct. 15 and Oct. 23.\n\nIt’s a sharp turnaround in the survey’s findings. For the past four years straight, shoppers had said they planned to spend more than the previous year, according to the survey.\n\nIn another sign that shoppers are growing antsy over the economy, more consumers are expected to hunt for discounts and deals this year during the hectic Nov. 27 to Dec. 1 shopping period.\n\nAbout 82% of respondents said they plan to shop during the weekend, up from 79% in 2024, according to Deloitte.\n\nAs retailers offer fewer discounts and high-price holiday items lead to sticker shock, nearly two-thirds of shoppers are planning to use financing options – like credit cards or buy now, pay later apps – to stretch their budgets, according to the survey. \n\nBNPL options – including apps like Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm – allow shoppers to make a purchase and pay it off over time in installments, usually with no interest.\n\nYoung shoppers have taken advantage of these apps, with 39% of Gen Zers and millennials planning to use BNPL options to fund their Black Friday hauls, according to Deloitte.\n\nExperts have warned the popular payment options could lead shoppers to overspend and slip into debt.\n\nAmericans are not expecting relief anytime soon, expecting inflation to hit 4.5% by next year, according to the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey.\n\n“This season, consumers are eager to find the best deals to wrap up their holiday shopping. They have made their gift lists and are checking Black Friday-Cyber Monday promotions to stretch their budgets,” Natalie Martini, vice chair and leader of US Retail and Consumer Products at Deloitte, said in a statement. \n\n“While we expect shoppers to plan to pull back on spending, we also anticipate strong participation throughout the holiday week, with many planning to blend the convenience of online shopping with the energy of the in-store experience.”\n\nThe monthly consumer sentiment reading dropped to 50.3 earlier this month – the lowest level in more than three years and near the worst-ever figure, according to the survey.\n\nConcerns around affordability and sky-high costs propelled Dems like socialist NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani to victory earlier this month.\n\nThat has pushed President Trump to double down on his affordability agenda. \n\nHe has vowed to send $2,000 checks to most Americans before the 2026 midterms and slashed tariffs on staple food items like bananas and coffee.\n\nMeanwhile, inflation has heated up to 3% as of September – the fastest rate since January, according to the most recently available Consumer Price Index.\n\nThe labor market is still showing signs of weakness, too. \n\nWhile US employers added a better-than-expected 119,000 jobs in September, the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4% – its highest level since October 2021, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",

        "text": "Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts made a surprising announcement last month: The moderate Democrat said he would no longer accept donations from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).\n\nSpurning AIPAC was not, on its face, shocking. In the more than two years since Israel’s onslaught in Gaza began, numerous members of Congress have pledged not to accept money from the lobby, all from the more progressive wing of the Democratic Party. But for Moulton, who leans heavily on his background as a Marine who served multiple tours in Iraq, to join that cohort was surprising. Now gearing up for a potentially bruising primary as he challenges progressive stalwart Ed Markey for his Senate seat, Moulton apparently decided that turning his back on AIPAC and its allies was more politically advantageous than costly.\n\nThe growing list of members of Congress rejecting funding from AIPAC and other pro-Israel groups marks a stark turnaround from the primacy those organizations recently held in the halls of power.\n\nFor decades, AIPAC focused entirely on lobbying members of Congress and did not directly support individual candidates. That changed in 2021, when AIPAC launched several Political Action Committees (PACs) expressly designed to help pro-Israel candidates win their races. These PACs — the awkwardly named AIPAC PAC and the AIPAC-affiliated Super PAC, United Democracy Project — quickly became major players in the national political scene. They were soon joined by other pro-Israel PACs, most prominently Democratic Majority for Israel, whose leadership was closely aligned with AIPAC.\n\nIn 2022, these groups spent nearly $60 million in direct support or on behalf of candidates, placing AIPAC and its affiliates among the top 10 spenders that cycle. Among their targets was Michigan Rep. Andy Levin, a Jewish member of Congress and president of his synagogue. After 2020 redistricting that merged Levin’s district with that of another Democrat, Haley Stevens, the two faced off in the Democratic primary. AIPAC and its allies, apparently upset over Levin’s critique of Israel’s illegal annexation of Palestinian territory, poured more than $4 million into backing Stevens, who won the nomination handily.\n\nIn 2024, AIPAC’s reach broadened further. In the first major election cycle after October 7, AIPAC targeted some of Israel’s harshest critics in Congress, spending heavily to unseat progressives like Cori Bush and Jamaal Bowman. It spent a “record-shattering” $14.5 million to support George Latimer against Bowman, and another $8.5 million in St. Louis in support of Wesley Bell against Bush. Both Bowman and Bush were defeated. (The AIPAC watchdog site Track AIPAC rates Bell and Latimer as the top all-time recipients of AIPAC donations.)\n\nBy the end of the primary season, progressives and critics of Israel’s Gaza policy were publicly despairing. Bernie Sanders warned that AIPAC’s success would embolden the lobby to suppress critical voices wherever it found them.\n\nThen, something shifted. As Israel’s assault ground on, public sentiment on Israel-Palestine began to fracture. Surveys in mid-2024 showed clear divides in American opinion, with younger people and Democrats increasingly saying the Biden administration was too favorable toward Israel. Within the Democratic Party, these splits were even sharper: Nearly 50 percent of Democrats aged 18–29 said they sympathized more with Palestinians, compared with only 17 percent of those over 65.\n\nThese intraparty tensions were amplified by the Uncommitted movement, which urged Democratic voters in key states to select “uncommitted” during the party’s primary to protest the administration’s stance. In swing-state Michigan, the movement garnered more than 100,000 votes. Rifts deepened further when Democratic National Convention organizers denied speaking time to Ruwa Romman, a Palestinian-American Georgia House Representative recommended by the movement.\n\nMeanwhile, coalitions like Reject AIPAC pressed members of Congress to declare they would refuse AIPAC’s funding. By late 2024, with Kamala Harris facing Donald Trump in the general election, the Biden administration’s unqualified support for Israel had become a top issue. Harris, unwilling or unable to distance herself from Biden’s legacy, gave voters little reason to expect a shift in policy.\n\nUltimately, Harris hemorrhaged support among constituencies crucial to Biden’s 2020 win. Her backing among voters aged 18 to 49 dropped by 10 points from Biden’s 17-point margin in 2020. A pre-election analysis also showed that her support among Muslim voters lagged far behind Biden’s. In swing states like Michigan — where Harris lost by just over 80,000 votes — the significance of the more than 100,000 Uncommitted primary voters in that state was impossible to ignore. While the Uncommitted movement had aimed to serve as a warning to Democrats about the electoral liabilities of its Gaza policy via mounting a protest in the Democratic primaries, it had now become a grim predictor of Democrats’ weakness in the general election.\n\nNow, still reeling from their 2024 wipeout, and with Democratic support for Israel continuing to crater through 2025, the party finds itself at a crossroads. Many Democrats have decided that the electoral risks of taking AIPAC money now outweigh the benefits.\n\nMoulton is just one striking example of how quickly the tide is turning. Recently, former Missouri Rep. Cori Bush announced she would run again for her old seat, directly challenging the AIPAC-backed candidate Bell who unseated her last year. That Bush is mounting a comeback so quickly underscores how rapidly Bell’s close ties to the pro-Israel lobby have shifted from a strength to a liability.\n\nThis pattern is emerging elsewhere as well. In New York City, where Zohran Mamdani won the mayorship thanks in part to his support for Palestinian rights, progressives are eyeing multiple congressional seats — including that of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries — for primary challenges. Many of the representatives currently holding these seats — including Jeffries, Dan Goldman, and Ritchie Torres — are well-known for their close ties to the pro-Israel lobby. Torres, for example, has sponsored bills in Congress that lean heavily into AIPAC-promoted narratives about antisemitism on college campuses. He has also gained a reputation as one of the most ardent defender of Israel’s actions in Gaza on social media. Goldman, meanwhile, has been one of the most unwavering voices in supporting Israel’s “right to defend itself.”\n\nProgressives are betting that these affiliations, plus general outrage with mainstream Democrats’ feeble response to the Trump administration, will propel progressive challengers to victory.\n\nWith such a dramatic swing of the pendulum, the ball now appears to be back in AIPAC’s court. After funding the two most expensive Democratic primaries in history in 2024, AIPAC and its allies are likely to enter the 2026 cycle with ample resources. Whether the same scorched-earth spending strategy remains politically viable is unclear. The lobby will undoubtedly work to defend its closest allies and beat back challengers like Bush and the New York progressives. But it will have to consider how visibly it operates. Its reputation took another hit after Zohran Mamdani defeated Andrew Cuomo — twice — despite Cuomo’s vocal backing from pro-Israel billionaires and donors tied to Donald Trump, many of whom tried to make Mamdani’s criticism of Israel a central campaign issue.\n\nThis does not, of course, mean that AIPAC will relent in its quest to influence electoral outcomes within the Democratic primary. It does mean, however, that it may have to go to lengths to either obscure or downplay its role in campaign contributions and independent expenditures on behalf of candidates.\n\nAIPAC and its affiliates have long obscured their actual gripes with candidates they oppose in political advertising — their stances on Israel — instead focusing on those candidates’ stances on controversial domestic policies. They may push this trend further in coming cycles, making it harder for the average voter to determine when they’re subjected to messaging from the pro-Israel lobby.\n\nWhether this will be an effective adjustment in its strategy remains to be seen. As the political landscape continues to shift, the coming cycles may determine whether AIPAC can retain its once-unassailable influence — or whether rising skepticism of U.S. support for Israel signals a lasting realignment among Democrats.",

While Nikki, whose parents are Indian immigrants, has supported legal pathways to the United States, Nalin told the British news site UnHerd earlier this month, “I think we need to stop legal immigration.” Last week, he also wrote on X that the U.S. should “end H1-B visas.”\n\nJust last week, Nalin argued in an interview with Tucker Carlson that naturalized citizens—such as New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani—should be barred from holding public office.\n\nNikki has been a fierce advocate for Israel, while Nalin told UnHerd that “Israel is just another country” and that it needs to stop “interfering in our politics.”\n\nNikki told the Journal she was “proud of the strong, intelligent people” Nalin and his 27-year-old sister Rena have become. “Our goal was to teach our children to have a deep faith, a strong work ethic and to think for themselves,” she said.\n\nResearch over decades has shown that the vast majority of American families pass on their political loyalties. A 2023 Pew Research Center survey found that eight in ten parents who were Republican or leaned Republican (81 percent) had teens who also identified as or leaned Republican. And about nine-in-ten Democratic or Democratic-leaning parents (89 percent) had teens aligned 9-in-10 Democratic or Democratic-leaning parents (89 percent) had teens aligned with them. \n\nBut Nalin’s divergence from his mother’s politics is far from the only break within a prominent political family in recent years.\n\nFormer Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway dominated headlines in 2020 as her daughter Claudia amassed millions of views on TikTok as a 15-year-old, slamming her mother’s politics and declaring she was seeking emancipation after learning Kellyanne would speak at the Republican National Convention. Kellyanne eventually resigned from the White House to focus on her “beloved children.”\n\nThe Kennedy family has long condemned the appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary. His sister, Kerry Kennedy, and his nephew, Joe Kennedy III, publicly called for his resignation after RFK Jr.’s disastrous September hearing before the U.S. Senate. Just this weekend, John F. Kennedy’s granddaughter Tatiana Schlossberg admonished Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in an essay revealing that she has less than a year to live following a terminal cancer diagnosis.\n\nTop Trump aide Stephen Miller is also no stranger to family estrangement. Last month, his first cousin publicly disowned him for becoming “the face of evil” as the architect of the Trump administration’s hardline immigration crackdown. And in 2018, his uncle David Glosser penned a scathing essay for Politico in which he described Miller as an “immigration hypocrite.”",

And then there’ll be more investment because we have all the pro-growth policies and tax policies that will allow the job creators, entrepreneurs, risk-takers, innovators to do what they do.”\n\n“Everything I just described will happen in due time, and it will,” he added. “So we’re very bullish about it.”\n\nDemocrats have attempted to capitalize on affordability matters in recent elections, using the topic to try to spur momentum in future campaigns. \n\nIn New York City, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani secured victory after building a sweeping movement focused on cost-of-living concerns.\n\nIn response, Trump has tried to frame the GOP as the “party of affordability,” arguing that Democrats created an economic crisis during the Biden years and that his White House is “relentlessly” focused on resolving concerns.\n\n“Affordable” should be “our word, not theirs,” Trump said during a speech last week at McDonald’s Impact Summit. He added that his administration has it “down to a low level, but we’re going to get it a little bit lower.”\n\n“We want perfection,” Trump said. “Because the Democrats got up and took affordability, affordability, and they don’t say that they had the worst inflation in history, the highest energy prices in history. Everything was the worst. What they’re great at is lying. They say affordability. This stuff was all much more expensive.”",

        "text": "How did a 34-year-old democratic socialist become the mayor of the city that built Wall Street? New York, the global hub of capitalism, just handed the keys to City Hall to Zohran Mamdani, a young politician whose platform promises to reshape the most powerful financial city on Earth. It's an extraordinary experiment. Can socialism coexist within the beating heart of global finance?I have lived and worked for over three decades in the world of finance and capital markets in New York and have seen cycles come and go, from the near-collapse of the early 1990s to the Great Financial Crisis, and the COVID shock that emptied Manhattan's streets. Yet this moment feels different. Mamdani's election is a symptom of a deeper, global frustration.New Yorkers are angry, and many are desperate. The affordability crisis has reached a breaking point. Renters are spending half their income on housing, grocery bills have soared, and young professionals, burdened with student debt, are living in overcrowded small apartments. Mamdani tapped into that pain with political precision. He promised relief: rent freezes, free public transit, universal childcare, a $30 minimum wage, and a more humane approach to policing. His message struck a nerve that crossed boroughs and generations.But the math behind those promises is far less romantic. Mamdani's central fiscal plan to \"tax the rich\" plays well at rallies, but the numbers tell a different story. In New York, the top 1% of earners contribute nearly half of all personal income tax revenue. Push that group too far, and they'll take their companies, their investments, and their employees elsewhere. Florida and Texas are already rolling out the red carpet for high earners leaving high-tax states. Once that capital leaves, it's almost impossible to bring it back.Municipal budgets are not abstract. They pay teachers, firefighters, subway repairs, and hospitals. Dramatic tax hikes or policies that disincentivize private investment risk slower hiring, lower property values, deferred projects, and fewer philanthropic dollars. Some insist that bold redistribution and aggressive reforms are both morally urgent and politically feasible. Others argue that limitless taxes will trigger a capital flight away from New York. Both positions have merit in theory, and both fail if they don't consider the broader picture. The question is how to pay for it without hollowing out the city's revenue base.New York has been here before: battered, bruised, and reborn. In the mid-1970s, the city teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, and only through wrenching compromises between public institutions and private markets did it survive. Those years taught the city a hard lesson. Institutions and markets matter, and once capital flees, recovery is long and painful. Municipal finances are fragile, but the resilience of citizens and infrastructure is remarkable when properly supported.If bold experiments are pursued without credible fiscal planning, the city faces immediate risks: rising crime, falling tourism, businesses relocating, and a weakened tax base that could take decades to rebuild. Think of New York as a complex machine: remove the lubrication of capital and confidence, and the gears seize. Conversely, when private capital and public purpose align, the city hums. Jobs are created, rents stabilize, and civic institutions thrive.The winning playbook is pragmatic partnership: target aid to the truly needy, invest in housing supply and affordability, and design revenue measures that broaden rather than chase away the base. Reforms must include measurable outcomes and replacement investments, not mere budget cuts or new taxes.If the mayor successfully builds coalitions across business and labor, and presents a clear fiscal plan balancing compassion with competitiveness, New York will adapt once more. I am betting on resilience. New Yorkers are stubbornly durable, but resilience alone will not save us if the city's economic engine is dismantled. The real test is creating an environment where idealism can coexist with capitalism. For this experiment to work, socialism must find a way to work with capitalism to create a better New York, for all New Yorkers.About the AuthorEdward L.

        "text": "Donald Trump and Zohran Mamdani’s meeting last week has been making headlines, and how even now. Trump was full of praise for the NYC mayor-elect during his briefing with the press. Now, the two have been occupying headline space for their similar outfit choices.\n\nIt started with a viral clip of Donald Trump interacting with the media recently. In the video, Trump is seen ditching his signature style – with suits and ties – and is dressed like Zohran Mamdani. The 34-year-old leader’s signature style is all about turtlenecks and blazers and Trump is seen donning one in the video.\n\nAn X user shared a clip on the social media platform, which features Trump dressed in a maroon turtleneck and a black blazer. Drawing a line from Trump’s new style to that of Mamdani’s signature one, the X user wrote, “He meets with Mamdani one time and immediately tries to step his swag up.”\n\nHe meets with Mamdani one time and immediately tries to step his swag up https://t.co/5vScvSvqrG\n— Ahmed Baba (@AhmedBaba_) November 22, 2025\n\nThe Internet couldn’t help but notice the stark similarities in the two styles. “I gotta one up Mamdani charm offensive,” read a comment. “He’s tucking his chin flaps into his turtleneck like a muffin top in a pair of high-waisted jeans,” read another one. Another user added, “Man woke up and said, make drip great again.”\n\nSimilar thoughts echoed in the comments section. “That fit, though iconic in a very confusing way,” a netizen commented. Another one wrote, “Haha he got so impressed by Mamdani.” Another X user jokingly wrote, “Mamdani actually recommended this in his meeting with Trump.”\n\nThe picture that originally started the conversation was this one. The post featured a picture collage of a recent photograph of Trump, juxtaposed with a relatively old click of Mamdani. The two can be seen twinning in the picture. However, the photo on the right is a tweaked version. The original click actually features Mamdani dressed in a grey turtleneck, not red.\n\nBREAKING: Trump COPIES Mamdani’s outfit.\nWho wrote it BETTER? pic.twitter.com/n1HlmIz32G\n— Spencer Hakimian (@SpencerHakimian) November 23, 2025\n\nMeanwhile, a section of the Internet went on to troll Trump. “Those colors don’t really look good with orange,” an X user wrote. “Sincerest form of flattery,” read a second comment. “Trump wants to look like a Socialist because he thinks he can save NY votes. Hey, Dozy Don, it isn’t going to work,” read a third.\n\nSome netizens even dug out old pictures of Barack Obama and claimed that the former President pulled off that look first when he showed up at the National Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony back in 2011.\n\nAfter conducting his meeting with Mamdani last week, Trump said, “We’ve just had a great meeting—a really good, very productive meeting.” “We had a meeting today that actually surprised me. He wants to see no crime. He wants to see housing being built. He wants to see rents coming down. All things that I agree with,” Trump said on Friday.\n\nThe President was all praises for Mamdani, and he said, “I expect to be helping him, not hurting him — a big help, because I want New York City to be great. I think he wants to make it greater than ever before, and if he can, we’ll be out there cheering. I’ll be cheering for him.”\n\nAs for Mamdani, this is what he had to say about Trump post the meeting last week at the Oval Office, “I appreciated the time with the president. I appreciated your conversation. We are very clear about our positions and our views, and what I really appreciate about the president is the meeting that we had focused not on places of disagreement, of which there are many, but instead focused on the shared purpose that we have in serving New Yorkers.”",

        "text": "On Friday, President Donald Trump welcomed New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, to The White House. The sitting president didn’t call the incoming mayor of America’s biggest city a communist or any other previously used insult. The two leaders were respectful, some might say even optimistic. The future of the country does not appear as divided as it did even months before.\n\nHours later, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a MAGA stalwart, announced her upcoming resignation from the House. The firebrand has seemingly curbed her language towards the other, offering those who both agreed with her conspiracy theories and loathed her stances a chance to bring down the temperature. Partly due to her persistence, the release of the Epstein files became a bipartisan issue, as did the looming expiration of pandemic-era Affordable Care Act subsidies. The future of the country does not appear as divided as it did even months before.\n\nOnly time will tell which news will be more impactful. But both of these stories may have offered an off ramp to identity politics.It’s fair to say Greene once represented the extreme of the GOP. Gaining nationwide notoriety for peddling conspiracies and elevating QAnon, she was once a pariah on nationwide media and extremely popular in her district. \n\nFive years after winning her seat, she’s stepping down while apologizing for raising the temperature, appearing like a pretty mainstream politician on pretty mainstream daytime talk shows like The View. \n\nLike I’ve pointed out before, most of Greene’s views haven’t exactly changed. But the rhetoric definitely has. And the rhetoric had been pretty consistent since the current sitting president rode a golden elevator down to announce his official bid for his first term.Some pundits are positing all of this just means she’s running for statewide office, or maybe even running for president. Great. \n\nIf that is the case, it’s an even bigger example of the beginning of the end of identity politics. If conspiracy theories and hateful rhetoric work in fewer congressional districts and other areas, that’s a larger sign it’s ending. Motivations may mean something in a court of law, but not when it comes to actually changing opinions. \n\nIt’s fair to say Mamdani has been portrayed by some media ecosystems as the extreme left. A young politician unafraid of embracing the boogeyman-inducing word socialist, Mamdani went from unknown politician polling at single digits to winning a more than a 50 percent of votes in a three-way mayoral race. \n\nHe didn’t win that race simply because he was the only democratic socialist on the ticket; he won because he championed some common-sense issues. (It’s the economy, stupid). \n\nSimilar to Greene, Mamdani embraced some of the same issues that helped Trump win over 30 percent of NYC voters in 2024. Like Mamdani said in the White House on Friday, “When we spoke to those voters who voted for President Trump, we heard them speak about cost of living. We focused on that same cost of living. And that’s where I am really looking forward to delivering for New Yorkers in partnership with the President on the affordability agenda.” (It’s the economy, stupid.)The biggest surprise on Friday wasn’t Greene’s resignation video. \n\nOr Mamdani and Trump’s meet-cute. \n\nOr Trump posing in front of a portrait of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. \n\nOr Trump being cool with Mamdani calling him a fascist. \n\nThe long-term takeaway came early in their shared remarks to the assembled press. \n\nThat was when Trump said, “I think you’re going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor. The better he does, the happier I am, I will say. There’s no difference in party. There’s no difference in anything. And we’re going to be helping him to make everybody’s dream come true, having a strong and very safe New York. And congratulations, Mr. Mayor.”\n\nOnce again: “There’s no difference in party. There’s no difference in anything.” Is this the moment we will identify as the beginning of the end of identity politics? One meeting and one resignation video does not dismiss the enormity of the actual actions of any politician last week. \n\nDuring the same week Trump buddied up to his new favorite New Yorker, he dismissed the brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi, gave Ukraine less than a week to accept a proposal that favors Russia to end the war that Russia started, called a reporter “piggy” and welcomed back to the White House the man who slashed hundreds of thousands of federal jobs, Elon Musk. \n\nWe are still not living in an era of civility. \n\nBut when three of the most important names in the game, from vastly divergent political backgrounds, are willingly cooling things down, it does appear that there’s now an off-ramp for some of the most heated partisanship. \n\nReality check: If Trump and Greene were to step back from their long-standing claims that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, that would be evidence of a huge step. \n\nNevertheless, last week’s baby steps are still progress.",

That hurts, right? \"Surprisingly for me, doesn't hurt really much,\" Holsinger replied. \"I have had times where I've lost, for example, like, $6,000 on a bad trade, but also the inverse of that; I've made $11,000 on a trade, and so, you know, it's just ups-and-downs.\" The live streaming influencer is one of millions of people flocking to prediction markets like Kalshi, PredictIt and Polymarket where you can wager on just about anything.Tarek Mansour and Luana Lopes Lara are former Wall Street traders-turned-co-founders of Kalshi. \"A prediction market is like the stock market, but instead of buying and selling companies, you're buying 'yes' and 'no' on whether something is going to happen or not,\" Mansour said. \"So, it could be whether Mamdani was going to win the last New York mayor's race, or there's going to be a hurricane in Florida next month.\"Lopes Lara said, \"People can make money on what they know, actually monetize their knowledge, monetize their hobby, because everyone is an expert on something.\" Kalshi made a name for itself in the 2024 election. The presidential race looked close, unless you were keeping an eye on Kalshi, which called the race well before the TV networks did. \"It was like Kalshi, then Fox, then CNN,\" said Mansour. \"It was crazy.\"Twelve months later, Kalshi was the talk of another election: The New York City mayor's race. As Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani told the crowd on Oct. 26, \"You see the Kalshi odds that have our chances of victory in the 90s.\"Kalshi's numbers are not polling data; they represent what people think is going to happen. \"It's people putting money on what they think is going to happen, and then the wisdom of the crowds in the markets come up with the probabilities of who is going to win,\" said Lopes Lara.And you can bet on (or Kalshi says \"invest in\") more than 3,500 markets on the company's platform, like who will be a bridesmaid in Taylor Swift's wedding. I asked, \"How do I know that someone close to Taylor Swift, or Taylor Swift herself, isn't participating in a way that will make her outcome more favorable and let her, you know, take home a little extra cash?\"Lopes Lara replied, \"Kalshi is a federally-regulated, fully-compliant exchange, and we have systems in place to monitor for any suspicious or unusual activity. We also have a lot of trading prohibitions in place.\"According to Mansour, \"There really hasn't been any issues.\" Prediction markets are booming. The owner of the New York Stock Exchange is investing $2 billion in Polymarket, and the sports betting platform FanDuel will launch its own prediction market next month.In fact, when it's not an election, the majority of the money traded on Kalshi is not on politics or culture – it's on sports. Jonathan Cohen, author of \"Losing Big,\" has chronicled the rise of sports betting in the U.S. Regarding Kalshi, he said, \"You can bet on things that a traditional Sportsbook would offer you.\"\"Kalshi says this is an investment. You don't buy that?\"\"No,\" said Cohen. \"The New England Patriots are not more likely to win their game because I bought a contract for them to win the game. It is a speculative instrument purely for my own use and my own entertainment, which to me qualifies it as gambling rather than investing.\"But Kalshi is not regulated like gambling. Online sports betting is only legal in 31 states; Kalshi is available in all 50. The Biden administration tried to prevent Kalshi from offering sports markets. Then, when President Trump returned to the White House, his administration vowed to break with \"past hostility\" – and earlier this year, the president's son, Donald Jr, became a strategic advisor to both Kalshi and its main rival, Polymarket. Asked why Kalshi made Donald Trump Jr. a strategic advisor, Mansour replied, \"We have a lot of advisors, um, and they span across the board, across different functions. But really, this is all about growing this industry, the prediction market industry, that a lot of people really believe in.\"I asked, \"What kind of advice does he give you?\"\"So, it really is, again, about growing prediction markets,\" Mansour said. \"You know, he believes in prediction markets. We believe in prediction markets. A lot of people believe in prediction markets, and it's really about go-to-market and expansion plans.\"\"Does he come to meetings? How much do you pay him? What's his role? I mean, this is the son of the president.\"\"We, again, I mean, we have a lot of advisors,\" Mansour replied. \"And whether it's our investors, whether it's, uh, people that we really trust and respect, whether – \"\"But he's not just any advisor; he has a direct line to the White House,\" I said. \"We have a lot of advisors,\" said Mansour. Kalshi is embroiled in legal battles with several states, like Massachusetts, that say Kalshi's sports markets amount to \"unlawful sports wagering.\"Are the states wrong? \"We are confident in what we're doing,\" said Mansour. \"We're confident in our position from the law, and we're also confident in the fact that, you know, customers are actually finding a lot of value in basically what we're offering. So, I would say yes.\"But for now, if you are over the age of 18, you can bet on just about anything, anywhere, any time. Cohen said, \"It's not enough to, like, like Taylor Swift anymore. You have to use your knowledge of Taylor Swift to, like, try to make money off of how many streams she's going to get in a month. Or it's not enough to, I don't know, even like politics anymore; you have to gamble on politics. You have to make money on politics.\"That, to me, it seems like sort of the canary in the coal mine of like a 'gamblification' of American culture that I think is sort of still on the rise,\" he said, \"and we might not like what that looks like when it fully arrives.\" For more info:Kalshi\"Losing Big: America's Reckless Bet on Sports Gambling\" by Jonathan D.

        "text": "Sunny Hostin believes that Zohran Mamdani successfully “played” Donald Trump during his recent visit to the White House. \n\n The legal expert weighed in on the unexpectedly friendly meeting between New York City’s mayor-elect and the president on Monday’s episode of The View. \n\n “Mamdani played him like a New Yorker would play anybody,” Hostin said. “That’s the bottom line. New Yorkers, we’re a special breed of people, okay? I’m from the Bronx. He lived in Queens. He went to school in the Bronx. Game knows game.” \n\n The cohost explained that Mamdani won over Trump by speaking his language. \n\n “He talked about housing, he talked about building housing, affordability, let’s face it, Trump wants a bit of the New York housing business,” she added. “This was about business. Mamdani, we’ve gotta give it to him — he played it like a politician.”\n\n After months of exchanging barbs in the lead-up to the New York City mayoral election, Mamdani and Trump appeared to be in good standing when the mayor-elect visited the White House on Nov. 21. \n\n During their meeting, Trump waved off Mamdani’s previous insults about him when brought up by reporters and described the 34-year-old Democratic Socialist as a “very rational person” who “wants to see New York be great again,” the Associated Press reports. The president added, “I want him to do a great job and will help him do a great job.” \n\n Mamdani, in turn, noted that he and Trump both ran their recent political campaigns on the importance of affordability. Trump also acknowledged the common ground between them, adding, “We had some interesting conversations and some of his ideas are the same that I have.” \n\n Get your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter.\n\n Speaking on The View, Ana Navarro noted that, despite living in Florida, Trump is and always has been a New Yorker at heart. \n\n “His name is all over this city. His friends are all from New York. This is where he has spent most of his adult life,” she said, with Joy Behar stating, “He got 24 percent of the vote.”\n\n Alyssa Farah Griffin added that the meeting showcased how “the populist left and the populist right overlap” on a lot more issues than either side would expect. \n\n “Those of us who are not Democratic Socialists or far right, alt-right MAGA types are like, ‘I’m sorry, someone please represent us,’” she said. “And it’s neither of these.”\n\n Earlier in the segment, Behar said that Trump has always wanted the \"love of New York\" and its people.\n\n “He grew up in Queens, the Manhattanites always rejected him, they thought he was trashy, whatever they said, and he wants it so badly,\" she said. \"So that’s to our advantage in New York, maybe, because we need the money from the federal government.” \n\n The View airs weekdays on ABC.",

        "text": "Good news! First Elphaba and Glinda patched things up, and now Jerry O'Connell and John Stamos' years-long feud is over.\n\n Two years after O'Connell publicly declared that he wouldn't read Stamos' memoir, If You Would Have Told Me, in which the Full House alum makes some choice comments about his 2005 divorce from Rebecca Romijn — whom O'Connell married in 2007 — the duo has seemingly made amends. At least enough to pose for a selfie together.\n\n On Saturday, The Talk alum shared a smiling selfie with Stamos and his wife Caitlin McHugh at Howie Mandel's 70th birthday celebration.\n\n \"First @zohrankmamdani and @realdonaldtrump,\" O'Connell captioned the Instagram post, referencing the recent meeting between New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and President Donald Trump. \"Then me and @johnstamos.\"\n\n Political quips aside, O'Connell shared kind words for the couple, adding, \"Gorgeous fam and gorgeous people @johnstamos & @caitlinskybound.\"\n\n Mandel was more than happy to take credit for the reconciliation. \"This is what I do,\" the America's Got Talent judge quipped in the comments. \"I bring people together. You're welcome.\"\n\n Stamos published his memoir in October 2023, in which he addresses both the highs and lows of his career and personal life, including his divorce from Rebecca Romijn, to whom he was married from 1998 to 2005, and his long road to sobriety, which began with his DUI arrest in 2015.\n\n In a conversation with PEOPLE at the time, Stamos said the divorce \"shattered\" him. \"In my mind back then, she was the devil, and I just hated her,\" he said. \"I couldn't believe how much I hated her, and it ruined my life.\" He eventually recognized that he played \"some part\" in the split. \"You start thinking, 'She wasn't the devil. Maybe I was as much to blame as her.'\"\n\n But O'Connell had no interest in Stamos' realization. During an appearance on Andy Cohen's SirusXM radio show in November 2023, he told Cohen that he and Romijn don't have \"any interest\" in diving into the memoir especially after learning the book accuses Romijn of cheating during their relationship and Stamos spoke about how he felt \"emasculated\" during his marriage to Romijn in an interview with Howard Stern.\n\n O'Connell noted that it got \"awkward\" with his twin daughters with Romjin. \"My children are 14 and they see what we see now,\" O'Connell said at the time. \"There's no hiding, there's no more keeping things from them. It's pretty crazy when your kids come out for breakfast and go, 'Hey mom, your ex has a book out and called you the devil. What are your thoughts?'\"\n\n In Stamos' interview with Stern, the actor spoke about how he struggled with Romijn's rising fame during their marriage. \"I think that she outgrew me,\" he said, acknowledging that he should've tried harder to save the marriage. \"I didn't work as hard as I should at anything.\"\n\n As for the Star Trek: Strange New Worlds star's thoughts, she shared her perspective with Entertainment Tonight in January 2024. The actress confessed that she was \"blindsided\" by Stamos' book.\n\n \"I was very surprised by all of that, incredibly shocked actually,\" Romijn said. \"But, you know, I don't really want to help him sell his books based on those headlines. So that's all I really want to say about it.\"\n\n Get your daily dose of entertainment news, celebrity updates, and what to watch with our EW Dispatch newsletter.\n\n Romijn and O'Connell met at the Maxim Hot 100 bash in 2004 and married three years later. Their twin daughters were born December 2008.\n\n Stamos married McHugh in February 2018, two months before they welcomed their son, Billy, 7.",

        "text": "The campaign firm that helped Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani spread his message in New York City is now turning its focus to vulnerable Republicans across the country. Among other races, the firm has set its sights on defeating two vulnerable House Republicans in Pennsylvania: Reps. Rob Bresnahan and Ryan Mackenzie. Fight Agency — a six-man crew with experience in over 300 winning elections — focuses on many of the issues Mamdani made a fixture of his campaign, like affordability and housing. \"If you're doing everything right but finding it harder and harder to get by, you're not alone. We know a simple truth about American life: the economy is not delivering enough for enough people. If the next forty years are like the last forty years, the American middle class will disappear,\" the firm states on its website. REPUBLICANS TARGET 2 KEY DEMOCRATIC RACES WITH MAMDANI CONNECTION STRATEGY The balance of power in the House of Representatives is in a precarious position ahead of the 2026 midterms. With Republicans holding just a three-seat majority, even one or two key losses for Republicans could cut the legs out from under the GOP's control over the chamber. Pennsylvania — home to both Bresnahan and Mackenzie — also makes up a key battleground state with several competitive districts. According to the Cook Political Report, the state has five competitive Republican-held districts all projected to be a five-point contest or less. In that struggle, the Fight Agency’s leaders have come to the support of Paige Cognetti, a former mayor of Scranton, Pa., who is running to unseat Bresnahan. Bresnahan, a freshman lawmaker, won election to Congress in 2024 by just 1.6 percentage points. \"We can stand tall against a Washington that takes advantage of working people and makes it work for us,\" Cognetti said in her launch video. Rebecca Katz, the Fight Agency’s strategist for the election of Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., reposted Cognetti’s campaign ad in a post to X. \"If you can, pls chip in a few bucks and let’s get someone who cares about people in Congress,\" Rebecca Katz wrote. Cognetti, the former mayor, has also highlighted the firm’s other work, saying she was \"proud to know these folks\" in a repost showcasing the agency’s past campaigns. SOCIALIST WAVE SPREADS COAST TO COAST AS PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS RALLY AROUND ZOHRAN MAMDANI'S NYC WIN Like in Cognetti’s campaign, the Fight Agency team is also supporting Bob Brooks and his race against Republican incumbent Ryan Mackenzie in Pennsylvania. Mackenzie won election by a single percentage point in the last cycle. \"The biggest problem we face is a Washington that burns working people,\" Brooks said in his campaign launch video. \"I’m running for Congress in one of the closest districts to take on the billionaires and big corporations holding us back.\" Morris Katz, the firm’s lead on the Mamdani campaign, reposted Cognetti’s launch video alongside Fight Agency’s main account. Brooks has returned the favor, reposting Fight Agency’s productions in a Maine Senate race. SCOOP: HOUSE REPUBLICANS LINK MAYOR-ELECT MAMDANI TO VULNERABLE CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS With Mamdani, the firm helped produce lighthearted content with a brighter, more comedic edge. In one video, the firm mimicked the style of \"The Bachelor,\" the TV romance show known for its match-making drama. \"New York, will you accept this rose?\" Mamdani asked in the video. In the past, the firm has supported Democrat candidates away from the mainstream of the party, gravitating towards either more progressive candidates or candidates with an unconventional streak. Besides Mamdani, some of Fight Agency’s previous partners include Sen. Bernie Sanders,’ I-Vt., bid for president and Sen. John Fetterman’s 2021 campaign.

        "text": "Trumpworld schism: On Friday night, MAGA Queen Marjorie Taylor Greene announced her resignation from Congress. \"I've always represented the common American man and woman as a member of the House of Representatives, which is why I've always been despised in Washington, D.C. and just never fit in. Americans are used by the political industrial complex of both political parties, election cycle after election cycle, in order to elect whichever side can convince Americans to hate the other side more,\" the Georgia Republican said in her resignation video:\n\nMy message to Georgia's 14th district and America.Thank you. pic.twitter.com/tSoHCeAjn1\n— Marjorie Taylor Greene ???????? (@mtgreenee) November 22, 2025\n\nGreene struck predictably populist America First notes (\"Americans' hard-earned tax dollars always fund foreign wars, foreign aid, and foreign interests\") and mapped her disagreements with the president (\"H1Bs replacing American jobs, AI state moratoriums, debt for life 50 year mortgage scams, standing strongly against all involvement in foreign wars, and demanding the release of the Epstein files\") while touting her loyalty. Read her full statement here.\n\nUntil recently, Greene and President Donald Trump seemed to be thick as thieves. But the Epstein files tore them asunder, with Greene positioning herself as an ardent advocate for full transparency while Trump (until recently) refused to go along. The president, pissed off by Greene's adamance, disavowed her and started publicly musing about how someone should mount a primary challenge, calling his once-loyal acolyte a \"ranting lunatic.\"\n\nThe Epstein issue wedged the door open for Greene to raise more grievances with Trump, especially the idea that he's been getting distracted from his domestic agenda and hasn't delivered much financial relief to the American people. The conflict came to a head during the recent government shutdown. \"I don't see political party lines,\" said Greene, discussing health care and the many Americans who could soon see premiums spiking. Greene criticized her own side for having no workable plan in place to prevent these higher costs.\n\n\"I don't know what happened to Marjorie,\" said Trump recently. \"Nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think.\"\n\nMany of her constituents are still behind her. \"I feel like she has stood her ground,\" Meredith Rosson, a 43-year-old paralegal and the chairwoman of the Republican Party in Chattooga County, told The New York Times. The Republican Party in Floyd County, also in Greene's district, issued a statement of \"unwavering support\" for Greene as soon as she announced her resignation. \"She's realized, 'I need to do what's right for my community and for people who are mostly in the middle ground,'\" cocktail bar/gun store owner Brandon Pledger told the Times.\n\nScenes from New York: \"Violent crime is overwhelmingly the work of a small group of repeat offenders—that is, it is highly concentrated. The remedy, as [James Q.] Wilson argued half a century ago in his classic book Thinking About Crime, is not social engineering but incapacitation: keeping the violent few from striking again,\" argues Tal Fortgang in City Journal. \"In 2022, the New York Times reported that 'nearly a third of all shoplifting arrests in New York City…involved just 327 people,' or 0.004 percent of the population, who had been 'arrested and rearrested more than 6,000 times.'\"\n\n\"We had some interesting conversation, and some of his ideas really are the same ideas I have,\" President Donald Trump said of his Friday meeting with incoming New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani. \"The new word is affordability.\" They appeared to be rather fond of each other, and Trump was in peak form:\n\nQ: Are you affirming that you think President Trump is a fascist?\nMAMDANI: I've spoken about--\nTRUMP: That's okay. You can just say yes.

BlackRock Inc.'s Bitcoin fund IBIT, which accounts for about 60% of the cohort's assets, has registered $2.2 billion in redemptions in November, meaning it will slump to its worst month barring a sharp reversal.\"\nNorth Carolina's Republicans aren't so sure about the federal immigration raids in their districts.\nI'm getting some crazy hate mail for defending the tradwives",

        "text": "The spectacle of last week was the meeting between President Donald Trump and New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, two politicians been going after each other for months. Trump, who had called Mamdani a \"communist lunatic\" during the mayoral election, now declared Mamdani \"a very rational person.\" When journalists asked Mamdani about his past attacks on Trump's \"fascist agenda,\" the president beamed, patted Mamdani, and added, \"That's OK. You can just say it.\"\n\nIn some ways, the encounter resembled Trump's meeting with the new Syrian president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, in May 2025. \"Young, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past. Very strong past. Fighter,\" Trump said of al-Sharaa, former head of Al Qaeda in Syria. It was also a throwback to Trump's first-term outreach to North Korea. After threatening the country with \"fire and fury,\" he had a series of meetings with its leader, Kim Jong Un, whom Trump came to praise as a \"very honorable\" negotiating partner.\n\nOther leaders often take Trump as a sucker for flattery. Since he's apparently willing to bury the hatchet with a few kind words, the thinking goes, those words must be the secret to appeasing him. It rarely works, because Trump is good at smelling weakness. But he respects strength. Trump accepts outreach from former enemies—domestic opponents or foreign warlords—because he enjoys the feeling that he has tamed a dangerous beast.\n\nWith Trump, \"flattery is ultimately counter-productive. In the short term, it avoids a public clash and may even help limit punishment in the form of tariffs or public criticism. In the longer term, far from buying respect, it earns his disdain and encourages the assumption that allies will cave on policy,\" former Biden administration official Philip Gordon wrote in the Financial Times last week.\n\nPerhaps nothing has illustrated this principle better than Trump's relationship with Europe. In a bid to keep American military aid to Ukraine flowing, European leaders have practiced their best flattery skills. In June 2025, North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary General Mark Rutte creepily called Trump \"Daddy.\" In August 2025, a group of European leaders crowded around Trump's desk while he reclined in his chair, like supplicants before a king.\n\nHumiliation begets humiliation. Over and over again, Trump has insulted Europe and made it clear that negotiations for the future of Ukraine will happen over the Europeans' heads. He has demanded a cut from Ukraine's natural resources and pushed the European Union to take a lopsided trade deal that puts tariffs on European products while exempting American ones.\n\nOther allies have tried, and failed with, the same approach. Asian leaders showered Trump with praise and gifts during his last visit to the region. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi promised to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize, and South Korean President Lee Jang Myung gave Trump a literal golden crown. That didn't stop Trump from tariffing Japan into an economic contraction and extracting a $350 billion ransom from South Korea to avoid the same fate.\n\nContrast that with Mexico and Canada, two small countries in America's shadow. Early in his second term, Trump announced blanket tariffs against both of them. He accused Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum of allying with gangsters and even threatened to annex Canada. Rather than trying to appease the U.S. president, Mexico and Canada immediately hit back with tariffs of their own. Ontario, the province of Canada with the most to lose, struck a daredevil tone.\n\n\"If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do anything, including cutting off their energy—with a smile on my face,\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said at a press conference. \"They need to feel the pain.\"\n\nTrump ended up softening and delaying the tariff increases on Mexico and Canada. Just this weekend, he blew through a self-imposed deadline to tariff Canada, which Trump had announced in retaliation for Ford taking out an anti-tariff ad. And he hasn't followed through on his threats to expand the drug war by bombing Mexico. Sheinbaum, a left-wing leader who has declared that Mexicans will \"never bow our heads\" to America, enjoys a strangely warm relationship with Trump.\n\n\"You're tough,\" Trump told Sheinbaum during a private March 2025 phone call, adding in public that he would suspend tariffs \"out of respect\" for his \"very good\" relationship with Sheinbaum.\n\nMamdani, who has threatened to block Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, clearly benefited from the same respect for strength. Despite the huge leverage that the federal government holds over New York City, the mayor-elect came out swinging. He promised in his victory speech to be \"Trump's worst nightmare\" and \"show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him.\"\n\nIt looked a lot more serious than Trump's other domestic opposition. At the beginning of the second Trump administration, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D–N.Y.) had whimpered, \"It's their government. What leverage do we have?\" The same week that Mamdani was reading his followers for confrontation, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D–N.Y.) was surrendering to Republicans on the government shutdown while begging them to see the light of reason. So it shouldn't be much of a surprise that Trump treated Mamdani as an equal and heaped contempt on Schumer.\n\nOf course, personal respect from Trump is not enough to totally derail a hostile agenda. Mexico and Canada still suffered from some tariff increases. And the risk of bluster is having to back it up. Mamdani and Trump still have substantive, zero-sum disagreements that will force them to fight.\n\nBut even if resistance has its downsides, grovelling clearly does not work. European and Asian leaders have thrown away a strong hand by preemptively signalling their intent to surrender. Mexico and Canada's leaders avoided the worst outcome by playing a weak hand with strength. In a palace full of sycophants, the way to win the king's respect is with defiance.",

        "text": "As the sane residents of New York City await (no doubt with bated breath) the mayoralty of stated Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani, a senseless Saturday attack on a subway rider starkly illustrated the already-dangerous reality of out-of-control violent crime in America's once-premier city.\n\nAccording to the NYPD, the 54-year-old straphanger was punched in the face, several times, then stabbed in the stomach after asking another passenger to talk more quietly on his cellphone.\n\nThe attacker jumped off the train at the station and was on the loose, police told the NY Post, while the victim was taken to Jamaica Hospital in stable condition. The attack occurred aboard an E train at the Jamaica Center–Parsons/Archer station in Queens around 11 a.m., police said.\n\nHere's more:\n\nThe attack comes a day after a homeless man was arrested for allegedly slashing two men in their faces in a caught-on-video outburst on a busy subway platform in Queens last week.Tyquan Manassa, 28, was charged Friday in connection to the Wednesday afternoon attacks on the two men on the southbound platform of the E and F train at the Union Turnpike station in Kew Gardens, the NYPD said.Manassa was identified as the stabbing suspect after cops busted him for a separate, unhinged outburst at the Ward’s Island shelter where he’d been staying Thursday, sources said.\n\nIn other words, business as usual in the Big Apple.\n\nALSO CHECK OUT: The Downfall of America's Cities: Crime Reporting vs. Crime Victimization\n\nDeSantis Makes Impassioned Pitch Directly to NYC Police Officers Ahead of Probable Mamdani Mayoral Win\n\nIn a follow-up interview with the Post, the victim’s daughter said the NYC subway system needs a stronger police presence:\n\nThey’re supposed to be on the station. I don’t really see them as much anymore. It’s a crazy world we live in.\n\nThe victim's daughter added: “He’s talking, he’s eating, he’s good.\"\n\nAccording to the outlet, the victim, a waiter, was \"heading home from his restaurant gig\" when the senseless attack occurred.\n\nSubway rider, 18-year-old Fatima Shahid, also spoke with the Post about subway violence in the city:\n\nUnfortunately, I feel like it happens so often that it’s kind of like we’re desensitized to it. It does make me feel a little unsafe. I’m glad that I don’t take the train as often as I used to. ... So I feel a little OK, but I know that somebody who does it every day would be scared and feel unsafe.\n\nA 37-year-old man who identified himself as Perry said he was surprised by the stabbing:\n\nNo, this is not normal, and not what I’ve heard or seen before. Just hearing this is crazy.\n\nNormal, or not, what are the chances of subway violence — make that overall violence — decreasing in NYC after Mamdani takes office on January 1? After all, we're talking about a left-wing extremist who wants to deploy social workers instead of police officers to respond to 911 calls. \n\nJust one problem: the controversial plan has already been operating in the Big Apple on a small scale, and is failing miserably:\n\nThe early results of a program dubbed B-HEARD spell trouble for Mamdani’s proposed $1.1 billion Department of Community Safety (DCS), a signature initiative that his newly announced chief of staff and left-hand woman, Elle Bisgaard-Church, helped craft.B-HEARD launched in 2021 as a pilot program and only operates in some city neighborhoods, but a bleak audit conducted in May by the city comptroller found it was limping — with a whopping 60% of calls deemed ineligible while more than 35% of eligible calls from mental health professionals never got a response.“Calls were considered potentially dangerous, were ineligible because a mental health professional was already at the scene, or were unable to be triaged because FDNY EMS did not take the call or all necessary information could not be collected about the person in distress,” the comptroller’s office wrote in a news release at the time.\n\nSo, yeah, raise your hand if you think crime will worsen in New York City after Mamdani ushers in his socialist (read: Marxist) mentality to respond to potentially dangerous and violent crimes. \n\nJust as I thought.\n\nNote: Do you enjoy RedState’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

        "text": "All eyes were on the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and newly elected New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani at the White House on Friday, November 21. However, JD Vance was MIA. The duo looked relatively cordial with each other and also completed the press conference without taking any potshots at each other.\n\nThis was despite the President and Mamdani coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum. Now, Fox News host Brian Kilmeade has speculated that this friendly rendezvous between the two might not go down so well with U.S. Vice President JD Vance.\n\nAdditionally, the host also called the vice president “jealous” of how well Trump and Zohran got along. He said on-air shortly after the meeting between Donald Trump and Zohran Mamdani, saying, “There you go, that’s what we just watched. I think JD Vance is jealous. I think the president wants to use him as a running mate. They really got along fantastic.”\n\nHowever, Vance appeared unaffected, sharing an X post featuring a press conference highlight where a reporter questioned Mamdani about his past comment calling the President a “fascist.”\n\nPOTUS has a lot of good moments, but this is an all-timer https://t.co/Ge0vYEiJhP\n— JD Vance (@JDVance) November 21, 2025\n\nA visibly flustered Zohran could be seen trying to deflect the question, but Trump jokingly told him just to go ahead and say it again in front of the media, too. The moment prompted laughter from reporters.\n\nSharing the same, JD Vance captioned the video, stating, “POTUS has a lot of good moments, but this is an all-timer.” For content, contrary to public opinion, both the president and the New York City mayor described their banter as rather positive.\n\nTrump and Mamdani revealed that they discussed various key issues facing New York, including affordability, immigration, the Middle East, crime rates, and housing costs. Surprisingly, the two declined to answer all questions about their past negative opinions of each other.\n\nNot only that, Donald Trump revealed that he would feel comfortable living in New York City with Zohran Mamdani as mayor. Many users quickly reacted to JD Vance’s post, highlighting the light moment between the duo in the White House press conference.\n\nOne user wrote, “Aww, they are bonding.” Another wrote, “It’s pretty funny seeing Trump say ‘just say yes.’ Definitely made me laugh out loud.” However, a netizen took a jab at Vance and commented, “Bro was not invited.”\n\n​However, in his later interview, Mamdani stood by his view that he indeed thinks that the president is a fascist. During an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, the newly elected NYC mayor was asked whether he stands by his previous statement on Trump, despite their cordial meeting.\n\nTo this, Mamdani responded, “Everything that I’ve said in the past I continue to believe. I think it is important in our politics that we don’t shy away from where we have disagreements.”",

        "text": "The defining moment of Zohran Mamdani’s Friday meeting with Donald Trump was plain to see. It was when the tough-talking commie was asked by a reporter if he still stood by his tiresome campaign claims that the American president is a fascist.\n\nFor one, Mamdani and his fellow leftists don’t even know what a fascist is. But we do, and wethinks we see an awful lot of projection here.\n\nFor two, Mamdani won the New York City mayor’s race by preaching about affordability (read: “affordability”) and by fulminating about the fascist-in-chief in the White House. And during his victory speech, he sneeringly said to the American president, “So Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up!”\n\nSurely, then, when asked about it directly, Florida’s Realtor of the Year would stand up to the vile Trump and double down on his fascist charge, right? Surely, he’d fulfill the hopes and dreams of his Trump-deranged legions by speaking truth to power right there in the Oval Office, right?\n\nWrong. And don’t call him Shirley, even if he can’t knock out a single sorry rep at 135.\n\n“Are you affirming that you think President Trump is a fascist?” came the question from Fox News White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich — a question calling for a simple yes-or-no answer, a question to which Mamdani manfully replied, “I’ve spoken about the…”\n\nTrump immediately stepped in to rescue Mamdani: “That’s okay, you can just say, ‘Yes,’” said Trump with a smile and a dismissive wave of the hand and a couple of pats on Mamdani’s arm. “Go ahead. It’s easier — it’s easier than explaining it. I don’t mind.”\n\nThis was pure Trump, who, despite his well-earned reputation as a political street-fighter, is at his essence a fine host and a gentleman. He recognized immediately that the question put his guest in a tough spot, and he defused it by making light of it. The moment had the makings of a great ambush: Fox News reporter, tough question, star-struck visitor to the Oval Office. And a lesser man — yours truly, for example — would’ve made Mamdani squirm, especially after all the vile things he’d been saying. But not Trump. He was magnanimous.\n\nThis isn’t meant to make light of this dirty little demagogue’s name-calling because it’s deadly serious stuff. Were it not, Charlie Kirk’s leftist assassin wouldn’t have etched “Hey fascist! Catch!” into one of his bullet casings.\n\nThe Democrat Party’s behavior, generally, has become diseased by coarseness, crudity, and incivility as it tries to one-up Donald Trump’s straight talk and toughness. It won’t work, though, because whereas Trump is an utterly authentic throat-puncher, the Democrats to a person are not. So when an opportunistic insurrectionist like Senator Elissa Slotkin tells her colleagues to “get a little more alpha energy,” and when milquetoasts like Chuck Schumer and Chris Murphy are dropping F-bombs in X posts, and when elite prep-schoolers like Jasmine Crockett are talkin’ like they’s from the ‘hood, you know that in addition to being unmoored, even unhinged, these people are also trying to be something they’re not: tough. Think about it: The toughest guys in the Democrat Party are the women.\n\nAfterward, Trump was even more generous: “I feel very confident that he can do a good job,” said Trump about his guest. “I think he is going to surprise some conservative people, actually. … We agree on a lot more than I would have thought.”\n\nSo this brief snapshot in time spoke volumes about Trump, but it also spoke volumes about that simpering little two-faced commie Mamdani.\n\nOver the weekend, on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Mamdani told moderator Kristen Welker that he still thinks Trump is a fascist. “After President Trump said that, I said, 'Yes,’” Mamdani insisted, adding, “That’s something I’ve said in the past, and I say today. And I think what I appreciated about the conversation that I had with the president was that we were not shy about the places of disagreement, about the politics that has brought us to this moment, and we also wanted to focus on what it could look like to deliver on a shared analysis of an affordability crisis for New Yorkers.”\n\nTrump throws the guy a lifeline and signals a willingness to help beleaguered New York City, and this little weakling stabs him in the back.\n\nThat’s all you need to know about commies. And Trump-deranged Democrats.",

        "text": "FIRST ON FOX: A Senate Republican wants to take a legislative shot at New York Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and his desire to arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Sen. Ted Budd, R-N.C., is introducing legislation that would halt some funding to cities that follow through on any International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant to arrest or detain officials from North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries. The measure, called the \"American Allies Protection Act,\" is in direct response to Mamdani doubling down on his vow to arrest Netanyahu. Last year, the ICC issued a warrant for the Israeli prime minister’s arrest that has been heavily scrutinized by lawmakers in the U.S. and abroad. ADL CHIEF WARNS NYC MAYOR-ELECT ZOHRAN MAMDANI POSES A 'CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER' TO JEWISH COMMUNITY Mamdani reiterated his desire to arrest Netanyahu last week before meeting with President Donald Trump. He told local news station ABC7 that New York City was a \"city of international law\" that would uphold the court’s arrest warrants, which accused the Israeli prime minister of intentionally attacking civilians and using starvation as a method of warfare. \"I’ve said time and again that I believe this is a city of international law, and being a city of international law means looking to uphold international law,\" he said. \"And that means upholding the warrants from the International Criminal Court, whether they’re for Benjamin Netanyahu or Vladimir Putin.\" TRUMP REVEALS 'ONE THING IN COMMON' HE HAS WITH MAMDANI AFTER OVAL OFFICE LOVE FEST Budd charged in a statement to Fox News Digital that the U.S. is \"not bound by the morally bankrupt\" court, and accused Mamdani’s position and comments of not being based in law but rather a means to \"virtue-signal to his radical, anti-Israel base.\" \"Mayor-elect Mamdani’s pledge to facilitate the arrest of Benjamin Netanyahu is not just ridiculous; it represents a grave threat that could seriously damage America’s relationship with our closest allies and partners,\" Budd said. LEAVITT DOESN'T MINCE WORDS AHEAD OF MAMDANI-TRUMP MEETING: 'COMMUNIST COMING TO THE WHITE HOUSE' His legislation would halt Department of Justice (DOJ) grants from flowing to any city that cooperates with the court and arrests a NATO or U.S. major non-NATO ally. There is an override mechanism built in that would allow the president to end the penalty only if cooperation with the court is deemed necessary for national security.

When asked if there was discussion of stopping Mamdani from arresting Netanyahu, Trump said the pair, \"Didn’t discuss\" the matter.",

        "text": "The proposal would require a minimum premium payment and limit eligibility for the subsidies, which come in the form of tax credits, to enrollees with income up to 700% of the federal poverty line, the report said. \n\nThe administration is also seeking an option that would let enrollees to get part of their tax credit through a savings account, according to Politico. That’s after Trump had suggested earlier that consumers receive subsidies directly.\n\nThe White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, shares of insurer Centene, which is a top participant in public health exchanges, jumped 8% on Monday, Molina Healthcare rallied 5%, and Oscar Health soared 24%.\n\nWithout an extension of the subsidies, consumers who buy policies on the ACA marketplace would see insurance premiums more than double on average. Millions of Americans have already gotten sticker shock as open enrollment for 2026 began earlier this month.\n\nThe subsidies were at the center of the longest government shutdown in history as Democrats pushed to renew the COVID-era aid, while Republicans and the White House insisted on letting them expire at year’s end. The shutdown ended without a renewal, with Democrats only getting a promise for a vote in the Senate.\n\nBut the GOP’s stunning losses in this month’s off-year elections highlighted affordability as a top voter concern. Since then, Trump has rolled back tariffs hitting groceries, floated a $2,000 tariff “dividend” payment, and backed an idea for a 50-year mortgage meant to lower monthly payments.\n\nTrump’s Oval Office meeting on Friday with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, was also surprisingly friendly as the president emphasized their common ground on improving affordability rather than wide ideological differences. \n\nA two-year extension for the subsidies would notably stretch beyond next year’s midterm elections, potentially giving Republicans some political cover amid fears of a Democratic wave.\n\nLetting them expire, however, would risk significant voter backlash in GOP strongholds, as more than half of the 24 million enrollees receiving the subsidies live in a handful of Southern states.\n\nA KFF analysis last month of ACA marketplace data found 57% of enrollees live in congressional districts represented by a Republican.\n\nIn fact, all congressional districts in Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina have at least 10% of their populations enrolled in ACA plans, according to KFF. That goes for nearly all districts in Texas and Utah.\n\n“While a relatively small share of the national population gets their coverage through the ACA Marketplaces, in some districts, the number of ACA enrollees could be enough to swing a close election,” KFF said last month.",

        "text": "Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert comic strip, recently shared an extraordinary personal story that reveals a side of Donald Trump most people never see and the left certainly doesn’t want to acknowledge. Adams recounted sitting at home in his La-Z-Boy chair, watching a video of Trump just after he met with Zohran Mamdani in the Oval Office. As he listened to Trump on his phone, the call came: the president himself was calling Adams from West Palm Beach.\n\n\"Yes, the president called me while I was watching the president on TV,\" Adams said, as if stunned by the surreal nature of it all. Trump called to check on how Adams was doing with his medical situation. \n\nAdams emphasized how unbelievable this was, saying, \"You cannot get used to that. There’s no way your brain can actually process it, that you’re sitting at home, you’re literally watching the most powerful, in my opinion, and successful president in the history of all humankind... And then the real one calls me while I’m sitting there.\" He was dumbfounded, stating plainly, \"It’s just mind-blowing.\"\n\nNot only did Trump call him once, but he called twice. Adams admitted he missed the first call but made sure to return it.\n\nAnd the affection and concern from Trump didn’t stop there. Dr. Mehmet Oz also called Adams to check on him, ensuring Adams was receiving quality healthcare.\n\nAdams acknowledged that some might accuse him of leveraging his connections for special treatment, but he dismissed those suspicions: \"I’m not aware of any special things outside of the boundaries of my healthcare that I’m getting. But I’m definitely getting the, getting a good version of it.\"\n\n🚨NEW: @ScottAdamsSays reveals Trump & Dr. Oz both called to check in on him yesterday🤯\"Trump called just to make sure I was doing okay and I was getting the help I needed for my medical situation. He followed up. My God.\"\"I will never get used to that! There's no way your… pic.twitter.com/UyWVvW7kPb— Jason Cohen 🇺🇸 (@JasonJournoDC) November 22, 2025\n\nThe reason I’m sharing this story, of course, is because it paints Trump not as the caricature the left enjoys portraying but as a deeply engaged and caring individual, especially toward those loyal to him. From Adams' account, Trump is someone who personally follows up. This story reveals a side of Trump both extraordinary and personal, a side that clashes with the popular narrative but one that Adams insists is real.\n\nAdams revealed earlier this year that he was battling metastatic prostate cancer and had a prognosis of just months to live.\n\n\"I have the same cancer that Joe Biden has. I also have prostate cancer that has also spread to my bones, but I've had it longer than he's had it — well, longer than he's admitted having it,\" Adams said. \"I expect to be checking out from this domain sometime this summer.\"\n\nThankfully, his fight has continued longer than his prediction.\n\nUltimately, Adams' story isn’t just about a phone call. It’s about witnessing America's most powerful man as a real person who reaches out in moments of human need—something most Americans don’t get to see, and the political left certainly doesn’t want to admit.\n\nWant to support fearless journalism that exposes the Left and tells the stories the media won’t?

It’s easier than explaining. I don’t mind.”More: Mamdani noted in the interview that aired on Sunday that – after Trump made the jab – he said \"yes,\" to the reporter's question.\"That’s something I’ve said in the past (and) I say it today,\" Mamdani said.More: More: While different definitions abound, many experts agree that fascism is an extreme combination of nationalism and militarism, often accompanied by a cult of personality surrounding a leader.The \"Meet the Press\" appearance was Mamdani's first national interview since the White House meeting, which captured public attention for the pair's chummy, positive attitudes after months of trading blows. Trump has blasted the incoming mayor in several social media posts, calling him a communist and \"nut job\" in the lead-up to his overwhelming Election Day victory.Though Mamdani said he hasn't changed his mind on the president's positions, he still said he's hopeful they can work together to address affordability. The costs of housing, childcare and groceries were central to Mamdani's successful campaign.\"What I appreciated about the conversation that I had with the president was that we were not shy about the places of disagreement, about the politics that has brought us to this moment,\" Mamdani said of Trump. \"And we also wanted to focus on what it could look like to deliver on a shared analysis of an affordability crisis for New Yorkers,” he said.Kathryn Palmer is a politics reporter for USA TODAY.

        "text": "Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said that the key to his recent successful closed door meeting with President Donald Trump was a shared interest in the cost of living and making the city better.\n\n“Too often, when two politicians meet, the conversation rarely extends beyond them,” Mamdani said Sunday at a news conference outside of Union Grove Missionary Baptist Church in the Bronx. “And what we found instead is that this was a conversation that was productive, a conversation that was focused on New York City and a conversation that looks to deliver for the people of New York City.”\n\nMamdani said he was “feeling good” in his first appearance back in New York City since his trip to the nation’s capital. \n\nPoliticians across the country, analysts and local New Yorkers reacted with surprise to the nature of the two leaders' meeting that appeared cordial and friendly. Some opined on social media that Mamdani had ‘won’ the meeting, while others said Trump did.\n\n“I think it was New Yorkers that won in this conversation. It was a conversation that came back again and again to the people of the city,” Mamdani said.\n\nMamdani’s return to the city comes just over a month before he is set to be sworn in to City Hall, leaving future questions looming about Trump’s involvement in local affairs once he takes office. The Trump administration has previously threatened to withhold critical federal funding for the Hudson River tunnels project and the Second Avenue Subway extension, and deploy National Guard troops to address perceived crime. \n\nMamdani said earlier in the morning on an appearance on “Meet The Press” that he told Trump there is no need to deploy the National Guard to New York, like he has in other cities. \n\n“What I told him is that what separates New York City from anywhere else in the country is that we have the NYPD. And I trust the NYPD to deliver public safety,” Mamdani said. “And, to me, that is something that I know they can do, have done and will continue to do under my leadership.\"\n\nPresident Trump said on Saturday that he would send the National Guard to the city if he felt it was needed, but other places need it more right now. \n\nBut the mayor-elect said he’s confident that the federal government will help in the effort to improve life in the city — but still acknowledged key differences on the issues of immigration.\n\n“I’ll let the president speak for himself,” Mamdani said when asked about Trump believing ICE hasn’t done enough in the city yet. “ There may be disagreements between the president and myself, and they will continue to be, and I will always make the case for each and every person that calls the City Hall.”",

        "text": "In one respect, New York City’s unusual election results this year fit a national pattern: Voters opted to make housing easier and faster to build. Here’s hoping it’s a trend that lasts.\n\nA lack of housing has become a nationwide problem. High prices and mortgage rates have depressed sales. With rent costs outpacing incomes, nearly half the nation’s growing population of renters pays more than 30% of their income on housing. In New York, the rental vacancy rate has plummeted to 1.4% and the homeless population has soared.\n\nAt long last, voters seem to be waking up to a problem that research identified decades ago: Policies that protect existing homeowners and other local interests have restricted development and driven up costs. New Yorkers voted to speed up reviews of affordable housing and other modest projects and weaken local council members’ veto power. A zoning reform last year, the city’s biggest since 1961, followed similar proposals in fast-growing cities such as Austin and Minneapolis. California’s governor is overriding mayoral opposition to apartment construction in Los Angeles.\n\nSuch measures could provide local leaders with a historic opportunity. New York, by some estimates, needs to build as many as 50,000 units a year, well above its recent pace, to make up for decades of underdevelopment. There are already signs of progress: In the third quarter, developers filed proposals for 11,746 new residential units citywide, 162% higher than the average since 2008. Conversions of vacant office space could produce 17,000 more.\n\nYet zoning limits and sluggish land-use reviews aren’t the only obstacles. Successfully addressing the housing shortage will require cities to work with state governments and the private sector to prioritize home construction - and occasionally to override competing interests.\n\nHere New York offers several examples of what not to do. One needless constraint is an affordable-housing tax-incentive program passed by the state last year, which imposes higher construction wages and below-market-rent requirements on buildings with 100 units or more. Unsurprisingly, the city has since seen a surge in towers with precisely 99 apartments. The goal should be to reward more units, not to punish them.\n\nSimilarly, affordable rents require keeping landlords’ costs low. Yet New York’s convoluted property-tax system levies higher rates on large apartment buildings than on single-family homes, thus discouraging density and penalizing renters when the costs are passed on. The state’s unique scaffold law imposes absolute liability on owners and contractors for “gravity-related” worker injuries, thereby inflating insurance, construction and maintenance costs. (A recent study found insurance costs for rent-stabilized apartments climbed 150% from 2019 to 2025.) Nearly every US state is plagued by similarly costly impediments; eliminating them should be a national priority.\n\nFinally, with fewer than half of New York City’s rental units available on the free market, fierce competition keeps rents at near records. Freezing rents for the rest, as Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has promised, will only reduce landlords’ capacity to invest in upkeep and drive more properties into financial distress. (A survey of landlords last year found that more than 25,000 rent-stabilized apartments were vacant because their owners couldn’t afford to renovate.) Instead, providing more owners with a gradual path to deregulated rents would give them an incentive to upgrade - and to develop more properties.\n\nIf New York were to finally raze some of its homegrown obstacles, perhaps states such as California might revisit the myriad policies - such as decades-old property-tax limits - that benefit homeowners at the expense of new buyers and builders. Another housing boom, for New York and for the nation, is long overdue.\n\nThe Editorial Board publishes the views of the editors across a range of national and global affairs.",

        "text": "For most normal people, the likelihood of adding a real-deal Cartier Crash to their collection is next to nothing. Sure, it could happen, but between the Crash’s scarcity and the six-figure price tags they generally fetch at auctions, those odds are pretty slim. Still, the Salvador Dali-looking watch has developed a massive following in the scene. Whether collectors opt for a watch actually designed by the Spanish artist or turn to burgeoning independents clearly inspired by the watch’s unusual curves, the appetite for the Crash is hardly slowing down. This month, an independent brand is launching one of the coolest and most inventive takes on the Crash yet—all in a super-affordable package.\nStreetwear brand Open Bar Funeral is the brainchild of Mark Nguyen and specializes in boxy sizing, flowy fits (I wear their pleated carpenter pants several days a week). Like many brands that specialize in streetwear, though, the temptation to make a wristwatch proved too strong—especially with an idea this good.\nOBF’s inaugural watch is the “Crashio,” which combines the aesthetic of the Cartier Crash with the digital watches made famous by Casio. The timepiece features a 27x46.5mm resin case with a matching stainless steel Jubilee-style bracelet. The digital face sports a 12/24 date format and an auto-calendar, a backlit display, plus daily and hourly alarm capabilities. And, in a particularly inspired touch, the digital display is also warped to match the shape of the case. Accurate to +30 seconds a month and with a seven-year CR2016 battery life, it’s a stylish steal at a retail rate of just $128.\nMaking an impression in a crowded watch space—especially just after a bunch of noisy (and largely expensive) reveals at Dubai Watch Week—is no small feat, especially if a brand is making an effort to break into the market for the first time. Open Bar Funeral’s approach, in turn, is refreshing. Rather than overcomplicating things or starting too small, they’re working with reliable influences—Cartier, the Crash craze, and simple digital pieces beloved by everyone from your dad to Zohran Mamdani—to create something any watch fan can tell you is going to sell out quick. Speaking of which, mark your calendars: the Open Bar Funeral ‘Crashio’ watch goes on sale 11/28.",

        "text": "In January, both ends of City Hall will be under new leadership.\n\nThe voters chose Zohran Mamdani as the city’s next chief executive. He will run the mayor’s side of the oldest functioning City Hall in the country.\n\nThe members of the City Council, however, will elect a new speaker, who will lead the city’s legislature from the building’s opposite wing.\n\nAhead of that January vote, the neck-and-neck front-runners are Julie Menin, an Upper East Side establishment Democrat considered a relative moderate, and the progressive Crystal Hudson of Brooklyn, the mayor-elect’s ideological fellow traveler. \n\nWhile not nearly as prominent as the mayor, the speaker holds significant power over the direction of the city government.\n\nShe or he decides which of the hundreds of bills pending in the council come before the body for a vote.\n\nThe speaker also appoints the chairs of the committees in which those bills originate, who have the power to oversee and investigate city agencies.\n\nIf Hudson is elected, she will bring up bills that advance the agenda of her progressive base.\n\nFor example, City Council leftists, including its Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) members, are determined to pass the Community Opportunity to Purchase Act (COPA).\n\nThis proposed local law would force any owner selling a building with three or more units to notify the city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development and share information about the building’s finances before listing it for sale.\n\nOwners would then have to give qualified nonprofits an exclusive 120-day window to make offers on the building — during which they’d be prohibited from selling to an individual or a “for-profit” entity.\n\nWorse, the HPD commissioner can extend this period, placing even more pressure on financially strapped owners to sell to a nonprofit.\n\nThe measure may well be unconstitutional, but DSA-style progressives will deploy it to push favored not-for-profit companies — many of which depend on the council for funding — to become primary owners of city residential real estate.\n\nTheir misguided worldview assumes these quasi-governmental landlords are superior to the small, family-based businesses that own a large share of the outer boroughs’ rent-regulated multi-family buildings.\n\nUnder Speaker Hudson, a radical, anti-private property, anti-business measure like COPA is likely to reach the council floor.\n\nShe could also use her power to foist bad policy upon the mayor.\n\nWhen Mayor Eric Adams refused to run the NYPD according to the progressives’ preferences, the council passed the How Many Stops law to require officers to fill out reams of paperwork describing their interactions with the public.\n\nIf, for example, Mamdani takes the advice of Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch and abandons his promises to disband the NYPD’s Strategic Response Unit and suppress its gang database, Speaker Hudson could push legislation that bans the unit and dismantles the database.\n\nIn doing so, she’d override the police commissioner and corner Mamdani between his ideological campaign promises and the real-life demands of public safety. \n\nOnly the speaker has the prerogative to prevent the worst bills from reaching a vote.\n\nIf she chooses not to, she can place the new mayor in a very difficult position — forcing him to choose between prudential governance, supported by a broad consensus, and the ideological dreams of his far-left allies.\n\nConversely, a Speaker Menin could bottle up the DSA’s legislative disasters, shielding the mayor from his own bad ideas and giving him the room he needs to govern in a more moderate and effective way.\n\nMamdani may already perceive the need for such a built-in check.\n\nNot only has he retained Tisch, he has also refused to support City Councilman Chi Ossé’s primary bid against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY).\n\nAnd in contrast to his aggressive victory speech, Mamdani’s visit with President Trump on Friday was remarkably measured, even genial.\n\nThe mayor-elect seems to understand that he can’t succeed amid ceaseless anxiety over public safety and in a perpetual war with non-DSA Democrats.\n\nIf he wants to be an effective mayor, Mamdani must transform himself from outside agitator railing against the system to a wise manager of that very system.\n\nWhile Hudson appears to be his natural ally and ideological companion, Mamdani’s mayoralty could sink under the weight of an overactive, radical City Council that places him under constant leftist political pressure.\n\nA partnership with the older, more experienced Menin — who, incidentally, is Jewish — would offer balance at the grand staircase that stands as the fulcrum between the two wings of City Hall.\n\nWith a race that can tip either way, the speakership will decide whether New York’s next mayor starts off on a steady footing — or begins to slip with his first step.\n\nChristian Browne is an attorney and adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, where John Ketcham is director of cities and a legal policy fellow.",

Ian Wright here,” the 62-year-old ex-striker’s message began. “I just want to say a massive, massive congratulations on what you’ve achieved. The real work starts now, but God willing, you can achieve everything that you have set out to achieve.”\n\nA visibly stunned Mamdani, 34, sputtered “What?” as the video began, then directed an “I love you” at Wright’s image on the screen.\n\nWright concluded his message by telling Mamdani that his favorite soccer team was “gonna need some of that winning energy that you’ve got, my friend, and get behind the boys. It’s a long way to go, just have to stay calm, back [manager] Mikel [Arteta], and all the boys.\n\n“Up the Gunners, baby. Take it easy and God bless, my friend.”\n\n“I’m gonna watch it again,” Mamdani told Friedland after the message from Wright ended. “I love this man.”\n\nThe surprise wrapped up a happy weekend for Mamdani, whose beloved Gunners defeated local rivals Tottenham Hotspur, 4-1, earlier Sunday to move six points clear in England’s top division.\n\nThat result followed an unexpectedly warm meeting at the White House between Mamdani and President Trump, during which the commander-in-chief said he would be “cheering” for the Democratic socialist to “really do something great for New York.”",

        "text": "Resurfaced warnings from the late Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk about the dangers of young Americans embracing socialism are drawing new attention after New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist, met with President Donald Trump at the White House. \"How do we get more young people under the age of 35 to have equity in the system? Not the Democrat version of equity, where they want to have redistribution, but actually, are they paying a mortgage? Do they own stuff? Or are they permanent renters?\" Kirk asked during a July 11 appearance on \"Fox & Friends.\" TRUMP PREDICTS 'CIVIL' MEETING WITH MAMDANI DESPITE PAST COMMENTS ABOUT EACH OTHER \"A permanent renting class in this country is the prerequisite, is the leading ingredient for radical politics that nobody wants to see,\" he continued. \"We need to reinvigorate the ownership economy. And then all of a sudden, when you own stuff, you're less likely to burn down Wendy's and vote for candidates like Zohran Mamdani.\" GOP WARNED TO TAKE ACTION OR 'LOSE' GEN Z VOTERS AFTER MAMDANI WINS NYC MAYOR RACE Later that day, speaking at the Turning Point USA Summit in Tampa, Florida, Kirk doubled down on his warning, taking aim at Mamdani’s push for city-run grocery stores and his previously espoused defund the police rhetoric. \"All that is garbage,\" Kirk said. \"But we failed to understand why he is rising… a part of it is that people in New York are not like you wonderful people here in Florida… But there's a deeper thing at play… Younger voters are trying to get their leaders' attention. We can't afford anything.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Kirk’s comments resurfaced on Monday’s \"Fox & Friends\" broadcast on the heels of Mamdani and President Donald Trump holding a cordial meeting at the White House to discuss the affordability crisis, public safety and the challenges facing New Yorkers. Mamdani, on Sunday, called it important that people in politics don't shy away from areas with disagreements, all while understanding that such issues \"[bring] us to the table.\" Co-host Brian Kilmeade emphasized recent Fox News polling showing three quarters of voters view the economy negatively and continue to be concerned about affordability. Grocery costs are a particular pain point for voters, as the poll asked if costs for items have increased, decreased or remained the same compared to a year ago. An 85% majority said they've increased, whereas 10% reported a decrease and 5% said there's been no change.",

        "text": "Donald Trump‘s fashion has become the latest topic of gossip among onlookers. The 79-year-old, who has otherwise mostly hogged the limelight over his political manoeuvring, has now surprised everyone. Well, netizens are even questioning if his latest meeting with New York’s recently elected mayor, Zohran Mamdani, at the White House might have influenced his sense of style.\n\nThe duo’s recent meeting grabbed attention because there was no awkwardness between them. The U.S. President even felt comfortable with the incoming mayor tagging him as a fascist publicly in front of numerous cameras.\n\nThe next day after the meeting, Trump was spotted wearing an oversized black overcoat, given the recent drop in temperatures. He added a deep red scarf around his neck, which further enhanced the impression of a totally new, never-before-seen outfit for the American President. So much so that people have been taken aback by his latest look, stopping to stare as he made his way toward Marine One. Trump even addressed the press wearing the same kind of outfit, which is totally unlike his usual wardrobe choices. Naturally, this new fad has left the internet abuzz with questions.\n\nDonald Trump has had a surprisingly cordial meeting with New York City-mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, despite their very different political ideologies.\n\n— KORNERSTONE (@Kornerstone4) November 24, 2025\n\nAs Donald Trump’s pictures and videos of his latest winter-approved look surfaced, netizens began expressing their opinions without a thought. One of the most apparent observations has definitely been how the President’s outfit deeply resembled Zohran Mamdani‘s signature look. One of the netizens wrote, “Looks like the old man took some fashion tips from Mamdani, too,” while another user commented, “Well, I declare, Donald Trump in a red turtleneck looking like he’s fixing to join the country club! Bless his heart. Y’all think this is the start of a new fashion era?”\n\nSome netizens even compared Trump’s new-age-inspired look in an overcoat and scarf, mocking him for trying to step into millennial-chic winter style and channeling a younger, hipster look. A third user wrote, “Trump strutting in that black full-length coat with the maroon scarf… looks less like a statesman and more like a villain in a winter dystopia.”\n\nWhether a new fashion era, a case of copied inspiration, or just a change of thought, Donald Trump’s latest appearance has everyone buzzing with a lot of assumptions. But the President seems unbothered, just as he was when he interacted with Mamdani in the Oval Office. Even though it was their first face-to-face meeting, there is no evidence to prove that things between the two are not on good terms.\n\nWait until his actions match his words. America has more differences with Mamdani than in common.\n\nTrump on Mamdani Meet: ‘We Agree on More Than I Thought’ https://t.co/4lxA8py1Wr\n— Martster (@Martster2510) November 24, 2025\n\nInterestingly, Mamdani, a 34-year-old, was asked to clarify whether he wished to retract any of his previous statements against Donald Trump. These included terms like “despot” and “fascist,” considering the two of them did have a civil moment recently.\n\nIn response, Mamdani stated, “We are both very clear on our positions and our views, and what I really appreciate about the president is our meeting focused not on places of disagreement but the shared purpose we have.” On the other hand, the U.S. President did not even raise a quizzical brow on the matter. Trump said, “I’ve been called much worse than a despot.” Later on, the POTUS further signaled his inclination toward living in NYC himself while de Blasio was the mayor. He then added, “Yeah, I would, especially after the meeting. Absolutely.”",

        "text": "The government shutdown may be over, but for millions of families across the country, the damage is done. Food assistance was delayed for over 40 million people, health care access has become uncertain for the tens of millions who rely on Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, lines at food pantries have doubled and veterans and active-duty members are waiting for benefits they rely on. Once again, political stunts in Washington have treated people as bargaining chips—a stark reminder that we cannot rely on federal leaders to protect everyday families.\n\nThrough all this, Californians have sent a clear and resounding message: We reject this type of governance. Voters want leaders who protect working families, strengthen public systems and take bold action when Washington fails. November’s elections were more than just a vote—they were a mandate, showing that voters are ready to back measures and candidates who reflect these values.\n\nVolunteers distribute free groceries at a drive-through food distribution event amid the federal government shutdown which caused SNAP/CalFresh food benefits delays on November 20, 2025, in Altadena, California. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)\n\nWhen the federal government flounders, California can step up and demonstrate how government should work: organizing Operation Feed California to support the recipients affected by delayed SNAP benefits, sending an emergency infusion of money to Planned Parenthood after losing federal funding and supporting the thousands of veterans whose jobs were jeopardized when President Donald Trump threatened federal workforce cuts. These actions are not abstract—they have the potential to directly benefit millions of Californians and set a national example for what bold, people-centered governance can look like. And Californians are already putting their values into action. \n\nIn Santa Clara County, voters overwhelmingly approved Measure A, a sales tax increase that county leaders placed on the ballot after it was estimated that President Trump’s cuts to Medicaid and SNAP would reduce county revenues by $1 billion a year by the end of the decade. The measure is set to raise roughly $330 million annually for safety-net programs. Its passage signals that Californians are willing to take concrete steps to protect the services their families rely on, even when federal support is uncertain.\n\nIn Santa Cruz, voters faced a similar choice, with Measure C—a measure designed to fund affordable housing and help prevent homelessness. The measure would double the tax and extend it for 20 years, and was passed by over 54 percent of the vote. \n\nAnd let’s not forget about the major statewide win, Proposition 50. Californians overwhelmingly voted to pass Prop 50, marking a bold step in structural democratic reform, not just for California but as a model for our national future.\n\nThroughout the state, voters rejected far-right extremism—they also rejected complacency.\n\nBut California isn’t alone. Across the country, voters delivered wins for candidates and measures that pushed back against Trump’s countless cuts. From progressive champions like Zohran Mamdani in New York to Democratic governors winning their elections in states like New Jersey and Virginia, the appetite for bold, people-centered governance expands far beyond our state. \n\nThe contrast could not be more evident. On election night, people shifted from feeling hopeless to feeling hopeful, demonstrating that they will choose initiatives and leaders who stand firmly with them. While voters embraced bold action, six Democrats buckled under pressure, abandoning families in need for nothing in return.\n\nIf leaders in Washington fail to match the courage of the people, the hope that they built after the elections may quickly vanish. California cannot allow it. We must seize the moment and continue in the vein of optimism and determination that voters so clearly demanded.\n\nCalifornia has a responsibility to lead. While Washington spirals from crisis to crisis, our state can model a government that works for the people. We’ve already heard from community leaders and organizers in states from Arizona to Georgia that they’re proud of the work California is advancing, while some of their own leaders cave to Trump’s pressure. They see in California a blueprint—proof that courage can win! \n\nBut delivering for voters requires courage from all corners of the Democratic Party. The shutdown may be over, but the lesson is clear—when Washington fails, California is ready to lead. Californians fought hard for the wins on election night. Now it’s our job to fight just as hard for them. Let’s give them what they want and lead the way. \n\nAssemblymember Ash Kalra represents California’s 25th Assembly District, which encompasses the majority of San José, including downtown and open space areas in southeast Santa Clar...",

        "text": "Democratic strategist James Carville demanded Democrats start embracing a platform of \"economic rage\" in a New York Times guest essay published Monday, urging the party to leave \"performative woke politics\" in the past. \"It is time for Democrats to embrace a sweeping, aggressive, unvarnished, unapologetic and altogether unmistakable platform of pure economic rage. This is our only way out of the abyss,\" Carville wrote, citing the recent Democratic victories in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City. Carville said Democrats would continue to hold onto urban and suburban voters, but need to reconnect with voters who give Republicans an advantage in rural regions. He said the party needed to stay on message in angrily opposing the \"the unjust economic system\" that has increased utility bills and kept prices high. THE FAR LEFT HAVE TAKEN CONTROL OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY PLATFORM, AND IT'S TURNING VOTERS OFF \"It cannot be said enough: The era of performative woke politics from 2020 to 2024 has left a lasting stain on our brand, particularly with rural voters and male voters. The term Latinx was despised even by many Latino people. Calling folks \"BIPOC\" should have never been a thing. 'Defund the police' was a terrible idea,\" Carville said. \"We can no longer be a party with a whiff of moral absolutism,\" he continued. \"We can correct this only by looking toward the future, always, in every situation possible, and pivoting to a form of economic rage as our response.\" Carville called for a simple message that included increasing the federal minimum wage to $20 per hour, offering \"free public college tuition,\" expanding rural broadband as a public utility, and universal childcare. He cited Americans’ frustration with higher electricity and gas bills.

We’ve already lost enough of them by being afraid to try. The era of half-baked political policy is over,\" the Democratic strategist continued. New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, made free childcare a focal point of his mayoral campaign.

        "text": "New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani vowed to keep the city's status as an immigration sanctuary city on Sunday, just days after his friendly meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House. Mamdani confirmed his stance on the issue during a speech at a church in the Bronx on Sunday, telling parishioners that he and Trump did not see eye-to-eye on the issue. \"I shared with the president directly that New Yorkers want to follow the laws of our city, and the laws of our city say that, in our sanctuary city policies, city government can be in touch with the federal government on around 170 serious crimes. The concern comes from beyond those crimes, the many New Yorkers who are being arrested, they're being detained, they're being deported for the crime of making a regular court appearance.\" \"My focus as the next mayor of this city is going to be to protect immigrants who call this city their home,\" he added. MAMDANI REVEALS WHICH DEM CITIES ARE 'MODEL FOR HOW TO FIGHT' TRUMP ADMIN IN NYC Reporters pressed Mamdani on the issue during a gaggle outside the church Sunday, but the mayor-elect declined to speculate about how Trump would react to his policies. \"I’ll let the president speak for himself, but I did make very clear that our focus comes back to public safety, delivering for each and every New Yorker and knowing that there may be disagreements between the president and myself, and there will continue to be,\" Mamdani said. \"And I will always make the case for each and every person that calls this city home,\" he added. DAVID MARCUS: MR. MAMDANI GOES TO WASHINGTON BETWEEN ROCK AND HARD PLACE Mamdani's statements come after he and Trump appeared to forge a new path for their relationship as they found common ground on affordability issues and improving conditions in New York. Trump admitted that the two had more in common than he thought — despite their different views — and that he would be \"cheering\" for Mamdani as he leads the city.

        "text": "More details and contradictory information emerged over the weekend about a broad, 28-point framework for a prospective Russia-Ukraine peace deal. Initial reporting suggested this was a U.S.-devised plan, which President Donald Trump had given Ukraine until November 27 to accept, but the president said on Saturday that it was not his “final offer” to Ukraine. A bipartisan group of U.S. senators said Saturday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio told them during a conference call that the White House did not propose the deal, and it was—per Angus King—a “wish list of the Russians.” Rubio went on to refute this characterization, and a State Department spokesperson said the claims were “blatantly false.” Rubio and other White House officials met with senior diplomatic and security officials from Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the European Union in Geneva on Sunday to discuss terms, with Rubio describing the summit as the Trump administration’s “most productive and meaningful meeting” with Ukraine this year. When details of the plan first emerged last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the situation in a Friday video address as his country facing the choice of either “losing its dignity or the risk of losing a key partner.” That same day, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russian officials were still waiting for the U.S. to share an official proposal, but that the Kremlin is open to “peace negotiations.” Russian forces launched a drone attack on Ukraine’s Kharkiv region last night, killing at least four. \n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) killed Hezbollah’s military chief of staff, Haytham Tabatabai, during an airstrike yesterday targeting a multi-story building in the Lebanese capital city of Beirut that Israel believed to be housing terrorist infrastructure. On Saturday, the IDF launched strikes against Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip, killing at least five senior members of the terrorist organization, according to the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israeli officials said their forces moved ahead with the strikes after Hamas militants opened fire on Israeli soldiers. Hamas initially told mediators that Israel’s strikes could mean the end of the ongoing truce, but a spokesperson for the terror group disputed that claim later that day. Meanwhile, the Associated Press reported that Netanyahu convened a cabinet meeting to address the rising violence from Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank. On Sunday, Israeli government prosecutors filed terrorism-related criminal charges against one Israeli teenager who allegedly attacked Beit Lid, a Palestinian village in the West Bank.\n\nGOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia announced on Friday that she would resign from Congress, effective January 6, 2026, following public attacks from Trump. In a video message, Greene said she decided to avoid a “hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president we all fought for.” On Saturday, Trump posted on Truth Social that “Marjorie went BAD,” describing his now-former ally as a “traitor.” That same day, Trump told reporters that he “disagreed with her philosophy” but added that Greene is a “nice person.” Greene said in an X post on Sunday that she had no intention of launching a presidential campaign, stating that she “laughed at” such speculation. Greene announced in July that she would not run for governor of Georgia in 2026, but has not commented on the race since then. “If I wanted to run we all know I would win,” she tweeted at the time. “It’s not even debatable.”\n\nNew York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani met with Trump at the White House on Friday, with the discussion surprisingly positive and friendly. The president said he is “very confident that [Mamdani] can do a good job,” adding that the mayor-elect’s tenure may “surprise some conservative people.” The two spoke with reporters from the Oval Office later that day, and, when one reporter asked Mamdani whether he still believed Trump to be a fascist, the president intervened, and stated, “That’s okay, you could just say, ‘Yes,’” adding that “it’s easier than explaining it.” On Sunday, Mamdani said he stood behind his past comments. Talking to the press after the meeting, Trump said he disagreed with Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik’s claim that Mamdani is a “jihadist,” adding that Stefanik—who is currently running for governor of New York—was just “out there campaigning.” Trump had previously threatened to pull federal funding to New York City should Mamdani win the election earlier this month, but White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday that “it feels like he [Trump] doesn’t mean it now,” adding that “we’ll have to wait and see what Mamdani does” and noting that the White House was pleased with Mamdani’s decision to retain the city’s incumbent police commissioner, Jessica Tisch.\n\nGunmen in Nigeria continue to hold hostage 253 students—between 10 and 18 years old—as well as 12 teachers, following their attack on a Catholic school on Friday. They had initially taken 303 children hostage, but 50 escaped captivity on Friday and Saturday. An armed group attacked another church last Wednesday in Nigeria’s western Kwara region, killing two people and also taking hostages. Nigerian officials announced that many public schools will be temporarily closed amid the recent violence. Pope Leo XIV has called for an “immediate release” of all hostages.",

        "text": "In the United States, an unexpected style war has gone viral on social media. where Donald Trump, the current US President, stepped out in a winter look that left many people convinced he was channeling or even copying Zohran Mamdani, New York City's mayor-elect.\n\nBut it is the timing of the pictures right after their first in person meeting at the White House that has only increased the rumours, making jokes, memes, and lively online debate.\n\nA Viral Fashion Moment: Trump Copying Mamdani?\n\nJust a short while after meeting Zohran Mamdani at the White House on November 21, Donald Trump was clicked wearing a burgundy scarf tucked neatly under an oversized black overcoat, and it wasn't the usual Trump winter wardrobe. He looked more refined, more composed and the internet noticed. Moreover, X (formerly Twitter) blew up with side by side comparisons of Trump's new look and Mamdani's previous outfits. As some reports put it, users claimed he was 'copying Zohran Mamdani's style.'\n\nOne popular tweet even joked that 'It's called 'the Mamdani'. Trump dressed up for his crush.' Furthermore, some shared old photos of Mamdani in similar burgundy knits and dark outerwear, playing into the theory that the resemblance was more than coincidental. And others pointed out that a doctored image of Mamdani which was recolored to mimic Trump's look may have helped set the meme making machine in motion as even Obama's picture in a similar outfit was pulled out.\n\nStill, the style going viral is rooted in more than fashion. It comes on the heels of a meeting that many expected to be combative but turned out to be surprisingly warm.\n\nREAD MORE: Why Did Donald Trump Dump £65 Million Into Bonds Since August\n\nTrump Meets Mamdani\n\nThe meeting between Donald Trump and Zohran Mamdani was not just symbolic, it showed a genuine softening of tone from both sides. As just months ago, the two had dished out sharp insults when Trump reportedly labeled Mamdani a 'communist lunatic' while Mamdani in return reportedly called Trump a 'fascist'\n\nBut on that November day in the Oval Office, things shifted it seems. According to reports, they discussed major issues affecting New Yorkers like housing affordability, grocery costs, utilities, and public safety. Trump was unexpectedly complimentary, calling Mamdani's campaign 'incredible' and saying he'd feel 'very comfortable' living in a New York City run by him. Mamdani seemingly agreed, calling the meeting productive and focused not on their ideological fights but on common ground for New Yorkers.\n\nStill, Zohran Mamdani didn't back down from his previous criticism. During another interview as per reports, he reaffirmed his belief that Donald Trump is a 'fascist' and a 'despot', insisting that his old views remain unchanged, even as he expresses willingness to cooperate. Trump, for his part, didn't flinch when Mamdani repeated those labels, he told him it was 'okay,' joking that it was easier than explaining everything during the White House press brief.\n\nAnd then this mix of tension and cooperation led to something curious and, for many online, hilarious with Trump seemingly borrowing Mamdani's aesthetic.\n\nSo, is Donald Trump actually copying Zohran Mamdani? The truth likely lies somewhere in between. On one hand, the timing of Trump's style change with the burgundy scarf, black overcoat which came right on the heels of a warm meeting, made for a great meme. Social media users were quick to laugh, joke, and speculate that Trump's stylist was taking notes. Some pointed out that the viral comparisons might even involve edited or mismatched photos of Mamdani, meaning the resemblance could be exaggerated.\n\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK",

That's fair game. \n\nOn Sunday's Meet the Press, \"moderator\" Kristen Welker lunged for the extremes. She nudged Mamdani to repeat his smear that President Trump is a fascist. This wasn't a question designed to challenge the guest, or even elicit an answer. It was a request to repeat a smear for everyone to hear. Trump is like Hitler, eager to fill the gas chambers. It's a weird take when your guest hosted Hamas backers at his victory party.\n\nLeftists hated that Trump and Mamdani were civil in the Oval Office. “In that press conference with President Trump, a reporter asked you whether you believe that President Trump is in fact a fascist, a word that you’ve used in the past,” Welker said. “You were about to answer. Then, President Trump sort of jumped in. And he said, ‘That’s okay. You can just say yes. It’s easier than explaining it.’ So, Mr. Mayor-Elect, just to be very clear, do you think that President Trump is a fascist?”\n\nOn @MeetThePress, @kwelkernbc cued up Zohran Mamdani to affirm he thinks President Trump is a fascist: “A reporter asked you whether you believe that President Trump is, in fact, ‘a fascist,’ a word that you’ve used in the past.

I say it today. And I think what I appreciated about the conversation that I had with the president was that we were not shy about the places of disagreement, about the politics that has brought us to this moment. And we also wanted to focus on what it could look like to deliver on a shared analysis of an affordability crisis for New Yorkers.\n\nEven this wasn't enough for Welker. She had to double down in the Tyrant Olympics: \n\nWELKER: You've also said in the past that President Trump has engaged in a, quote, \"attack on our democracy.\" You've called him a “despot.” Do you still believe President Trump is a threat to the democracy?\n\nMAMDANI: Everything that I've said in the past, I continue to believe. And that's the thing that I think is important in our politics, is that we don't shy away from where we have disagreements, but we understand what it is that brings us to that table, because I'm not coming into the Oval Office to make a point or make a stand. I'm coming in there to deliver for New Yorkers.\n\nWelker wanted to elicit Mamdani's sincere answer that Trump is an existential threat to democracy. It doesn't matter that he's been elected president twice and we still have a democracy. Then they insist they are \"fact-based\" -- and not fear-based.",

Mamdani fudged the answer and Posobiec got a second moment of glory when Fox News put him on air to discuss it. \n\nWorld Socialist Web Site ⬇ \n\nThey were already furious with Mamdani for keeping NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch in place. The convivial meeting with Trump was just too much to handle.\n\nHouse GOP ⬇\n\nEighty-six Democrats, many in swing districts, joined the GOP in voting for a resolution condemning socialism before the Mamdani-Trump meeting. The GOP had a chance to tie Mamdani to every Democrat in the midterms.

        "text": "For the past three years—following an amendment to the state constitution and authorization by the State Legislature—nearly a dozen developers and gambling companies have been jockeying to win three new licenses to open casinos in and around New York City. In the early days, several firms worked up preliminary proposals: a casino atop Saks Fifth Avenue’s midtown flagship store, a casino in Coney Island, a casino in Hudson Yards. New York would become the new Las Vegas; the winner would receive, as one insider put it, “a license to print money, literally.” To gin up good will, developers promised the moon and the stars: new public bathrooms and new public parks, more bike lanes, a concert hall, a museum, surveillance drones, thousands of union jobs, affordable housing, even a meeting with Beyoncé.\nNevertheless, locals opposed many of the proposals before they could even be submitted to the state. The casino company founded by Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas magnate portrayed in “Ocean’s Eleven,” pledged nearly two hundred million dollars for community programs. But not even two hundred million dollars was enough. This past May, on the same sunny morning that Jay-Z met with lawmakers in Albany to discuss his own casino plan—to convert the building above the Broadway theatre where the “Lion King” plays into a six-billion-dollar gambling complex—Wynn Resorts withdrew its proposal, admitting that it could not muster enough public support.\nThat month, at a high-school gymnasium in Hell’s Kitchen, Mayor Eric Adams held a community-affairs meeting with some constituents and local officials. Under consideration: homelessness, violent crime, scaffolding (“I hate scaffolding,” the Mayor said), domestic violence, e-bikes, lead pipes, and rumors about the forced relocation of some senior citizens living in affordable housing. Just before the meeting concluded, a woman stood up, took a microphone, and looked directly at the Mayor. “I’m concerned about all the discussions of casinos coming to New York City—and particularly in this neighborhood,” she said. For many residents, the plan spelled disaster: the lights, the noise, the crime, the traffic, the drugs, the drunk and degenerate and desperate gamblers wandering the streets at every hour of the day and night. “Is there something we can do to stop that?” the woman went on.\n“It’s not a done deal,” the Mayor said, then rambled for a little while. “It’s imperative that everyone comes out and sit down, and be part of the process to voice your concerns.”\nEvery project had a committee, and every committee had among its members representatives from the offices of several local politicians, Governor Kathy Hochul, and the Mayor. Some local politicians were supportive; others much less so. The Governor and the Mayor, for their part, supported every proposal in New York City, often over the objections of City Council members. In mid-July, the City Council struck down a plan to build a casino in the Bronx—at the site of a golf course that had until recently been operated by the Trump Organization—before it could even get to the community-advisory committee. (The Council refused to approve a necessary zoning change.) The Mayor vetoed the Council’s decision. “This is not an endorsement or expression of support giving a leg up to any casino bid over the others,” he insisted. “May the best applications win.”\nOn a humid day in September, hundreds of people gathered at a Broadway theatre for the second and final so-called public-input hearing for the project spearheaded by Jay-Z. Roc Nation, his sprawling entertainment company, had proposed, in partnership with Caesars Entertainment and SL Green Realty Corp., a casino that would bring to the neighborhood a hotel with nine ultra-luxury sky villas, a two-story night club, three thousand one hundred and forty-six slot machines, and a V.V.I.P. lounge, “the crown jewel of the vertical stack.”\nThe meeting, which was held by the community-advisory committee, lasted six hours. An unlikely alliance of supporters—a co-founder of the Blue Man Group, the former N.Y.P.D. commissioner Bill Bratton, Reverend Al Sharpton—spoke in support of the project. Bratton said, “It is not crime and mayhem that will be coming. It will be more jobs, more profit, and more safety for everybody.” Sharpton said, “Police Commissioner Bratton and I have not agreed throughout our career. I don’t even think we agree today is Thursday. But we both agree: it’s not gonna bring crime.” Other attendees spoke about the new union jobs, the economic benefit, and, as one bespectacled woman put it, “thoughtfulness from an environmental standpoint.” Still, many more were opposed.\nAn elderly woman wearing a “NO TIMES SQUARE CASINO” T-shirt said, “Yes, it might be good for some people, but it’s not gonna be good for any of the residents who are here.”\nA big, bald man said, “Casinos are exploitative.”\nA gray-haired guy reading from a clipboard said, “The two worst places I’ve ever been are Atlantic City and Las Vegas. Both are ugly and depressing, and I grew up in Florida, so that’s saying something.”\nAt one point, someone grabbed a microphone and shouted, “We are not going to shout down and boo people speaking!” At another, Sharpton said, “If somebody want to boo, I’ve been booed by the best, so take your best shot.” Sixteen public-input hearings—two for each casino proposal—were held across town. They often got heated and contentious. At the Y.M.C.A. gymnasium in Coney Island, police officers had to break up at least two fights between the project’s supporters and opponents; several locals alleged that developers had paid people eighty dollars apiece to speak favorably about the casino, and one of them said there were secret audio recordings to prove it. (The New York Gaming Commission did not investigate these allegations, claiming that it was not in their purview.) When, at a hearing in Queens, the executive director of a group called the Chinese American Parents Association spoke in favor of the proposal to build a Hard Rock casino near Citi Field, someone else shouted, “Sellout!”\n“Who said ‘sellout’?” Larinda Hooks, a State Assembly member, said. She was in charge of the hearing, and had sponsored a bill in the State Legislature that allowed the casino to be constructed atop the baseball field’s fifty acres of parking lots, which are technically city parkland. (Steve Cohen, the hedge-fund mogul who owns the Mets, spent, along with his development partners, more than two and a half million dollars lobbying state lawmakers last year.) Immediately, a young woman hoisted a handmade “FOLLOW THE $!” sign even higher into the air.\nHooks shouted, “Security, please! The young lady in the red sweater, please, has to be removed.”\nAfter the public hearings this summer, the committees began to make their decisions. Jay-Z’s casino bid for Times Square was the first to fail. Afterward, in a meeting room filled with reporters, Marc Holliday, the C.E.O. of SL Green, the real-estate company associated with the bid (and one of the largest landlords in New York City), approached the committee members and began shouting, “Go run and hide! The benefits you denied this community, and this city, and state—you have to live with that history forever.” Minutes later, in the same room, another committee rejected Silverstein’s proposal, and, in the following days, yet another committee killed a proposal to build Freedom Plaza—an eleven-billion-dollar casino complex backed by the head of a private intelligence firm—on Manhattan’s East Side, near the United Nations. Within a week, all the Manhattan casinos were dead.\nMeanwhile, in Queens, another committee gathered in another committee room, to vote on a proposal by Resorts World, which already operates the racino near J.F.K. “Sorry, Jay-Z. We win again,” Donovan Richards, Jr., who is the Queens borough president, said, as he cast his vote in favor of the proposal. “I just had to rub that in.” The vote was unanimous; the audience burst into applause. Afterward, Richards embraced several executives.\nI walked out of the meeting with one of them: Robert DeSalvio, who oversees Resorts World. He was headed toward the racino, where a celebration would be held later that evening. “I think we proved that we’re a good neighbor,” he told me. “And you know how hard that is.” I decided to stop by Resorts World, too. As I approached in an Uber, my driver, who lives nearby, said, “I feel so much negativity towards this place. Everyone’s gambling!”\nInside, I watched for a while as a woman wearing Crocs stuffed hundred-dollar bills into a “TRIPLE SUPREME EXTREME” slot machine with a sign that announced a “$12,246.18 JACKPOT.” Then I sat down at a “WHEEL OF FORTUNE” machine to try my own luck. Right away, I won twenty dollars—and then lost it all. The afternoon passed quickly: I lost more, I won big, I again lost everything but five cents. Refusing defeat, I stuffed more money into a slot machine. Eventually, against all odds, the machine began whizzing and whirring and making noises that my body immediately associated with success: I had won fifty dollars! Somehow, I mustered the sense to cash out.\nIf Resorts World wins one of the new gaming licenses, the racino will be allowed to add two thousand five hundred more slot machines, seven hundred live table games, thirty restaurants, a thousand six hundred hotel rooms, and a seven-thousand-seat arena to the existing complex. (Under the current licensure, live dealers are forbidden; the gambling games at Resorts World are technically “video lottery terminals,” not slot machines.) “We think we have a terrific application,” DeSalvio had told me. “We have all the permits—all the environmental permits, the building permits. We can be up and running by next March.” He grinned and went on, “We’ll have to train a lot of local folks how to be dealers.”\nThree other casino bids made it through their community-advisory committees: a project proposed by M-G-M to expand another existing racino, in Yonkers; the Bally’s proposal, at the old Trump golf course; and Steve Cohen’s Hard Rock casino, in the Citi Field parking lot. In late September, at the committee meeting that approved the Citi Field project—Metropolitan Park, as it’s known—Steve McCann, a union leader from Queens, told me, “It’s supposed to create thousands of construction jobs. I’m not opposed to rich corporations that want to spend money, if they want to use union labor.”\nAfter the vote, P. J. O’Doherty, another union leader from Queens, who has spent the past thirty-five years pouring concrete, told me, “Listen, people complain about gambling and the casinos and all that, but see what I have right here?” He pulled out his iPhone. “You can go on your phone and gamble like crazy, if you want. You can lose everything, and you don’t even have to leave the house.”\nI asked him if he’d visit the new casino. “I worked too hard for my money,” he said, with a laugh. “But I’ll go there—it’s more than gambling!” Most supporters of the casinos with whom I spoke seemed more interested in talking about the new construction jobs, the new high-end restaurants, the new hotel rooms and concert venues, and the millions of dollars in community investment than about the actual gambling that would occur there. DeSalvio, of Resorts World, told me, “I work in the business, so I don’t gamble.” Soo Kim, the Bally’s chairman, told me, “I don’t gamble.” Vicki Been, the chairwoman of New York’s Gaming Facility Location Board, which will decide which applicants advance to the final review by the state, told a reporter this summer that she had never been to a casino. “That’s nowhere I want to spend my time,” she said.\nLast year, Richards, the Queens borough president, said, “People absolutely will be hurt with a casino being in close proximity. But our jobs are to make sure that we are minimizing it as much as possible.” (More recently, he told me, “The target audience is the tourists!”) The negative and positive effects of casinos on communities have been well documented in academic literature. New casinos are often followed by a boost in economic activity, increased property values, and additional tax revenue for state and local governments. (Over the next decade, New York stands to make some twenty billion dollars in revenue from the three new casino licenses, with much of the money earmarked for schools and public transportation.) New pawnshops and payday lenders in the surrounding area also follow the construction of a new casino—as does a population’s increased vulnerability to problem gambling, which can in turn lead to substance abuse, psychiatric issues, obesity, arthritis. When I told Kim, who bought Donald Trump’s golf-course lease in the Bronx for sixty million dollars specifically to pursue the casino project, that I was generally wary of casinos because of the harm they might cause, he told me, “We are philosophically the same, because you cannot kill your customers. It’s bad for business.”\nKim purchased the lease—the city of New York owns the land on which the casino would be built—from Trump with a provision in the contract that, if the casino moves forward, Trump would receive another hundred and fifteen million dollars. “That’s a small price to pay,” Kim said. “The community got a better deal than Trump. Think about all the jobs, the money—it’s billions of economic activity.” He went on, “We out-dealed him.”\nNear the fourteenth hole of the course, Kim parked a golf cart and looked around. The Manhattan skyline shimmered in the distance. “I grew up right there, at the base of that bridge,” Kim said, pointing to the far side of the Throgs Neck Bridge, in Queens. “And this”—he looked around, watching for a moment as a man in coveralls trimmed the creeping bent grass on the putting green—“this was, like, where you rode your dirt bikes and dumped dead bodies and set off fireworks.” Kim settled on the Trump course in part because of its proximity to the freeway. “Look, I love the subway. I grew up on the subway. But people don’t ride the subway to the casino,” he explained.\nZohran Mamdani, the incoming mayor, who has said that he is personally opposed to casinos (“Gambling is haram,” he once quipped), clarified on the campaign trail that he wouldn’t do anything to stop them. Brian O’Dwyer, the chair of the New York Gaming Commission, which will award the licenses by the end of the year, said, “The question is, Who does best for the community—and the state of New York in terms of tax revenues?” Each casino promises to generate billions of dollars in taxable revenue a year: Bally’s, one and a half billion; Resorts World, roughly four billion; the Hard Rock complex near Citi Field, nearly four billion. But other criteria—the casinos’ effects on neighborhood traffic, diversity-equity-and-inclusion initiatives for new jobs, efforts to assist gambling addicts—will also be assessed.\nIn mid-October, M-G-M withdrew its bid for the casino complex in Yonkers, citing uncertainty that it could earn as much money as had initially been proposed. Mike Spano, the mayor of Yonkers, was outraged. “Something doesn’t add up here,” he said, demanding that Governor Hochul launch an investigation. “People need to be assured that there is no linkage between M-G-M’s decision and the massive financial benefit to Donald Trump.” (With M-G-M out of the running, there were three bids for three licenses, increasing the odds that the Trump Organization would get its payout.) Hochul later weighed in: “I, at this time, am not aware of any reason to launch an investigation. I have no evidence to suspect there is any wrongdoing.” When I spoke with Spano this month, he told me that he was now less concerned with potential wrongdoing than with the fallout from Bally’s or Citi Field opening up nearby, which, he said, would likely lead M-G-M to close their Yonkers racino. “We’d lose our largest private tax-payer,” he said, growing emotional. “It’s a loss of, immediately, a thousand jobs.”\nIn late November, members of the gaming board toured the remaining proposed sites in golf carts. As the bidders waited for the verdict, some community members made a last-ditch effort to stop the projects from moving forward. One evening, a protester dressed in a black puffer and a gray beanie, who opposed the Citi Field casino, disrupted an official meeting. “This casino is going to destroy our community,” the protester said, calmly. “You all look like wonderful people. We know that you can do the right thing.” (Afterward, the meeting was closed to the public.) Casino executives and local politicians began to point out that not all three licenses had to be granted—and that maybe their failed bids had a shot, after all. “The whole process and the outcome is still unknown,” Holliday, of the Times Square bid, said, on a recent earnings call. Spano, the mayor of Yonkers, told me, “If they only issue two licenses, maybe we’ll get another bite at the apple!”\nAs Kim pitched me on the project at the golf course—“cashless wagering” at the five-hundred-thousand-square-foot casino, a “polished casual Latino-Caribbean restaurant,” a rooftop bar offering an “elevated social experience infused with a touch of Bronx flair and unmistakable pizzazz”—I thought less about Trump and more about Resorts World, where, at that very moment, hundreds of people were feeding the existing slots. Kim said, “Look, the core customer is a retired woman, and a lot of them have Social Security checks—they’re not using them! That three hundred and eighty dollars doesn’t really change their lives. You know what it is? It’s a relatively cheap thrill. People don’t go to the casino to make money. Obviously, the odds are against you. You go because you like the risk of it—”\nHe paused, mid-thought. His phone rang. He took a quick call, collected himself, and continued, “Sorry, so, yeah, people want to take risk. That’s actually what it is. Most animals want to reduce risk. Human beings don’t have that. They have a gene that wants to take risk—that’s why we jump out of perfectly good airplanes. It’s the thrill of the unknown. And that’s what makes humans so unique. Gambling scratches that itch, but it does so in a very controlled way. It’s just a little bit of money. It’s actually not risk.” He moved his hands slowly as he spoke: “You could lose every dollar of your life, and yet you’d still have your health, and the sun comes up in the morning, and we can all equally enjoy this sunny, beautiful day. I don’t want to be metaphysical, but I’m just saying money isn’t the be-all, end-all.” ♦",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani didn’t back down in an interview that aired Sunday from past criticism that President Donald Trump acted like a despot and a fascist after a surprisingly friendly White House meeting between the two men.\n\nThe newly elected democratic socialist and the Republican president have fiercely criticized each other in the past. Trump called Mamdani a “100% Communist Lunatic” in a social media post following the incoming mayor’s election victory, and Mamdani has said Trump was attacking democracy. Yet the two political foils emerged smiling after the meeting Friday and spoke of shared goals.\n\nPressed about his past criticism during a “Meet the Press” interview conducted Saturday, Mamdani said his views remained unchanged.\n\n“Everything that I’ve said in the past, I continue to believe,” Mamdani said. “And that’s the thing that I think is important in our politics, is that we don’t shy away from where we have disagreements, but we understand what it is that brings us to that table, because I’m not coming into the Oval Office to make a point or make a stand. I’m coming in there to deliver for New Yorkers.”\n\nTrump had brushed aside Mamdani’s criticisms Friday and even jumped in on his defense several times. When a reporter asked if Mamdani stood by his comments that Trump is a fascist, Trump interjected before Mamdani could fully answer the question.\n\n“That’s OK. You can just say yes. OK?” Trump said. “It’s easier. It’s easier than explaining it. I don’t mind.”\n\nAsked about the fascist criticism on “Meet the Press,” Mamdani said, “That’s something that I’ve said in the past. I say it today. ”\n\nKevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” talk show that Trump wants to work with everybody who cares about the future of the American people.\n\n“We’re at times disagreeing about policies,” Hassett said, “but I think that the objective of making life better for everybody is something that a lot of people share on the Democratic and Republican side.”\n\nThough far apart politically, the White House meeting offered potential political benefits for both men. The incoming mayor was able to meet one-on-one with the president, and Trump got to to talk about affordability, an issue that is increasingly important to voters.",

What was supposed to be an annual $2.6 million ended up costing taxpayers $104 million a year, with sizable portions of the money being sent back to the Al-Shabaab terrorist group in Africa. One confidential source told City Journal, “The largest funder of Al-Shabaab is the Minnesota taxpayer.”\n\nThis all comes after federal and Minnesota taxpayers were fleeced by the Feeding Our Future program in 2020, where members of the Somali community pocketed hundreds of millions in tax dollars for school lunches that were never provided. \n\nIn Charlotte, Democrats criticized Trump’s Charlotte’s Web immigration enforcement surge, noting that 30,000 students in Charlotte public schools, over 20% of the student body, failed to show up for class during the raid. That truly is an outrageous number, but not in the way Democrats think. If 20% of Charlotte public school students come from illegal immigrant households, that means thousands of native-born students are being weighted down with non-English speakers in their classrooms. If anything, the numbers show just how out of control the illegal immigrant population has gotten in some communities, only underscoring the need for deportations.\n\nAnd in New York City, the proud socialist Zohran Mamdani won his election to be mayor in no small part due to his promise to strengthen and expand rent controls. While Mamdani’s rent protections would apply to natives and immigrants alike, it is highly relevant that 40% of all rent-stabilized housing in New York City is occupied by foreign-born residents. Seems New York City’s housing affordability crisis could largely be solved by some much-needed immigration law enforcement.\n\nEnforcing immigration law is a difficult and thankless task. No one likes deporting migrants who have done nothing wrong but enter the country illegally (or illegally stayed past their temporary visa). But if we don’t enforce immigration law and just let everyone stay, then we really do not have a sovereign country. Few people recognize this better than legal immigrants.\n\nAccording to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation/New York Times poll, while 49% of legal immigrant voters said Trump’s deportations made them angry, 46% also said the deportations were “necessary,” including 80% of Republican immigrants and 52% of independent immigrants. Asked in the same poll if the current immigration law was “too tough,” “not tough enough,” or “about right,” 61% of legal immigrant voters chose “about right.”\n\nTrump’s mass deportations may be difficult, but the alternative is a country that tolerates rampant fraud, classrooms overwhelmed by non-English speakers, soaring housing costs, and a foreign-born population growing faster than the nation can absorb. Increasingly, even legal immigrants understand that real sovereignty demands enforcement, not empathy. Restoring order to the immigration system isn’t cruelty; it’s the necessary first step toward restoring strength and stability.",

        "text": "Coffee’s for closers! \n\nAlec Baldwin — the actor who uttered perhaps the most iconic movie line ever about java, and also once publicly railed against a Starbucks worker as an “Uptight Queen barrista [sic]” with an “attitude problem” — is now a contributing producer on a film backing the coffee chain’s workers.\n\nBaldwin appeared last week at a fundraiser and screening for “Baristas vs Billionaires” at Lincoln Center’s Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center. \n\nThe movie by Mark Mori about Starbucks Workers United says it follows a “generational uprising of working-class Millennials and Gen Z as they battle Starbucks Coffee for their right to unionize.”\n\nThe Starbucks union’s current strike has expanded to over 30 locations nationwide, The Post reported, and the latest work stoppage hit a store in Albany, NY, after NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani called for a boycott of the chain.\n\nMori told us that Baldwin got involved by doing voiceovers for sample reels of the doc, and giving feedback on early cuts of the film.\n\nIronically back in September 2011, Baldwin had an apparent run-in with a barista at the coffee chain in Manhattan, leading to some snippy tweets at the time!\n\n“Starbucks on 93 and B’way. Uptight Queen barrista [sic] named JAY has an attitude problem,” the volatile star posted over a decade ago, The Post reported at the time.\n\nBaldwin, 67, followed up the 2011 Twitter tirade by complementing an employee at another NYC establishment.\n\n“Clyde, on the other hand, outside DINOSAUR BARBECUE @ W 125 n H River is MY MAN,” he tweeted. “Keeping the hickory ovens going, he is 2dayz Coolest NYer.” (No documentary on Dinosaur just yet!) \n\nAt the time, another barista told The Post of Baldwin’s Starbucks incident: “I was here when it happened — it was really just [Baldwin] being an [expletive]… He was very rude and disrespectful and arrogant. He’s probably the rudest guy I’ve ever met.”\n\nIt also turned out that Baldwin seemingly got the allegedly offending Starbucks employee’s name, “Jay,” wrong at the time — as there was no one with that handle at the shop. (A colleague said back then that there was a staffer named “Giovan” who probably was the target of Alec’s ire.)\n\n“And he didn’t do anything wrong; it was all that dude just being psycho,” the second brew-slinger reportedly said in 2011. “I saw a thing on [cable channel E!] a little while ago, and it was talking about how crazy he was. They were right.”\n\nBaldwin’s spokesman said at the time in response, “Starbucks is a great company… Unfortunately, not all of their employees can live up to their high standards.”\n\nThe Post also reported that Baldwin had contacted the company’s corporate offices and spoke to a regional manager.\n\nA rep for Baldwin did not return a request for comment about the new film, or the past incident.\n\nEither way, the “30 Rock” star is now standing with the Frappuccino servers!\n\nMori told us: “I’ve known Alec for about 35 years, and we collaborated on two TV projects (“Raw Footage” and “51 Classic Documentaries”) over the years. When we were in the initial stages for ‘Baristas vs Billionaires’ in early 2023, I mentioned the project to Alec and he immediately got involved.”\n\nMori — a 1991 Oscar nominee and 2001 Emmy winner — added of Baldwin, “He also attended our world premiere at Buffalo International Film Festival in October, and he participated in multiple audience Q&As, often citing his father’s work in a teachers union. Alec supports the baristas and their work highlighted in the film.” \n\nThe movie’s playing Buffalo and Santa Fe, NM, before moving to Madison, Wis., and other markets. \n\nBaldwin, of course, made the famed “coffee’s for closers” speech in David Mamet’s classic, “Glengarry Glen Ross” — in a scene that the playwright added for the big screen adaptation.",

You could’ve come here.'” Mayor Mike Spano told The Post. “So I’m going to be upfront and open, and basically send the message to New York that I like billionaires.\n\n“I like billionaires, I like the average Joe, and I’d like you to come to and try Yonkers. If you’re going to leave, come here,” he added.\n\nSpano, a former state lawmaker and ex-Republican, calls himself a “radical moderate” Democrat and said that “when New York City sneezes, we get the cold.” He’s now making his pitch in a splashy “Think Yonkers” video ad.\n\n“Here in Yonkers, we built a city that delivers for businesses, for developments and for the people that matter most,” Spano says in the clip. “So if you’re looking to take your business someplace else, think Yonkers.”\n\nSpano didn’t direct any specific ire towards Mamdani and said he looks forward to meeting with him and working with the administration at some point, but claimed he just wants to get in front of people’s anxieties about New York’s business climate.\n\nMamdani has said he wants the state to OK a tax increase on the wealthy and hike the corporate tax to generate funds for his democratic socialist agenda, which critics fear could drive away businesses for greener — and cheaper pastures.\n\nYonkers’ may provide an option just out of reach of the city subway — with its downtown growing in recent years. Spano touts a focus on housing development while boasting diverse local employers like rail car manufacturer Kawasaki as well as Lionsgate film and television studio.\n\nHe said the Westchester County city — the third-largest in the state — offers “microcosm of New York City” with other built-in perks such as avoiding Big Apple local corporate taxes and other fees on businesses all while remaining 15 miles from midtown Manhattan.\n\n“We saw the future potential even before the situation that just happened,” Hershey Friedman, chair of the board of Azorim, a major real estate developer that’s been building in the city, told The Post.\n\n“The taxes are low. They’ve got everything that a person is looking for. Yonkers is the place, as far as we’re concerned,” he added.\n\nYonkers denizens say they’ve heard the cries of New York’s collapse before.\n\n“It won’t be much different than the mass exodus that happened during COVID,” Amanda Breen, one of the owners of Irish Coffee Shop on McLean Avenue said.\n\n“People bought houses wherever they would find along here and anywhere in Westchester,” she said.\n\nRory Dolan, owner of his namesake Irish Pub & Restaurant in the Yonkers for 32 years as well as other restaurants in New York, told The Post said he’s seen people flee the city before.\n\n“People left town after 9/11 and then maybe after a year go back again. After Covid too,” he said.\n\nBut he thinks the tales of the city’s deaths are greatly exaggerated.\n\n“I came here in 1986. I’ve been around for Koch, Dinkins, Giuliani, Bloomberg, de Blasio, and Adams. It didn’t happen then,” he said.",

        "text": "Donald Trump and Zohran Mamdani, the New York City mayor-elect, walked out of their meeting on Friday afternoon with an unlikely alliance, agreeing to work together on housing, food prices and cost-of-living concerns that have defined both their political appeals to working-class voters.\n\n“We agreed a lot more than I would have thought,” Trump said in the Oval Office, sometimes jumping in to shield Mamdani from aggressive questioning from the press.\n\nThe sit-down – which many had anticipated would be contentious, given months of intense rhetoric in which Trump branded Mamdani a “communist lunatic” – instead produced camaraderie, warm words and concrete pledges of cooperation between the Republican president and the self-described democratic socialist who secured a commanding electoral victory earlier at the beginning of November with over 50% of the vote.\n\n“I feel very confident that he can do a very good job,” Trump said after the meeting, offering praise for his ideological opposite. “The better he does, the happier I am. I will say there’s no difference in party. There’s no difference in anything, and we’re going to be helping him to make everybody’s dream come true, having a strong and very safe New York.”\n\nThe president congratulated Mamdani on his mayoral victory, describing it as “an incredible race against smart people” – and the two politicians shook hands.\n\nTrump added that he had already seen signs the young politician might surprise both conservative and liberal observers alike.\n\nFor Mamdani, the meeting represented vindication of his strategy to focus the discussion on economic issues rather than ideological divides. He described the meeting as “productive” and “focused on a place of shared admiration and love, which is New York City”.\n\n“We spoke about rent, we spoke about groceries, we spoke about utilities, we spoke about the different ways in which people are being pushed out,” Mamdani told reporters after emerging from the Oval Office.\n\nTrump added: “We had some interesting conversation, and some of his ideas really are the same ideas that I have.” He pointed to their agreement on lowering crime and building housing.\n\nThe meeting marked the first face-to-face discussion between the combative Republican president and the defiant democratic socialist.\n\nFor Mamdani, a leftwing state assemblymember until his shock primary victory, the sit-down presented an early test of his ability to negotiate with a president who controls vast federal resources that the city depends upon. Mamdani’s team made the first move in reaching out for a meeting, all while Trump earlier threatened to withhold federal funding from New York if Mamdani took office, though he has since suggested a more conciliatory posture, telling Fox News: “I’m so torn, because I would like to see the new mayor do well, because I love New York.”\n\nThe administration has deployed multiple pressure tactics ahead of the meeting. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have signaled plans to escalate operations in New York City, while a number of rightwing congressional Republicans suggested investigating whether Mamdani’s citizenship is valid, despite his naturalization in 2018 after immigrating from Uganda as a child.\n\nMamdani’s team spent Thursday preparing for the encounter through calls with Kathy Hochul, New York’s governor, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, and the civil rights leader Al Sharpton to strategize the approach. He also spoke with Robert Wolf, the former chief executive of UBS Americas and a known ally of Barack Obama.\n\nWhen asked on Thursday whether he feared receiving hostile treatment similar to the contentious Oval Office meeting between Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, earlier this year – where Trump accused Zelenskyy of “gambling with world war III” – Mamdani brushed aside concerns. “I’ll stand up for New Yorkers every single day,” he replied.\n\nThe incoming mayor had framed the meeting as an opportunity to advance his central campaign platform: making New York more affordable. His promises include free public buses, government-run grocery stores, rent freezes for more than 1m stabilized units, and the city’s first universal childcare program.\n\n“I view this meeting as an opportunity for me to make my case,” Mamdani said on Thursday. “It behooves me to ensure that I leave no stone unturned in looking to make this city more affordable.”\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, similarly said Trump’s willingness to meet was evidence of his openness to dialogue across political divides.\n\n“President Trump is willing to meet with anyone and talk to anyone and to try to do what’s right on behalf of the American people, whether they live in blue states or red states, or blue cities,” Leavitt said.\n\nBut the underlying tensions were not subtle. Trump got directly involved in the mayoral election, dismissing the candidate from his own party, Curtis Sliwa, as a lightweight and instead endorsing Andrew Cuomo, the Independent, formerly Democratic governor, while branding Mamdani a “little communist”. The Trump administration also yanked federal aid for critical infrastructure projects – including the Gateway Tunnel between New York and New Jersey and the Second Avenue subway line – during budget negotiations.\n\nAmong New York voters, Trump garnered only 27% approval compared with 70% disapproval in CNN’s exit polling from the mayoral election. However, 10% of Trump’s 2024 voters also cast ballots for Mamdani, suggesting there is indeed overlap in their populist economic messaging, despite their vast ideological differences.",

        "text": "Sure, we know Mamdani is charming, but so is Barack Obama, another leader Trump has spent friendly-seeming time with, even as he falsely accuses Obama of treason. So it's got to be more than Mamdani's charisma. Here, we offer up five theories to explain what Vanity Fair's Aidan McLaughlin described as a “lovefest.”\nTrump is powerless in the presence of a beard\nName the powerful bearded politician who made these comments about Donald Trump:\n\n“Trump is a cynical asshole … he’s America’s Hitler.”\n“I don’t think he actually cares about folks.”\n”He’s noxious and is leading the white working class to a very dark place.\"\n\nTed Cruz? No, I said “powerful.” It's Vice-Presdent J.D. Vance! Before Friday, the only things Vance and Mamdani had in common were a track record of Trump opposition and a beard. After Friday, they could add Trump's glowing praise to the list of commonalities. Fox News host Brian Kilmeade might be on a similar track as I am, saying “I think J.D. Vance is jealous\" as he discussed Friday's event.\nTrump watched Heat Thursday night\nEveryone agrees that the coffee shop meeting between Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's characters is the most indelible scene in Michael Mann's classic 1995 film Heat. Nemeses in the same room, the grudging respect between hero and villain, the growing understanding that the opposites are far more alike than they realized…it's one of the world's most compelling narratives, from Batman and the Joker to the horseshoe theory.\nMamdani looked in Trump's left eye\nAccording to the New York Post, which appears to be where most of Middle America gets their Zohran Mamdani news, MIT prof Tara Swart says that mothers and their babies bond using right eye to left eye contact. “Most people are right-handed so they’ll be holding their baby in their left arm, so they can use their dominant hand to do stuff,\" she says. “That means when you gaze at your baby, your right eye is looking at their left and then that interaction from the optic nerve is going around the brain.” According to Swart, that eye contact creates an “emotional resonance loop that’s part of how the mother and baby bond.” So, if we assume that Trump was able to keep his eyes open during the private meeting he had with Mamdani prior to the press event, Mamdani might have been able to provide the president with enough maternal good vibes to briefly counteract Trump's awful-sounding upbringing by Fred Trump.\nSome Mamdani-loving billionaire got on the horn\nLong branded a horrific hellhole by Fox News, San Francisco has been bracing for Trump to deploy the National Guard to the famously liberal town since he started rolling troops into Democrat-led cities earlier this year. In October, the incursion seemed inevitable—that is, until a couple oligarchs, including billionaire Salesforce founder Marc Benioff and billionaire Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, called Trump and told him to stand down. Trump complied.\n“One of the things that President Trump is really good at is he’s a really good listener,” Huang told the SF Chronicle about the call. “If you appeal to him, logically, pragmatically, with common sense, he will listen.” Benioff's Mamdami-aligned creds have recently taken a beating, but it wasn’t that long ago that he backed a hefty tax on large corporations to generate funds to fight homelessness. And Benioff was a White House guest on Tuesday, at the president's dinner to fete Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. An ideal time, perhaps, to take the president aside and suggest a warm and friendly approach.\nDonald Trump has been engaging in the greatest long con of all time\nRemember when Donald Trump was on Sex and the City? When he donated to Kamala Harris's campaign when she ran for California Attorney General? When he told CNN “I probably identify more as a Democrat…And it just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats than the Republicans”? Some pundits describe his remarkable change in position as a set of craven flip-flops, a symptom of someone who lacks a belief in anything but power, or a sign of “accelerating cognitive decline.”\nBut Occam's Razor is overrated! What if, as Mamdani's election rival Curtis Sliwa claimed last night, “we all got played”? Is Trump about to reveal himself as a deep cover mole for The Resistance? It's 2025, don't rule it out.",

An owner of 12 golf courses inside the U.S., Trump said the government-operated courses were \"in very bad shape.\"\n\nHe also took time to swing again at departing Georgia congresswoman Greene, the day after her Nov. 21 nighttime resignation announcement. \"I just disagreed with her philosophy,\" Trump told the press.\n\n\"She started backing perhaps the worst Republican congressman in our history, you know the stupid person named Massie,\" Trump added on the South Lawn. \"I said go your own way and once I left her, she resigned because she never would've survived a primary, but I think she's a nice person.\"\n\nMore: GOP lawmaker hits back after Donald Trump appears to knock his marriage\n\nGreene will exit the House of Representatives on Jan. 5 next year. \"I'm going back to the people I love, to live life to the fullest as I always have,\" she said on social media. Earlier that day, Trump faced widespread online discourse following his embrace of New York mayor-elect Mamdani during an Oval Office meeting Nov. 21.\n\nTrump charts a new course with Mamdani?\n\nTrump once called for Mamdani to be arrested if he didn't help with the administration's sweeping immigration crackdown and argued against giving federal money to New York over Mamdani's far-left politics. For his part, Mamdani previously called Trump a fascist and said he's ready to take on the president over his immigration policies in an election night victory speech earlier this month.\n\nThe pair's first meeting was originally presumed to be contentious but left Trump content. \"I expect to be helping him, not hurting him – a big help,\" Trump said, \"because I want New York City to be great.\"\n\nMore: Are the rich fleeing Mamdani’s Manhattan? Not according to the data.\n\n\"He wants to see housing go up, see a lot of housing created, apartments built... People would be shocked, but I want to see the same thing,\" the president said. A colorful change of heart on Trump's table, and underneath his coat, less than a week before American families scarf down their Thanksgiving meals.\n\nContributing: Reuters; Eduardo Cuevas, Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy, Joey Garrison, USA TODAY",

        "text": "When many Democrats on Friday voted in favor of a resolution condemning socialism, New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani was on his way to what turned out to be a surprisingly cordial meeting with President Donald Trump. Asked about the resolution, Mamdani responded: \"I have to be honest with you, I focus very little on resolutions, frankly. I think the focus is on the work at hand. I can tell you I am someone who is a democratic socialist. I've been very open about that. I know there might be differences about ideology, but the place of agreement is the work that needs to be done to make New York City affordable. That's what I look forward to.\" \n\nMamdani has indeed been open about being a democratic socialist, and has even affirmed the label in the context of denying that he is a communist. When he won the Democrat primary in late June, President Donald Trump, less friendly than he was during their Friday meeting, called Mamdani “a 100% Communist Lunatic.” Asked if he really was a communist, Mamdani responded emphatically: “No, I am not. I call myself a democratic socialist, in many ways, inspired by the words of [Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.] from decades ago, who said, ‘Call it democracy or call it democratic socialism: There has to be a better distribution of wealth for all of God’s children in this country.’” \n\nMamdani’s answer, which he has repeated on other occasions as well, actually raised more questions than it answered. The democratic socialist wunderkind invoked Martin Luther King in speaking of the alleged need for a “better distribution of wealth,” but did not explain why the best distribution of wealth isn’t the simple process of someone working, getting fairly compensated for his or her labor, and being able to dispose of that compensation as he or she sees fit. Why must there be government-mandated “distribution” of wealth at all? To talk as if such government action is necessary is to talk like a communist, the very thing Mamdani has repeatedly denied being.\n\nIn fact, the program of the Democratic Socialists of America, to which Mamdani belongs, sounds very much like communism. The Democratic Socialists of America denounce capitalism as a “system designed by the owning class to exploit the rest of us for their own profit” and proclaim: “We want a democracy that creates space for us all to flourish not just survive and answers the fundamental questions of our lives with the input of all. We want to collectively own the key economic drivers that dominate our lives, such as energy production and transportation. We want the multiracial working class united in solidarity instead of divided by fear.”\n\nPeel away the lofty rhetoric, and that’s a call for collective ownership of “the key economic drivers that dominate our lives,” which in practice has always meant government ownership of the means of production — for which Mamdani himself called in 2020. Democratic socialism, then, and communism are essentially identical. \n\nMany people assume, of course, that what distinguishes democratic socialism from communism is that democratic socialism is genuinely “democratic,” while communism aims to implement the dictatorship of the proletariat.= \n\nThis, too, however, is a distinction without a difference. Communist regimes have not infrequently called themselves democratic: think of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Many in the West have taken such names as an exercise in cynical deception, but there is more going on here than just that. In his biography of the founder of the Soviet Union, Lenin: The Man, the Dictator, and the Master of Terror, Victor Sebestyen explains that “Lenin in power had no intention of allowing a free parliament. He may on occasions in the past have written in praise of elections. But he didn’t believe in ‘bourgeois democracy’ on principle and certainly not in practice for a revolutionary state. The dictatorship of the proletariat and the authority of the Soviet were ‘not only a higher form of democracy…[but] the only form of democracy.’”\n\nRelated: Mamdani: Like Father, Like Son\n\nHow could it be otherwise? The dictatorship of the proletariat was the workers’ tool for establishing a just society in which he would finally enjoy what was his due: a “better distribution of wealth,” as Mamdani put it. Thus it was the truest and fullest expression of what democracy really was.\n\nZohran Mamdani is therefore both a democratic socialist and a communist. There is no contradiction between the two. This will become clearer as he settles in as mayor and begins to implement his agenda. Pay close attention, comrades!",

        "text": "Mamdani, an unabashed socialist who routinely positioned himself as a leader of the anti-Trump resistance, now finds himself in a tough position. His base demands ideological purity, but governing New York City means dealing with the realities of… well… governing. The meeting put Mamdani in a tough spot: embrace some pragmatism or risk alienating his left-wing supporters.\n\nThe left’s reaction to the meeting has been a mix of panic and confusion.\n\nTake Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who tried to spin the encounter on CNN’s The Lead. Warren claimed Trump was trying to latch onto Mamdani’s rising profile because he “has a problem with affordability,” and sees Mamdani as the new face of the issue. She argued, “So is it any surprise that Donald Trump wants to stand next to Zohran Mamdani and say, ‘Oh, yeah, we think about things the same way, particularly when it comes to affordability'?” She added, “He’s just trying to take a little of the shine that Zohran Mamdani has and see if he can, you know, rub a little on Donald Trump.”\n\nThat’s a hilarious theory. After four years of unchecked inflation under Trump, inflation is finally getting under control, while wages are going up. For Mamdani, affordability is a talking point. For Trump, it’s actual results.\n\nICYMI: Trump Reacts to MTG's Resignation, and It Is Brutal\n\nHere are the facts: Democrats have no idea why Trump met with Mamdani in the Oval Office and are struggling to understand the move, and seem to consider the possibility that Trump has a strategy. When I first saw the video of the meeting, it reminded me of Trump’s meeting earlier this year with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. The backlash she got from the left was brutal, and won’t do her any favors when she runs for president in 2028. And we all know that she will.\n\nMamdani now faces a similar dilemma: accept Trump’s diplomacy and risk losing his far-left credibility, or reject it and potentially miss out on pragmatic cooperation he needs to run New York City effectively, at a time when his base demands resistance to everything Trump does, which puts Mamdani in a no-win situation.\n\nThe encounter allows Trump to craft an image of a presidential, pragmatic leader extending a hand of cooperation without losing his supporters’ trust. Meanwhile, Mamdani risks appearing too conciliatory, potentially fracturing his support among the radical left, who expected diehard resistance.\n\nMake no mistake about it, contrary to what Sen. Warren said, Trump isn’t hoping some of Mamdani’s shine rubs off on him; he’s looking to rub a little bit of his own shine on Mamdani, and watch the chickens of the left start a pecking party.\n\nDemocrats can pile up excuses, yet the scene speaks for itself. Trump stepped into the moment with a presidential posture and offered an unexpected olive branch. Mamdani now walks a tightrope between ideological purity and governing in the real world. Democrats scramble for explanations. Trump’s instincts continue to set the pace, leaving his opponents completely unprepared.",

        "text": "No other week in Donald Trump’s second presidency has made it clearer that control of the media is now a central MAGA objective. To wrap a remarkable span of days at the White House, he permitted New York City Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani, who was visiting the Oval Office at Trump’s invitation, to reaffirm his assessment that the president is indeed a fascist. Hosting Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday, Trump heaped praise on the strongman tied by U.S. intelligence to the brutal 2018 murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. “We’ve always been on the same side of every issue,” Trump said of bin Salman in front of the gathered journalists, one of whom quickly found herself in the president’s firing line. \n\nABC News reporter Mary Bruce asked Trump about the crown prince’s connection to Khashoggi’s murder and Trump’s reversal on releasing the Epstein files. The president reprimanded her, calling her “insubordinate” and a “terrible person,” and recommending that Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr revoke ABC’s broadcast license.\n\nBeyond the president, other MAGA figures are exerting pressure on major journalistic institutions to place ideological loyalists into key media roles while pushing out dissenting voices: A hallmark of authoritarian control. \n\nThis week Vice President JD Vance revealed that he wants Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of the Post, to hand over control of his newsroom to Matthew Boyle, an editor at the conservative media outlet Breitbart. “I am being dead serious,” Vance said in a Nov. 20 fireside chat with Boyle that was livestreamed on the White House YouTube channel, calling him “the most well-sourced journalist in Washington, D.C.” \n\nShortly after Trump returned to the White House, Bezos announced a “significant shift” of the Post’s opinion page to focus on “free markets and personal liberties.” Vance admitted that he reached out to the publisher then with his recommendation. “I texted Jeff Bezos and I said, ‘If you’re really serious about this, you should just hire Matt Boyle and make him run your entire political reporting shop… Unfortunately for the Washington Post, they did not take my advice.”\n\nIt doesn’t matter that Bezos was unlikely ever to take Vance’s unsolicited recommendation. The vice president’s public flattery of Boyle flaunts the fact that the far-right Breitbart staffer is not a marginal voice. Although he is not in control of the Post’s political coverage, Boyle sat beside the vice president this week as a central ideologue for MAGA’s media takeover movement. Vance’s bragging about his direct political intervention into the Post newsroom is intended to reveal MAGA’s control and normalize backchannel influence.\n\n“We’re doing what’s called journalism,” Boyle said earlier this year of his website, which infamously featured a “Black crime” vertical. The mainstream media, he said, are “doing what’s called propaganda.” His antipathy toward legitimate news outlets isn’t new. In a 2017 speech, Boyle declared that “the goal eventually is the full destruction and elimination of the entire mainstream media…We envision a day where CNN is no longer in business; we envision a day where the New York Times closes its doors.”\n\nWant more sharp takes on politics? Sign up for our free newsletter, Standing Room Only, written by Amanda Marcotte, now also a weekly show on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nThis week, the Guardian reported that Larry Ellison, a major stakeholder in Paramount Skydance — which is owned by his son David — held informal talks with White House officials about a potential CNN takeover. Paramount Skydance is currently trying to force Warner Bros. Discovery, CNN’s parent company, to sell the network to him, Ellison has reportedly floated the idea of firing CNN hosts who are critical of Trump, including Erin Burnett and Brianna Keilar, to sweeten the deal. \n\nSuch an arrangement would undoubtedly thrill Trump, who is widely seen as favoring CNN’s acquisition by Paramount Skydance over an anticipated bid by Comcast. Earlier this year, Paramount Skydance, which owns CBS News, paid the president a $16 million settlement over a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that he claimed was deceptively edited. Meanwhile, Trump has called Comcast chief executive Brian Roberts a “disgrace” to broadcasting.\n\nThe reported push behind closed doors comes after the president publicly demanded the firing of another CNN reporter. In June, correspondent Natasha Bertrand reported on air that an internal intelligence assessment found that U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran’s nuclear program by only a few months. “She should be IMMEDIATELY reprimanded, and then thrown out ‘like a dog,’” Trump posted on Truth Social.\n\nThis week’s revelations made it clear: MAGA’s effort to restructure mainstream media from the inside out is not just focused on the opinion pages, but also on newsrooms themselves. Institutional capture through ownership, power over personnel and regulatory instruments to exert control over mass media is a defining characteristic of fascism. Trump has long referred to the press as the “enemy of the people,” a phrase that has a brutal history with its use by authoritarians including Josef Stalin, Mao Zedong and Nazi propagandists like Joseph Goebbels. The president’s contempt for a free, independent press tells us where his loyalties lie — and what a bleak future could hold.",

Multiple outlets now report that Mamdani directly asked Trump whether he considered himself a fascist. Trump’s response: “If you want to call me that, you can.” Mamdani replied: “Okay.”\n\nAsked to clarify if he thinks Trump is a fascist, before Mamdani can answer, Trump intervenes and laughs it off, saying, “That’s ok. You can just say yes. That’s easier. It’s easier than explaining.” pic.twitter.com/RfKJd6vAs1\n— Kaitlan Collins (@kaitlancollins) November 21, 2025\n\nThe deadpan exchange has ricocheted across social media as a perfect encapsulation of the odd, stiff-smiling dynamic between two politicians who recently spent months raging against each other online.\n\nThe moment caps off a bitter, deeply personal mayoral race in which Trump went all-in for Mamdani’s opponent, Democrat Andrew Cuomo. Trump not only endorsed Cuomo but amplified MAGA-world attacks on Mamdani, who endured relentless online harassment for being Muslim, an immigrant and outspoken on Gaza. Right-wing influencers cast him as “anti-American,” and pro-Israel groups labeled him antisemitic, making Mamdani a daily target for weeks.\n\nThat history is what made this Oval Office meeting — cordial, almost warm — so jarring. Mamdani told reporters his team initiated the meeting because collaboration was possible “so long as it was to the benefit of the eight and a half million people that call this city their home.” He said he and Trump discussed affordability issues: rent, groceries, utilities and displacement pressures on working-class New Yorkers.\n\nDespite having previously called out Trump on his authoritarian policies, Mamdani said he appreciated that the meeting focused less on ideological clashes and more on “the shared purpose … of serving New Yorkers.” Trump, for his part, shrugged off labels like “fascist,” saying, “I’ve been called much worse.”\n\nStart your day with essential news from Salon.\nSign up for our free morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nThe encounter has prompted a wave of analysis: Is this an unlikely policy alignment, a moment of strategic politics, or simply Trump’s recurring fixation on well-liked young male politicians he once attacked? For Mamdani, the “fascist” question may have been a deliberate stress test. For Trump, permitting the label fits his current malleable strongman performance.\n\nEither way, the meeting has already become a defining image of the race: two adversaries emerging from a brutal campaign, suddenly sitting shoulder-to-shoulder in the Oval Office — and agreeing, oddly enough, on what to call the president.",

Thankfully, that keeps those of us who live where it actually gets cold, and are observers of the political shenanigans going on in the United States of America, warm by default.\n\nAs most of you already know, the new hero of the communist/socialist eye is a fella by the name of Zohran Mamdani, who was just elected as New York City Mayor and has yet to take office. He met with President Trump on Friday at the White House, and it was not as much of a cluster, you know, as the mainstream media had hoped for.\n\nMy colleague Jennifer Oliver O'Connell wrote about this historic meeting yesterday, and I suggest you take a look at it (see Art of the Deal: Trump Meets With NYC Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani, Says: 'He's Gonna Change').\n\nHere in the Midwest, we occasionally need to pay attention to what is happening on the \"other left coast\" to get an idea of what may come our way one day soon. Which is where Michigan state Representative David Martin (R-Davison) had some thoughts that I agreed with, and I thought I would explore them here with you all.\n\nFrom his piece in the Detroit News called, The American Dream still outshines socialism, which it does.\n\nRepresentative Martin starts on point with...\n\nSocialism is enjoying a strange resurgence in American politics. New York City’s newly elected mayor, Zohran Mamdani, calls himself a “democratic socialist.” A recent Gallup survey shows that 39% of Americans, including 66% of Democrats and 51% of independents, now say they approve of socialism.\n\nHe's just being nice here. Nobody approves of free stuff if they think, down the line, somebody that they know (or they themselves) is going to have to pay for it.\n\nREAD MORE: Comrade Mamdani's Chinese Help\n\nSocialists Reportedly Pushing Mamdani to Make NYC a BDS Battleground\n\nThe whole idea is that the people who get free things believe that no one they know have to pay the tab. Of course, there are always exceptions to the rule, but that is the general idea behind it. They 100 percent don't believe they'll ever be held accountable, and as long as someone in their very close circle isn't stuck with the bill, either, they do not really care. If that ever changes, all hell will break loose.\n\nMartin continues...\n\nAll of us want to be rewarded for our own efforts. We want the dignity that comes from charting our own path, taking risks, creating value and providing for our families. Under socialism, the connection between effort and reward is weakened or erased altogether. When that happens, initiative withers and opportunities shrink.This point was understood long ago by Frédéric Bastiat, the 19th-century French economist who wrote that “life, liberty, and property do not exist because men have made laws. On the contrary, it was the fact that life, liberty, and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place.” Bastiat recognized that the role of government is to protect our natural rights rather than control them.\n\nFrédéric Bastiat is a name I have only come across before, but now I want to take some time to read his book, The Law, and dig deeper, and possibly learn something. That he is French, and so am I, could not hurt.\n\nWhile some may be shocked that the 47th president of the United States sat down with anybody who has the term \"socialist\" after his name is understandable. Yet, unfortunately, that is the current climate we live in, and to Trump's credit, he realizes this and correctly chose to meet with the future mayor of New York City. \n\nTrump, in a private meeting that he and Mamdani had, was able to size him up, and I'm sure the president took a read of the man to see who was going to be leading his former city. \n\nMaybe, if we are lucky, POTUS had the chance to relay to the soon-to-be mayor a lil nugget that Representative Martin from my home state ended his editorial with...\n\nCapitalism, grounded in liberty and personal responsibility, remains the greatest engine of opportunity the world has ever known. It is still the best path forward for our children, our communities and our country.\n\nCapitalism is STILL the best path forward for the United States of America, and the future mayor of New York just met with one of capitalism's biggest proponents. Let's hope it works.\n\nIf not, then New York City will be roasting more than turkey next Thanksgiving.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy RedState’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

        "text": "Speaking at the Toronto Film Festival on Saturday, film director and New York City icon Spike Lee said he was \"puzzled\" by the cordial Oval Office meeting between President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani during their joint press conference on Friday. Some viewers of Friday's press conference — including Trump critic Lee — were left surprised by the amicable nature of the meeting between the two men, who had been engaged in a war of words since Mamdani emerged as the mayoral front-runner. \"[During the election, Trump] called him a communist and said New York City was going to go down the drain,\" Lee said at the festival's press conference, as reported by Variety. \"I mean, the President said he was going to cut off federal funding. So from the things that were said to this quick turnaround… I’m puzzled.\" TRUMP, MAMDANI SET TO FACE-OFF IN FIRST OVAL OFFICE MEETING — WHAT’S ON THE TABLE The film director continued, recalling the previous warnings from Trump about what would happen to New York City if Mamdani were to win the mayorship. \"When you go back and see what the President said about him, and what would happen to New York City if [Mamdani] won, it just seems… It seems like they somehow found common ground,\" he noted. Turning his attention to others who predicted the city would become a disaster if Mamdani were to become mayor, Lee said, \"There were a lot of people saying if Mamdani won, they were going to leave New York City. Now, I really want the real numbers if anybody actually left!\" In 2024, ahead of the presidential election, Lee called the prospect of Trump’s reelection a ‘doomsday’ scenario. TRUMP PREDICTS 'CIVIL' MEETING WITH MAMDANI DESPITE PAST COMMENTS ABOUT EACH OTHER While many would have expected fireworks during Friday's joint press conference, the pair found unity during their meeting, with Trump telling the media the pair share the mission of a better New York City. \"We have one thing in common,\" Trump said Friday. \"We want this city of ours that we love to do very well. And I wanted to congratulate the mayor. He really ran an incredible race against, you know, a lot of smart people, starting with the early primaries against some very tough people, very smart people. And he beat them, and he beat them easily. And I congratulated him, and we talked about some things in very strong common, like housing and getting housing built and food and prices.\" The president and mayor-elect met at the White House Friday afternoon before opening the Oval Office doors to the media for questions. Trump predicted New York City, his hometown, will get a \"great mayor\" while remarking that the White House would be there to assist.

And we're going to be helping him, to make everybody's dream come true, having a strong and very safe New York.\" Trump remained seated during his press event, while Mamdani stood by his side and fielded a handful of questions. The pair shared a hopeful outlook for the future, with Trump arguing that, despite their political differences, they will work together and also share a handful of priorities, namely affordability and lowering the cost of living for Americans. The mayor-elect added that he was appreciative of the meeting and said it largely focused on how to better New York City and help families struggling with costs.

        "text": "Socialists are still trying to make sense of the surprisingly positive meeting between New York City’s Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and President Donald Trump, with outlets decrying the meeting as a “grotesque love-fest” or highlighting the “gushing” response Trump had to a man he had spent months trying to tear down.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nMamdani’s upset in the Democratic mayoral primary over former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo sent shockwaves throughout the country. After winning the primary in June, Trump denounced Mamdani as a dangerous “communist lunatic” who would destroy New York City, while the left continues to grapple with what Mamdani means for various movements.\n\nMany said Mamdani was effectively promising voters the moon with no way of delivering, and others have criticized him for appearing to walk back several of his campaign promises, such as leaving NYPD Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch in her position. Mamdani also joined Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York in discouraging a primary challenge to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, saying that challenger Chi Ossé, who campaigned for Mamdani, “should remain a councilman” and “focus…right here on New York City.”\n\nThe meeting also took place after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a resolution on Friday morning to condemn “the horrors of socialism,” with a majority of Democrats joining Republicans in support. The resolution passed in a 285-98 vote.\n\nPresident Donald Trump meets with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in the Oval Office of the White House on November 21 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\nWhat To Know\n\nThe meeting between Mamdani and Trump on Friday at the White House garnered national attention as many expected the president to effectively steamroll the novice mayor-elect, only to surprisingly see the pair in the Oval Office smiling and joking with each other—including Trump saying he was okay with Mamdani calling him a fascist because it was “easier than explaining” his view to reporters.\n\nTrump told reporters he would be comfortable living in Mamdani’s New York City, “especially after the meeting,” and that the pair had more in common with their goals and political views than the president had thought.\n\nIn the aftermath of Friday’s meeting, outlet World Socialist Web Site (WSWS) heavily criticized Mamdani for his “grotesque love-fest” with Trump at the White House, which included Mamdani pledging to work with “would-be dictator” Trump.\n\n“This of an administration that is carrying out an unrelenting assault on the working class, slashing food stamps, threatening Social Security and Medicare, destroying public education, waging a war on public health and orchestrating the largest transfer of wealth from the working class to the oligarchy in American history,” Joseph Kishore wrote on WSWS, going on to criticize Mamdani’s response to Trump on immigration, police, and Israel.\n\n“Mamdani bent over backwards to avoid any mild criticism of Trump,” he wrote, adding of the moment when Mamdani was asked about calling Trump a fascist that “Mamdani allowed Trump to respond for him…thus the pair jointly agreed that Trump is a fascist, but that this would be no hinderance to their blooming ‘partnership.'”\n\nMeanwhile, Jacobin, a New York-based socialist magazine, highlighted that Mamdani’s “unmistakable charisma and undeniable popularity” has created “a flurry of contradictory reactions from opponents,” which includes “slapping Mamdani with a seal of approval” after their meeting. \n\n“Mamdani’s political opponents are threatened by his unapologetic democratic socialism, and they’re trying a range of strategies to neutralize it,” Ben Burgis wrote. \n\nBurgis argued that the meeting with Trump was sensible, showing Mamdani is willing to work with the federal government, but that Trump’s “dramatic pivot” might reflect a broader appeal of the mayor-elect’s policies and the dissatisfaction of voters with the state of the country as a whole, something Trump is grappling with amid fluctuating jobs reports and competing analysis about the health of the economy.\n\n“When it comes to the politics of the here and now, though, the plain fact is that most Americans don’t find what democratic socialists are proposing particularly horrifying. And at least for the moment, that puts reactionaries like Trump on the back foot,” Burgis wrote. \n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nNew York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani wrote on X on Friday: “Working people have been left behind in New York. In the wealthiest city in the world, one in five can’t afford $2.90 for the train or bus. As I...",

What’s your reaction to what we saw with this essentially, embrace from the president to the mayor-elect and a back?”\n\nRaskin said, “The House Republicans literally kept the entire House of Representatives in session today for one purpose and one purpose only, which was to vote on their resolution denouncing and deploring the horrors of socialism. They even conscripted Thomas Jefferson and James Madison to the cause, even though they died before the word socialism was even being used. But in any event, while we were being forced to vote on that utterly ridiculous resolution essentially offending all of our allies in Sweden and Denmark and Norway and Finland and so on, the president was praising Mamdani as a great mayor and someone who is very rational and could be dealt with in the meantime. Again, the Republicans in Congress and Donald Trump were moving in completely opposite directions.”\n\n Follow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN",

        "text": "President Donald Trump on Friday welcomed the announcement by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) that she will resign from Congress in January, characterizing the decision as a positive development and signaling no intention to repair their strained relationship.\n\nIn a phone conversation with ABC’s Senior Political Correspondent Abby Scott, President Trump responded to news of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s resignation by saying, “I think it’s great news for the country. It’s great.”\n\nWhen asked if Greene had given him advance notice of her plans, he replied, “Nah, it doesn’t matter, you know, but I think it’s great. I think she should be happy.” When asked about the “rift” between them, Trump remarked, “only between me and her, not her and me,” and indicated he does not currently intend to speak with her, though he wishes her well.\n\nGreene, who was first elected in 2020 and built her brand as an outspoken supporter of Trump and the “America First” agenda, posted her resignation on X, citing disillusionment with both major parties and declaring that “nothing ever gets better” for ordinary Americans. In her statement, she criticized what she described as the bipartisan failure of Washington, DC, to address issues such as rising debt, the outsourcing of American jobs, and a lack of meaningful legislative progress.\n\nTrump’s withdrawal of support, made public last week on Truth Social, preceded this announcement. In the post, he wrote, “all I see ‘Wacky’ Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!” He pointed to a poll advising her not to run for higher office without his endorsement, claiming “she was at 12%, and didn’t have a chance,” and added that she “has told many people that she is upset” he no longer returns her phone calls.\n\nAs Greene exits the House of Representatives, Trump shifted focus during his phone call with ABC’s Abby Scott, redirecting attention to his Oval Office meeting on Friday with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.\n\nTrump called the meeting “great,” and emphasized the “good chemistry” between them. “He couldn’t be nicer,” Trump said of Mamdani.\n\nDuring the meeting, Trump praised Mamdani, saying, “I really think there’s a chance to do a great job,” and added that he would help him. After tossing a question to Mamdani about whether he considers himself the leader of the Democrats, Trump stated, “This is a man that right now, I think, is focused on New York City.”",

But we’ll have to agree to disagree on this one,” wrote Stefanik on X before leaning into an attack she’s repeatedly hurled at Mamdani since his mayoral primary upset in June.\n\n“If he walks like a jihadist If he talks like a jihadist If he campaigns like a jihadist If he supports jihadists, He’s a jihadist. And he’s @KathyHochul ’s jihadist.”\n\nHochul — who declined to endorse Mamdani for months before eventually doing so in September, when she wrote that she’s looking for the next mayor to not “surrender” to Trump — hit back at Stefanik in a live interview on MS NOW.\n\n“She’s full of shit,” Hochul told host Chris Hayes before swiftly checking herself. “I’m sorry. I mean she really is.”\n\nHochul stressed that Stefanik is taking “such an extreme position.”\n\n“She’s even more extreme than Donald Trump. I didn’t think that was possible but she’s succeeded in proving that today,” she said. “She’s out-MAGA’d Donald Trump, the founder of the MAGA movement.”\n\nHochul sarcastically added that she hopes Stefanik is “proud of herself” for “continuing to spew hateful thoughts and deeds” as well as trying to spread more violent, political rhetoric.\n\n“I think it’s disgusting, it’s abhorrent, but that’s who she is and people are seeing this and even the president realized that’s even too far for him.”",

I think he is going to surprise some conservative people actually.”\n\nPerhaps nowhere did the unexpected praise land more awkwardly than in the New York governor’s race where Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik has been relentlessly trying to tie Gov. Kathy Hochul to Mamdani since Hochul endorsed the incoming mayor in September.\n\nImmediately following Friday’s press conference, Stefanik dug in further.\n\nShe posted a short note on X calling Mamdani “@KathyHochul’s jihadist” and saying she’d “have to agree to disagree on this one” with the president — a rare departure from someone whose political identity is largely defined by Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement.\n\nHochul hit back during a Friday night interview with Chris Hayes.\n\n“She's full of sh-t,” Hochul said. “I'm sorry, I mean she really is. This is such an extreme position ... She's even more extreme than Donald Trump. I didn't think that was possible.”\n\nAs for the meeting itself, Hochul said she wasn’t “terribly surprised” by what unfolded.\n\nShe said it was always her hope the president “would see in Zohran Mamdani someone who can lead the city, who is focused on public safety, who is working on affordability and quality of life issues, and to give the president — who is a New Yorker, who cares about the city — the confidence to know that he can lead.”\n\nChris Coffey, a political strategist who worked for Mayor Michael Bloomberg, said Trump’s change of tone was politically expedient – and that it could undermine Stefanik’s gubernatorial bid. Republicans are still shaking off the government shutdown and the Democratic election victories in New York, New Jersey and elsewhere earlier this month.\n\n“And so the political winds have changed a little bit,” Coffey said. “The shutdown was not popular for the Republican Party and [Trump] likes a winner.”\n\nDoubling down on the jihadist line won’t do Stefanik any favors, he added. That sort of rhetoric “plays to the farthest right of the Republican Party. New York is a blue state … And now that the president has expressed a willingness to work with him and validated Mamdani, it makes it a lot harder to rally Republicans.”\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio also noted that the encounter served Trump’s immediate political needs — citing his declining poll numbers and the fallout from the recently released Epstein files — but that can and will change.\n\n“For Mamdani, it was the right thing to do as a leader, but I know he went into it with no illusions about Trump,” de Blasio said. “This is just a moment in time. By next week, they could be at loggerheads easily … This is not gonna be a chummy relationship, I guarantee it.”\n\nSusan Kang, a political science professor at John Jay College and a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, acknowledged the president’s pattern of being blustery in one breath while trying to charm in the next.\n\nWhile it seems unlikely that this new political romance will last, Kang said she’s sensing some cautious optimism.\n\n“There was a lot of fear that Trump would try to destroy this administration, but the evidence suggests that he's not gonna do that,” she said. “In fact, maybe he'll send, maybe he'll reinstate some federal aid, maybe he'll send extra money to build housing.”",

        "text": "Rep. Nydia Velázquez knew it was time to retire when Zohran Mamdani won the New York City mayoral race.\n\n“What I saw during that election was that so many young people were hungry for a change and that they have a clear-eyed view of the problems we face and how to fix them,” Velázquez, D-N.Y., told The Intercept. “That helped convince me that this was the right time to pass the torch.”\n\nVelázquez, a native of Puerto Rico who has served in Congress for more than 30 years, announced her retirement Thursday, in the early days of what is sure to be a frenzied 2026 midterm season across the country and in several solidly Democratic New York districts. She was not facing a notable primary challenger, unlike her House colleagues Hakeem Jeffries, Ritchie Torres, and Adriano Espaillat: three younger New York congressmen who are all considered firmly in line with the Democratic establishment, and all facing challenges from their left.\n\n“She could be in that seat as long as she wants,” said Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, a longtime ally whom Velázquez once described as one of her “children.” “Nydia is at her peak. So that she would go out like that — it’s so Nydia.”\n\nVelázquez is known as something of a den mother for a generation of younger progressive politicians in Brooklyn. She is overwhelmingly popular in her district but made few friends in the local establishment’s clubby machine politics. As Brooklyn’s electorate shifted left over the decades, she built up a formidable stable of protégés in key roles.\n\n“My goal was never to build a machine,” she said. “My goal was to build a bench of strong, independent, progressive public servants who understood who they work for.”\n\nThat will likely set up a competitive race to succeed Velázquez in her left-leaning 7th Congressional District, which includes Mamdani’s home base of Astoria, Queens, and solidly progressive Brooklyn neighborhoods like Bushwick, Williamsburg, and Clinton Hill. The district’s progressive profile means it’s poised to become a hot contest for candidates on the left — and may distract from the controversial candidacy of City Council Member Chi Ossé, who’s waging a long-shot challenge against Jeffries that has mired the city’s Democratic Socialists of America in debate.\n\nVelázquez declined to say who, if anyone, she favored to become her replacement.\n\n“I could leave today and know that the district will be in good hands,” she said.\n\nVelázquez is bowing out at a moment when the “G word” — gerontocracy — can be heard frequently on cable news, and not just on the lips of younger political hopefuls frustrated by an aging party leadership. She joins fellow Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, who announced his decision to retire in September and who has already kicked off a wild, 10-way primary fight in his Upper West Side district.\n\n“She told me she wanted to send a message to Democrats across the country that it is time for the next generation,” said City Council Member Lincoln Restler, a protégé. “Still, every elected official I’ve spoken to is just sad that we’re losing this remarkable moral leader.”\n\nVelázquez saw Mamdani’s promise so early in the mayoral race that she was predicting his win well before many of her younger acolytes did, Reynoso told The Intercept.\n\n“Nydia was always like ‘Zohran is the one, and I think he can win,’” Reynoso said.\n\nAt Mamdani’s victory celebration on November 4, Velázquez was happy to flaunt her prediction. When one supporter joyfully asked if she could believe it, she replied: “I believed it a year ago.”\n\nVelázquez, 72, was first elected in 1992, unseating a nine-term incumbent in the Democratic primary to become the first Puerto Rican woman to serve in Congress. At the time of her primary victory, the New York Times offered readers a guide to the phonetic pronunciation of her name.\n\n“When Nydia Velázquez was first elected to Congress, it was her against the world,” said Restler. “She took on the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, and the entrenched political power in Brooklyn was entirely against her.”\n\nIn 2010, Restler said, “she told me she felt genuinely lonely in Brooklyn, that she had so few allies that she could count on. Fifteen years later, essentially every single person in local and state elected office across her district is there because of her validation, her legitimization, and her support.”\n\nIn the wake of her announcement on Thursday, praise for Velázquez poured in not just from her mentors and close ideological allies, but also from establishment figures closer to the center as well. On X, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called the outgoing congresswoman a “trailblazer” — a hint perhaps at the stable of potential left-wing contenders Velázquez has helped take the playing field over the years.",
